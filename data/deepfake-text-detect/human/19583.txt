Many European countries are creating very restrictive rules for how parents can raise their children. For example, in Germany homeschooling is illegal and parents who home-school their children have actually had their children taken from him. Similarly, parents have been persecuted for refusing to vaccinate their children, and for other medical issues (ex. childhood obesity) where the State believes that it knows better than parents what their own children need. I believe that his reflects the idea, expressed by some liberals that "children belong to the community." I believe that this view is dangerous and anti-family. Parents are biologically hardwired to love their children and want what is best for them. Governments, by contrast, are faceless entities that can not know what is best for any individual child. I believe CAS and other organizations have become tyrannical and their powers should be greatly reigned in and limited to cases of severe and proven physical or sexual abuse CMV. Hello, users of CMV!
