First of all this isnt about whether it exists, right now debating its existence is like debating the shape of the earth. Because of whats known as a feedback loop. Every time the ICCP brings out a new report, things are much worse than was predicted. This is because [feedback loops] perpetually accelerate global warming. They create a vicious cycle where the effects of climate change themselves add to global warming, a terrifying example being the [greenhouse gases trapped under ice sheets all over russia and the artic] which are essentially a ticking timebomb. I believe that this problem could be as apocalyptic as some people say it will, as there is a critical point we are approaching where the feedback loops will be enough on their own to continue climate change at an accelerated rate, perpetuating itself, even if we do everything we can to stop it.
