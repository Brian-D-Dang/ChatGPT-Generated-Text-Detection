Santa's eyes widened, and he slowly turned to face the child. The boy stared into Santa's eyes as if looking through him. "A..... are you sure that's what you want?" Santa asked, hesitantly. A smirk started to appear on the boy's face. He hopped down off Santa's lap and began to back away, before turning and walking to join his parents. "What did you ask Santa for?" the boy's father asked. "Oh nevermind, you shouldn't tell me or it might not come true!" The boy smiled and the family disappeared into the crowd. Santa knew he would have to give the boy what he asked for, the kid was one of the nicest of them all..... or so he thought. Santa hated it but he knew that come Christmas morning..... he would have to murder the boy's family.
