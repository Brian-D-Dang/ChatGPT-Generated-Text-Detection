I don't think I'm better than people who just prefer to believe it, it doesn't harm anyone and is probably an easier way to live. We pretty much all lie to ourselves sometimes, and life after death, I can understand why you'd want to believe that it's true. But, personally, I've never once encountered any evidence or argument that seems at all convincing that our consciousness in any form continues after our neurons stop firing. The "but I just can't imagine that this is it" type of appeal doesn't sway me, humans have lots of natural instinctual beliefsways of seeing things- some are correct, some are wrong. But I'm perfectly willing accept that there in fact is one or more good reason (s), so change my entire worldview:)
