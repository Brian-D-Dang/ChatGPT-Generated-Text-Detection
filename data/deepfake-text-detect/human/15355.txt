Clean facilities, good atmosphere and a strong selection of the latest equipment. What I like most City Athletic Club though, is the idea that it's trainer driven. It provides a space for mutual respect and also unencumbered personal training. Meaning you get the most out of what you're there for. This is the gym for the serious - no matter what level you're at.
