Today a lot of "experts" and ministers of education talk about the importance of teaching kids youth to code because they estimate something like 1.5mill-2million jobs will need these skills in the near future. And so obviously people think that this is a "guaranteed job oppourtunity" But I don't think this is how it'll pan out. Programming only requires a simple computer you can buy for 30 in India. So I am 100 sure that the big companies will outsource these jobs to IndiaChina. It'll simply cost way too much to pay full wage in USEurope when you can have just as hard working people do it for 110 of the price and there is literaly no bi-costs since it's all software. No shipping or material needed.
