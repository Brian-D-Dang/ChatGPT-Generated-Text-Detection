To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example, you can't simply say it's disgusting, because a lot of people find homosexuality disgusting, and society has decided that people's rights shouldn't be inhibited by the disgust of others. Incestuous couples are more likely to have deformed children, but marriage is not about reproduction. Maybe there's some psychological affliction behind it, but homosexuality used to be classified as a disorder as well, but psychologists realized the error of their ways as it became socially acceptable. Of course, any religious objections are right out. So with the last defenses against gay marriage dismantled, I'm left without any good reason why siblings should marry each other. CMV Edit 1: Added emphasis. Edit 2: Stepping away for a bit. I'll be back in a few hours. (8:45pm, GMT) Edit 3: Deltas awarded to: uSquirrelPower for pointing out that there is a legal difference between types of classes. uthe-friendzoner made a similar argument, that the sexual attraction of incest is different than an orientation. I don't consider these sufficient reasons to continue the ban, but they are distinct from the reasons given for banning homosexuality, so they fulfill the terms of my post. Hello, users of CMV!
