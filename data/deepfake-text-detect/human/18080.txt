Basicaly i think that while people could keep their own languages and other habits in their home, having world wide language like English would make it much easier for people to talk, travel, do business. And that with more society becoming more homogeneous people will stop thinking in an us vs them mentality and war and racial strife will diminish. Also a world where everyone is part of one large nation working together for common goals just sounds like a better world than a hundred and nintey some small countries fighting each other.
