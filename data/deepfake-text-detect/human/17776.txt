Japanese got reparations from the concentration camps, and I believe slavery and Jim Crow is just as bad. I actually have family members who had suffered through Jim Crow. Because of slavery, black people were treated as second class citizens up until quite recently. I personally believe that is why many African Americans are in very bad areas right now. In many ways, I believe the effects of slavery are still around. Words such as "Nigger" originated from slavery and are still present today. Personally, I believe Detroit would be much more developed if black people received checks from the government. CMV Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
