Basically I feel there is way too large an emphasis on avoiding causing offence. There was an example recently where children as young as 3 had to sign a contract promising they would not be racist, homophobic, transphobic etc. I feel that this is ludicrous for such a young age. Source: Then there is positive discrimination which I'm also against I feel there should be a system of meritocracy. Instead of quotas for women andor ethnic minorities. I feel the best person should get the job. Then SJW's also profoundly irritate me, I feel they are very sanctimonious. Am I wrong, has political correctness not gone far enough or is it just fine the way it is going. I am always open to changing my view despite how strong my views may seem. Edit: I am not saying I do not support the idea of everyone being equal and being free from discrimination. I am just stating I believe it is being implemented poorly. Edit 2: Seems my opinion is very unpopular.
