In this paper, we discuss the way advanced machine learning techniques allow physicists to perform in-depth studies of the realistic operating modes of the detectors during the stage of their design. Proposed approach can be applied to both design concept (CDR) and technical design (TDR) phases of future detectors and existing detectors if upgraded. The machine learning approaches may speed up the verification of the possible detector configurations and will automate the entire detector RD, which is often accompanied by a large number of scattered studies. We present the approach of using machine learning for detector RD and its optimisation cycle with an emphasis on the project of the electromagnetic calorimeter upgrade for the LHCb detector . The spatial reconstruction and time of arrival properties for the electromagnetic calorimeter were demonstrated.
