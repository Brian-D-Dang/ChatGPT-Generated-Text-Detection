Hello there! This is my first time in CMV so before we go in I just want to say I mean no offense to anybody. So I believe Prostitution should be legal. First of all I figure that as long as all parties involved consent to whatever they plan on doing then it is okay. I also think that legalizing prostitution will allow more money to be generated through taxes, which can go towards funding schools, roads, ect. Finally I believe that legalizing prostitution might create a safer environment for those working as prostitutes. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
