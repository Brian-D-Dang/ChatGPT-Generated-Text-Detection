Today the Supreme Court rejected an appeal by two prisoners to enforce the EU's ruling that prisoners should have the right to vote. Under current UK law they do not. I believe that the right to vote is an inalienable right for all citizens of a country whether they be imprisoned or not. Prisoners are residents of the country and are affected by the government in power both internally and externally. For example tax rates on things such as inheritance tax measures affecting their family outside of prison. I do not believe that the right of the prison population to vote would result in a rise in extremist votes - only those prisoners politically motivated to do so will. Turnout at the last election was around 35. The U.K.'s population is 65 million people and prison population is around 90,000, meaning that prisoners can have their right to vote under European law without impacting heavily on electoral statistics.
