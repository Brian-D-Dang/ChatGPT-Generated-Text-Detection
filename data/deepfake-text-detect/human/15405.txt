Dear 4TWNT, We started off rocky a week ago with a porchetta sandwich that was a little light on the por and super heavy on the.... uh.... etta? More fat, less meat. There we go. Tamar loves you guys though, and she's like my Jewish mom. Mom said go back. I did. And I'm happy I did. The chicken salad sandwich is pretty spectacular. It's served on toasty sourdough along side some greens with a zippy little dressing that's a lil sweet and a lil sour. Chicken isn't overly dressed in thick mayo-y mayhem. It's super light, packs quite a punch, and you should love knowing it's local. Not typically a dessert eater pie grabbed my eye, and when I asked the gent for a rec (Scott maybe?) he said blackberry was the way to go. And so I went there. He warmed that bad boy up post sandie and then I shoveled it in my mouth the second he dropped it off. Seriously at one point I remember saying to myself (internally) take a break.... you've been going at this thing, you're in public.... breathe.... enjoy. But it was too good. Flaky crust. Tart berry inside. Coarse sugar sprinkled atop. The only thing missing was cloyingly sweet aftertaste and corn syrup which they apparently don't use to bind fruit. (Big ups for that.) And now a plea: Furniture builders of Madison.... craft a cool table to run the entire length of the wall and give these guys more seating. They're growing, and it'll be impossible soon (like tomorrow) for mass peeps to eat and enjoy. Donate a mean mesa and I bet they'll put your cards out and tell everyone they know about your rad add. (Hell I'll even write a review solely on the cool community table you build).
