Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I either a) I don't know b) I don't like or c) I'm not friends with. Except I'm getting a lot of crap because my friends in relationships (I'm single) want to bring their partners who all fall into one of the three above categories. Why should I host people that I don't want to, and who, chances are, don't want to be there anyway? But right now my views are more important than my problems. Is it a major etiquette fuckup if you don't invite plus ones? Should I just suck it up? Change my view! Edit: Okay, view changed. Thank you reddit. I awarded deltas for those who either made me think about the consequences of any decision I choose to make, or made me consider the situation my friends are going to be in if I do say "no plus ones." Thank you!
