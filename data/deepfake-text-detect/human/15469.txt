We recently bought a mid-century house and had no furniture for a couple of the rooms. We went to the Rubin's Clearance Center and happened to catch their moving sale, which meant that everything was marked down below their normal clearance price. Nice! You won't pay Ikea prices, but this is, for the most part, high-quality stuff. Real leather, real wood (for most items), etc. There are a few with scratches and dents, and many items are floor models, but for the most part, that doesn't bother me. We got a really good deal on a chair that apparently someone had ordered but came with the wrong fabric. We also left with a shelfstorage unitdrawer thing, a desk, and a rolling chair. The manager threw in a few gift-y items I had picked out, too. The downside is, the salesperson (not the manager), kept reminding us that it was 20 minutes until closing time. This started a half hour before (believe me, I used to work in retail, and I know the oh, you have a half hour before we close trick). We were out of there ten minutes before they closed, so it's not like we were making them stay late. If you're making commission on a sale which could be several thousand dollars (it ended up under 2K, but still), you shouldn't be pushing people out the door. I might have picked up a couple of other items if I hadn't felt rushed out.
