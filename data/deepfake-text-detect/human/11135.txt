Am I correct in assuming you're asking about this in relation to Hillary using one during her speech during her fund raiser? It's not something deployed against crowds, it's more deployed against eavesdropping. White noise is just random sounds which span a whole spectrum of frequencies. This drowns out the signal you're trying to listen in on, in a difficult-to-reverse way. If I were giving a speech and didn't want you to hear me, I have a few options. The most awesome thing I could do would be to drown out my speech by blasting Queen's Greatest Hits towards anybody I didn't want listening in. If you were outside my venue, you can't understand what I'm saying because it's being drowned out by tight vocals and driving rhythms. BUT, if you were recording my speech, you might be able to figure it out. Since everybody's familiar with Queen's Greatest Hits, a computer could listen to the whole thing and work out: If A is the recorded signal... A JRubal Queen B Queen A-B JRubal Queen - Queen A-B JRubal's speech White noise floods the spectrum. Since it's random and unpredictable it can be very difficult to separate the noise from the signal (my speech). Caveat: This is mostly extrapolated from a very basic knowledge of the definition of white noise.
