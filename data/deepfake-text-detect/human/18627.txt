I believe that it would cause students to not only have a broader view of the world around them outside of their social bubble but also have an appreciation for other's views. I have to stress this would be a world religion class teaching of not only the main ones like Christianity, Judaism and Islam but also Buddhism, Sikhism, Jainism and others. Teaching about the beliefs they hold, why they hold them and where these beliefs might have come from from both an insider and outsider view. I think this would be a great forum for students to ask questions and learn something they might believe is just a load of horse crap but also that some other person believes with their heart and soul. I know it would be an absolute logistic nightmare instituting it and having someone teach it while being completely impartial but that is completely irrelevant to this view.
