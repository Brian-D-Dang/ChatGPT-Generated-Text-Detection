I always see celebrities complaining about being in the public eye and having to deal with the paparazzi. I think that if you make to decision to have your face publicly displaced, you should be willing accept any criticism that come with that. Like everything in life, with good comes the bad. I trade less free time for a stable living condition. Celebrities trade the fame they have for a lack of privacy. It just really seems like a fair trade off for anybody who decides to take advance of their fame. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
