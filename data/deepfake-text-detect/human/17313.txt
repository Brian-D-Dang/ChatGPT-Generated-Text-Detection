When discussing people in altered states, including those brought about through organic pathology or "mental" illnesses like schizophrenia and psychotic depression, it is inappropriate and false to state such individuals are less in contact with reality. The reason is that nobody experiences reality directly. By this, I mean that you see, hear, taste, smell and feel nothing that is not filtered, processed or otherwise distorted by your brain. So why does your brain filter, process and distort sensory information? Because your perceptual faculties are shaped by evolutionary pressures. There is a selection advantage to accentuate survival maximising data that your senses pick up, and also to minimise sense-data that does not confer some sort of advantage, be it survival andor reproductive. That is to say that nobody's brain is selected for directly perceiving reality. Only selected for perceiving elements of reality that relate to survival and promotion of genes. So, I don't understand why it is appropriate to say that because someone who is psychotic, or under the effect of hallucinogens, has less legitimate contact with reality. In fact, with psilocybin, brain regions that limit one's perception are temporarily inhibited and if anything, a more direct way of perceiving reality may be achieved. (I am not a neuroscientist) The only sense in which it is appropriate to say that someone that deviates from normal mental functioning is less in contact with reality is to say that they are less in contact with 'consensual reality', which is by no means identical to actual reality.
