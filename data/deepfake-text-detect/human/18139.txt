I propose launching our nuclear waste into outer space, and I can't see any reasons why this is a bad idea. I can see a few places where it might be unfeasible, but that doesn't excuse our lack of research on such a program. It seems obvious to seal waste into capsules and eject them from Earth's gravitational field, free to spin off into the void until they are inert. The potential consequences of a failed launch seem dire if we use liquid-fuel rockets, but keep in mind that a canister of waste has may fewer constraints than a delicate satellite. It doesn't need precision guidance. It doesn't need to achieve orbit velocity, only escape velocity. It can experience as many g's as required during launch. So I propose using an electromagnetic rail-gun to hurl them into space. No volatile fuels, and no half-launches. It goes or it doesn't move an inch. My brother's objection to this plan was that it would pollute other planets with radioactive waste when the capsules eventually hit another planet, but keep in mind that space is big! The capsules will have almost completely decayed and reached such low levels of radioactivity as to be called inert by the time they reach anything else.
