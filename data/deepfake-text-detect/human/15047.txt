As a fervent Yelper, I read many reviews before booking a room at the Excalibur for my 21st birthday weekend. I came frugal-minded, knowing that I would not do much sleeping and keeping in mind a certain Yelper's admonition you get what you pay for I got even less than what I paid for. I booked a week in advance, for Saturday and Sunday night. I picked the cheapest standard room for Saturday and a Spa Suite for Sunday, Sunday being the much cheaper night of the two. When I came on Saturday, they sent me right to an upgraded room. This would have been cool if it was a Smoking King bed like I wanted instead of a Non smoking double. My 6 foot big ass boyfriend and I cannot fit in no double bed. I called room service to get this rectified and came in contact with the rudest, bitchiest motherfucking concierges I have ever encountered. These assholes need a lesson in customer service from my foot in their asses. They told me I was in no way guaranteed the room I ordered, and that I should be happy they upgraded me. I said I didn't give a shit, and I want the room I paid for. I asked them what guarantee I would have that the next night's spa suite and they said none I promptly cancelled the next night's reservation. We did have to stay that night in the Excalibur. So I might as well review the room. Which was shitty and had a shitty view and hat the shittiest bed linens ever. The hotel smelled like shit, looked like shit and had rude concierges. Also the bathrooms have no tubs, just standing showers. The patrons at Excalibur are even creepier and smellier and drunker than in the nicer casinos. I got a room at the Mirage for a barely any more and it was 10000000x better. Check my review for the Mirage, and DONT STAY AT THE EXCALIBUR.
