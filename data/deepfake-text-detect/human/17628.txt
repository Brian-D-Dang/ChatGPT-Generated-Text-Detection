Let me preface this with: I am still unsure as to whether I believe in supporting the 2nd Amendment at this point in time, particularly because it seems anachronistic, yet, I don't think it will ever be possible to remove all guns from the hands of all criminalscrazies. Alas! That is not the point of this CMV, I would respectfully appreciate discussion remaining on-topic here. Thank you. A gun is a weapon. Period. A tool can be used constructively as well as destructively, like an axe or a knife or a hammer, etc. A gun's purpose is to kill (man or animal), in self defense or not, whether or not you use it as such, is a different matter (ala hunting vs target practice). I don't include squirtpaintlaser guns as weapons for obvious reasons. Now, fault for murder lies ONLY in the hands if heshe who uses the weapon as such. You can't blame a weapon any more than you can blame a camera for illegal pornography. They may be essential in the particular crime you're talking about at the time, but they aren't responsible. Thank you for your time and reasoned arguments.
