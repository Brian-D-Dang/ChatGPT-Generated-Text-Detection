I am a student who regularly takes a cocktail of anti-depressants, mood-stabilizers, and ADHD medicines, (including Adderall and Prozac) and it works great for me. I have been taking them ever since I was in preschool. People keep telling me that kind of stuff is bad for you, that it messes you up, that it's worse than taking no medicine at all, but all I have had are great results, and I show no signs of brain damage whatsoever. I have seen posts from people saying that medicines like this ruined them, but I honestly don't know what they're talking about. When I don't take them, I just have worse days in general. Are my meds really that bad for me? Change my view.
