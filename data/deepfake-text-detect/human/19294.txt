I've lived in the US South for my entire adult life, and find myself surrounded by people that live in bubbles of their own belief systems. Many are openly hostile to any sort of change and most are informed almost solely by Fox, the GOP, the NRA, Rush, Hanity, O'Reilly, fundamentalism, and prejudice. I find that I'm increasingly predjudiced against narrowmindedness, and am perhaps getting narrow minded in that regard myself. Why should we be openminded and inclusive of knee jerk reactionaries who are bastions of negativity and hate? Why suffer fools?
