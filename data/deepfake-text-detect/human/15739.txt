I just got home from Salon Salon and I'm really happy with the way it turned out! Page took care of my cut and color, it was my 1st time getting my hair professionally colored, she did several different shades and it came out better then I expected. Also better then expected was the price:) I think I have finally found the salon I have been looking for, YAY!
