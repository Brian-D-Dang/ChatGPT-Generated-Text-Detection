The charter basically says that public servants cannot wearshow religious symbols. For ex: a cross will have to be tucked under the shirt not to be seen. A hijab will have to be removed and a Kippah will have to be removed. This creates a major problem for Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, Hasidic Jews and any other religious people who have to wear certain symbolsclothing that are very visible. Why I am against this charter of values. 1. It goes against Freedom of religion and Freedom of Expression. 2. A lot of the people who will have to remove something that is part of their faith, plan on leaving (Ontario all ready made ads to get people wanting to leave to move there) 3. Teachers, doctors,nurses and some other professions in Quebec don't have much people in them, and will be even worse now because of this charter. I understand some of the opposing arguments, which are. 1- Doctors, teachers and other public workers get discriminated against because of their religion, some people won't want to be treated by a Muslim doctor, so this charter will remove the discrimination factor. Another argument is 2-In Quebec we have our French culture and our Quebec culture, and if we don't pass this charter we will eventually lose everything. Both my counter arguments are as followed. 1. You will cause the doctor to leave and hundreds of patients will be left with no doctor, same applies to teachers, hundreds of students will be left with no teacher (and as I said we lack in these professions). 2. So because you fear your culture will not last, your solution is to remove other cultures.....I think that speaks for its self. I would like someone to give other sides (except for the two I showed, unless you want to elaborate on them) to this argument. For more information (if you wanna look deeper into the Charter) i got this for you I can't seem to find the actual charter with everything that will be included in it. Sorry. CMV Thanks!
