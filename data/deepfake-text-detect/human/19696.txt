Let me preface this by saying that rape is horrible. I do not condone rape, there is no justification for rape, "she was asking for it" is not an excuse, and rapists are the worst of the worst. I am 100 anti-rape and anti-rapist. BUT. I think as with any risk, there are certain factors that can increase or decrease the odds of something bad happening. I believe that if, say, a girl gets raped at a high school party, it's not some kind of evil taboo to look at what she was doing for the purposes of learning how to decrease the risk of being raped. For example, was she blackout drunk? I don't believe that asking this so I can point to this poor girl and tell the girls I teach "going to a party and getting blackout drunk will increase your risk of being rape" is such a horrible thing. I know about the whole "instead of teaching girls to avoid being raped, we should teach boys not to rape" argument, and I believe it. But until I can teach every male on earth not to touch my hypothetical future daughter (s), I'd like to look at what factors contributed to a rape so my future daughter (s) can try to avoid them. I don't know, it seems like a lot of people think I'm a horrible person for this opinion and I'd like to hear the counter-argument. Please CMV.
