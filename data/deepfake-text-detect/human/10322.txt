I was just reading [this thread] where everyone keep saying that morality is subjective. I honestly think that it's not, morality is objective, everyone knows at any time what would be the most morally correct thing to do, and that the problem is doing it instead, since actually doing it would come with a price that you may not be prepared to pay, therefore saying that the moral thing to do is the opposite. You might say that in the past century the moral compass has changed and yadda yadda, and we all know that it is simply not true. Morality never changed a bit. What people are willing to do for morality has changed. I expect some answers to clarify the concept of "moral," and I think it can be stated as "the most moral action is the one that causes the least possible amount of grief."
