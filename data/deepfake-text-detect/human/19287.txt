My understanding of C-3P0 is that he serves mainly as comic relief in the movies. However, he's in way too many scenes to the point that he just gets annoying. C-3PO does nothing to drive the story forward. I feel that you could actually remove him from all of the films and the plots wouldn't really change that much. The only thing he's good at is language interpretations, but he doesn't fill that role often enough to justify him getting so much screen time. If C-3PO was in fewer scenes, he would be a decent character, but the fact that he's in so many, and the fact that he's actually kind of useless, really damages our enjoyment of the character. Who do you think is the worst character in the Star Wars movies, and why is that character worse than C-3PO? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
