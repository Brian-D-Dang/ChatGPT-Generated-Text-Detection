Estimates show that the average american uses around 4 times the resources that the planet could support, if everyone was an American. These numbers are somewhat lower in Western Europe, however still double what the planet could support at 8 billion people. My point is the more that people in developed countries accumulate wealth, the less wealth there will be for developing and undeveloped countries to accumulate. If we do not accept that our material wealth must remain stagnant from now on in places such as America, and Europe; countries in places such as Africa and Asia will forever be stuck in a low income way of life.
