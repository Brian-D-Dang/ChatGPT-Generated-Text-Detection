Assuming a consequentialist understanding of right and wrong. Not deontological. Another thing: I'm thinking on a cosmic scale here. Not just people living right now on earth. And not just the next generation. Basically, how can I know how my actions will effect some sentient race of aliens living in Alpha Centauri a million years from now? Assuming all sentient beings are equally deserving of moral treatment (not privileging humanity). Am I drastically overestimating chaos theory? Or is there a good reason I should consider the immediate effects of my actions and not the far reaching ones?
