Now, the reason I came up with this view is because I saw a girl with a shirt with bullet points for consent and sober was one of them. The basis of the argument is that those under the influence aren't in complete (or any) control of their actions. Basically, "blame it on the alcohol." However, I find this to be inaccurate because if someone can't be blamed for their actions while drunk why is it that there are campaigns telling drunk people not to drive drunk. Obviously, it seems there's hypocrisy running amuck. Can someone sway me one way or the other on this topic of "actions while drunk"? Thanks. edit: Some of you say this is being taken advantage of, please assume that if the girl (or guy) says no to having sex with someone that the person trying to have sex with them disengages. There is no "being taken advantage" of in this situation because the girl (or guy) is free to say no while drunk. To continue to argue said point makes me believe that everyone assumes that drunk people can't say no. This in and of itself is a completely separate argument. Hello, users of CMV!
