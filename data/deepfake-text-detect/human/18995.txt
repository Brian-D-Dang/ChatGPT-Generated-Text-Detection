Right now, I have a carton of egg nog with an date on it that says "010515." If the date today is 010315, I feel that given the date on the container that the egg nog within is near a point where you should no longer ingest it. It is my opinion that since the contents of the container are near expiration, that the "decomposition" process has begun and should be thrown out. "Sell by" dates only offer me more uncertainty as to when I should stop ingesting the contents. TLDR: Expiration dates are times when the contents of a container are spoiled. So, I think you should throw them out prior to this date. Additionally, "sell by" dates are worse because you have no idea when the contents will expire. Edit: My V has been C'd. The dates don't mean even close to what I thought they did, and I could just use some common sense instead of some ink printing on a container. Thanks to all who responded. Hello, users of CMV!
