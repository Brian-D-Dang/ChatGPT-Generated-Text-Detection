In response to yesterday's frontpage post: [FEMA to deny funds to warming deniers] . I believe this is a no-brainer. FEMA is a federal agency tasked with disaster readiness and after-the-fact disaster relief. It is a financially and ethically correct decision to not give preparedness money to state EMAs who refuse to prepare for the effects of climate change. For people who didn't read the article, FEMA is not giving disaster preparation money to state EMAs who do not have climate change contingencies in their disaster preparedness plans. There is nothing stopping FEMA from helping with disasters after the fact. There are plenty of times in the past when the federal government has moved the hand of state governments in exchange for funding, or required states to act without federal funding. The only reason I see for people to be opposed to the measure is blind hate of Obama's administration, who hasn't even been shown to have be involved in this decision making process; or legitimate climate change deniers, for whom there is no hope. This is not a CMV on climate change itself. The climate is changing and humans are contributing to it. The scientific evidence at this point is insurmountable and looking at two sides of the "debate": scientists vs lobbyists, I know who I back. Hello, users of CMV!
