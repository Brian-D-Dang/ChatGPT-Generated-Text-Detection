Often when homes are foreclosed on or go up for auction for whatever reason, the new owner is responsible for any back taxes owed or liens on the property. I think this is wrong because it is a disincentive to buy the house if you have to pay thousands in somebody else's taxes right off the bat. Many homes just sit and sit because they aren't worth buying due to back taxes. Also it varies by municipality, but it can be difficult to accurately find out whether or not a home actually has back taxes or not. So you blindly have to put in a bid and hope that there aren't back taxes owed on it. This only opens the game up to people in the industry and it's an unfair advantage in my opinion. Basically I think if you live somewhere for however many years without paying taxes, the taxes should follow you, not the property. EDIT: I'm trying to discern what makes property taxes special compared to other taxes. If I owe 20,000 to the IRS because I haven't paid income taxes in years, the person who takes my job after I left doesn't suddenly become responsible for that.
