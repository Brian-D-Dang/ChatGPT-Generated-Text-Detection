To clarify: When living in this matrix world, nobody is aware that they are living inside a machine and experiencing an illusion. It is also not possible for these people to break out of the system. The term "evil" describes anything that a person can do that would cause intentional harm to another person. For example, there would be no such thing as murder or stealing in this world. We would not have the mental capacityabilities to carry out such acts. I also want to add on that in addition to not being able to make "evil" choices, people inside this matrix can only make "good" choices whereby "good" choices are defined as either an action that brings some sort of benefit to someone else or an action that causes no harm to anyone. For example, I see that you have spilled your groceries outside your car. I have no obligation to help you, but I can either make one of two choices: help you pick up your groceries or ignore the situation provided that I have ascertained no one will be in significant harm's way. One final clarification to help people understand the scenario I'm creating: I want to stress that we aren't "robots" per se. Think of it this way: if you were in this matrix world, you would still be you. You would retain your personality, your physical attributes, your thoughts, etc. but you just would no longer have the capacity to think "evil" thoughts or conduct "evil" actions.
