I'm not going to say that I actively try to be nice to other people. That would be lying and nobody on the internet lies (s). But for the most part I used to try to not be a dick to people. I also try not to care about what people think about me. I find myself heavily leaning, however, to the latter. If I don't care what people think about me, why should I care about being an asshole? I'm much more inclined to believe that if you think I'm a dick then you need to grow some gonads because fuck what you think of me. And then my mother pops into my head and slaps me on the soft spot. So I've been trying really hard recently to find a balance between the two, but I still feel that the "don't be an asshole" mantra is just something that pansies use as an excuse. So I suppose this isn't so much as a CMV as much as a "give me a reason as to why I should care about not being a major dick." I apologize if this is the wrong sub. P.S. I'm not referring to being straight-out sociopathic, like domestic violence and similar. I'm referring more to "hey, wanna grab a beer?" "Fuck no" if that makes any sense. Hello, users of CMV!
