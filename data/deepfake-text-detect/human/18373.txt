As I see it, the only good effect of speculation is to "fluidify" the market, but we've come the point where it is vastly more efficient to divert wealth (via speculation) than to actually create wealth. I'm expecting most of the answers to be "state owned banks wouln't be able to fluidify the market the way it is now," if so is there a way to avoid that the private sector rips all the benefits of speculation?
