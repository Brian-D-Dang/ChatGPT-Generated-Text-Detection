AFAIK, the biggest issue many people have about drones seems to be collateral damage on civilians. I won't be touching upon assassinations of civilians in foreign nations as it's a whole different issue. Assassinations of civilians is independent from drones; take for example Osama Bin Laden. [This recent VICE video shows some of the anti drone sentiments.] I really don't see the problem with Drones; it seems as if the arguments against them are actually are arguments against warfare itself. Whenever there is a war, civilians always suffer and are caught in the crossfire. The reporter's comments about Skynet is incredibly ignorant IMHO. Computers only do what it is programmed to do; nothing more, nothing less. These drones are essentially over glorified RC vehicles. What's difference in an attack done by a drone and manned vehicle? They both have collateral damage from the explosives used. The drone operators are not in direct danger of dying, so the costs of training drone operators is probably less than training fighter pilots as they do not get killed in action. When fighter pilots are on long missions, they have to stay awake the whole time, which negatively affects their performance. Drone operators can be switched off (I'm not sure if that's the protocol, but it makes sense) during a mission.
