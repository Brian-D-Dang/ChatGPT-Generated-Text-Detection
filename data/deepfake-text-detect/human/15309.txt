Tim (Mgr) and the rest of the staff are always friendly. Nice selection of baked goods and soup (during the winter months). Coffee is always good. But the building it's housed in is falling apart. Numerous water leaks inside from a shoddy roof. They even have a sign on the wall next to one of the tables warning you of a leak. The carpeting is in desperate need of cleaning and the furniture is filthy and thread bare. This has been my go-to place for coffee since 2012 but that's going to stop. Just can't stomach the conditions inside this coffee house any longer. Hopefully the building owner will get motivated and fix the leaks and they do a thorough cleaning of the place.
