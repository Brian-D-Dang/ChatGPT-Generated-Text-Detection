Co-simulation consists of the theory and techniques to enable globalsimulation of a coupled system via the composition of simulators. Despite thelarge number of applications and growing interest in the challenges, the fieldremains fragmented into multiple application domains, with limited sharing ofknowledge. This tutorial aims at introducing co-simulation of continuous systems,targeted at researchers new to the field.
