To know anything at all for sure, one will need the instrument of logic. However, there is no way to show human logic is correct logic, as such a proof would require logic and therefore be circular. In other words: there is nothing you can deduce without assumptions. This means that everything needs assumptions, meaning nothing can be proven, because you need assumptions that need assumptions to be proven that need assumptions to be proven, and so on. This either get's you to an end where you have to conclude there is nothing you can prove, or where something proves itself (which seems to me to be impossible without circular reasoning) or an infinite regress, which I don't think there is when it comes to proving something simple like "the outside world is real." Descartes tried to reason without assumptions, be he still had to assume human intuition about logic is valid. He even had to assume some kind of god to prove the reality of an outside world, showing that even he can't prove anything. Edit: View changed. About to reward deltas to two people, don't know if that works. Edit 2: Appearantly I can award two deltas. Oh also: I don't really need more people commenting, my view has been changed. I like to argue so I'm not really against it, but just know it won't have any use anymore.
