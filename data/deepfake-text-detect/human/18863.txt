I get that four years give host cities enough time to prepare for the human onslaught. But with a simple system of scheduling who gets to host what year further on into the future, future host cities can prepare just as well and in time. Yes, four years can give the games more hype and what not, but I believe that 2 years is more than enough and even 2 years is a painful wait. There will be just as much anticipation in 2 years as in 4. Just look at how we go crazy over Super Bowl every damn year. Oh, and having cities host the games every two years gives more cities the opportunity to cash in on the games. Plus, it will raise more awareness to the game worldwide since the ad campaigns and hype for the games are more frequent. The 4 years is too long, 2 is just right. Lastly, think of the players. The World Cup is arguably the greatest canvas in which to demonstrate their mastery. But they only get this chance every 4 years and who knows what will happen in 4 years (injuries and retirement). Let them play every 2 years so their talent does not go to waste and so that they can achieve their dreams. I don't give a damn about people who think waiting 4 years makes it more special, I really cannot buy that argument because 2 years is still a long time and when your own country is playing for honor and glory, IT WILL ALWAYS BE SPECIAL. But this is subjective so please CMV with something objective. Am I missing some crucial factor? Thanks BE THE REDS! edit: if you agree with me, I'd like to know as well! But play devil's advocate!
