I really don't get all the hype for the movie the Fifth Element. I think I almost fell asleep during the film at least once and while I get it's not supposed to be the most believable sci fi film I still didn't find it that funny or interesting. Normally, I'm a fan of Bruce Willis and Luc Besson but I just could not get into this film. And I am normally a huge fan of sci fi and action movies. I'm open to fans trying to convince me of why I should like the movie and maybe rematch the movie because I know there are a lot of fans of the film on reddit!
