Actually, it's a little more complicated than that. I believe that anyone who needs treatment should be able to get it, and without putting themselves in absurd amounts of debt. But I also believe that people should be able to do pretty much whatever they want as long as it doesn't interfere with anyone else. Clearly, there's a contradiction here. If I do something stupid and hurt myself, why should you have to pay for it? Before you tell me about how awesome the free market is and how it will solve all our problems, I should warn you that I'm pretty familiar with that argument, and it hasn't managed to convince me so far. What I'm really looking for is a compromise, where you don't have private companies trying to screw over their sick customers, but I don't have to pay for some guy's heroin addiction. I have some thoughts on the matter myself, but I want to hear what other people think.
