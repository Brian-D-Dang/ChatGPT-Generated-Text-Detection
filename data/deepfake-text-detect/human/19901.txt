in modern society: women are viewed as the gate keepers to fertility, sexual prowess and above all property of men. Yet men are viewed in life as completely expendable. The classic sinking ship scenario: women and children first, men last. In war, natural disasters or acts of terrorism nobody cares if a 10 men die but if 1 woman or a child dies it's a heinous crime against humanity. I feel these gender roles are predetermined from an evolutionary bilogical stance.
