I loved this place! We came here on one of our last days on Vegas and found it while walking around the Golden Nugget. When we sat down to take a look at the Menu's, I decided to look on yelp and see what the reviews were. Once I saw the 4 star rating, I know I was going to be impressed. When I said take a look at the Menu, it took awhile due to there being lots to choose from! We had a table of 6 and we ordered pretty much everything from breakfast to lunch. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and all I have to say is WOW! These were probably the best Eggs Benedict I have tasted in a long long time. I also ordered a short stack of pancakes which were also pretty tasty. The customer service was awesome as well! You definitely need to stop on by if you're in the Golden Nugget!
