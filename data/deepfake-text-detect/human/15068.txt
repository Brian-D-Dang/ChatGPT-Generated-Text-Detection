While several dishes were very good i.e. falafel and hummus, twice we have been burned by entrees. A roast chicken was obviously reheated and came out with a rubberlike texture and a beef shwarma was as tough as Tupperware. The kitchen has quality control issues but hopefully is talented enough to remedy them in the future.
