A study at Columbia University Irving Medical Center has found that Far-UVC light can safely kill 99.9 of seasonal coronaviruses present in airborne droplets. Conventional UV lamps can kill viruses but they aren't used in occupied public spaces as they are a potential health hazard. Far-UFC light cannot reach or damage living cells in the body, which makes it feasible and safe to use in occupied indoor public places, significantly reducing the risk of person-to-person transmission of viruses.
