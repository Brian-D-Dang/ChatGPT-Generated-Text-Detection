This comic shows the kind of people I'm talking about (minus the costume, physical violence, and actually being outside). These people try to sound smart and learn the "proper" way to argue but just make a fool of themselves. 1. I'll say; "Women aren't biologically lesser in intelligence to men you stupid idiot" 2. They will say, "I may be an insufferable idiot, but you called me one so I'm right and I win, QED." 1. This is a copy and paste argument from Stormfront, this isn't worth my time to read 2. GENETIC FALLACY!! QED! PRAISE THE FOUR HORSEMEN!!!!!1111ONE These people compensate for not knowing what the fuck they're actually talking about by trying to learn some "rules of default" they can "win" by. If you do anything aside from saying exactly what they said, agreeing with it, and adding on "You're smart, handsome, have a gigantic penis, and women just friendzone you because you're too nice." Then you are pulling a "straw-man." I'm glad that people have taken time from fapping to sailor moon and "schoolin Fundi3s" to read a wikepedia article relating to philosophy in some way, but actually arguing issues isn't like their table top RPGs. There are no default "rules" to doing so aside from being fucking coherent. Sure, if someone is ONLY calling you names, than maybe you can discredit what they say, but most of the time its not the case. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
