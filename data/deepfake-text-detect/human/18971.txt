On the radio at work there has been a discussion about whether or not teachers have come out to their students, and why they have or not. Last week Joel Gray came out as gay at 82, and it was big news. I've never known anybody come out to me, but I do know a few gay people. My friends are my friends, regardless of their sexuality. To say that "I don't care" if they're gay or straight may sound harsh, but in the end, it's none of my business who they choose to love. I am not gay, so perhaps I am missing something critical here. But in my view, the very act of coming out serves to perpetuate the mentality that homosexuality is abnormal. Change my view! Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
