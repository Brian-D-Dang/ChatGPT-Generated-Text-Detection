Years have passed since he stole our cradle from us. We do not capitalize his name, for he is no god worthy of respect. He came crashing down in blistering light, surrounded by his heavenly horde. They swarmed Earth, ripping families apart and slaughtering those that resisted. There were no gentle ascensions into the sky; the "chosen ones" were herded aboard glittering vessels and carted away like so much livestock. Once the resistance had been dismantled, "god" returned to his domain upon pillars of fire. Not a word was spoken between he and the humans that had spread out into the solar system. We assume that he views us with disdain for leaving the world he tailored to raise us. Let him continue to do so. We have since spread to nearby star systems. Their fires and orbiting planets bear no mark of life or "god." So, we claimed them as our own. We are shaping those barren globes to our tastes and needs. We are expanding our empire, harnessing all that the cosmos offers us. Should he ever return to claim the rest of his "children," they will resist. We have conquered the void between suns. We have claimed worlds as our own without his aid. He robbed humanity of their cradle, but he can not touch our empire. The heavens belong to humanity, now. The godly heaven will soon be ours as well. Tremble, god, for we will come to reclaim our stolen brethren.
