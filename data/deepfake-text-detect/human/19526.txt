I see no inherent offensive meaning or implication for many common profane words, and, thus, do not understand why they are so unacceptable in common conversation as a method of expression. These words are often used in offensive statements, however they lack intrinsic meaning and act only as emphasis for the rest of the sentence, and, thus, without them, the sentence would still have the exact same offensive meaning. Because of this common relation with offensive statements, these words can no longer be used to emphasize other statements which would warrant the use of them to add expression. I don't understand why people are (and kids are taught to be) afraid of profane words which carry no inherent meaning. CMV Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
