Tax treatment, in flight meals, seating preferences, alternate testing dates, and special consideration of any kind that is offered in exchange for verification of religious observance is unfair to people without religion. Secular people who have preferences (arbitrary or not) which are not accommodated on a special request basis, where religious accommodations are made, are having their interests subordinated. Institutions are acting on the premise that religiously motivated predilections deserve more respect, concern, deference, and action than those derived from other reasons. From a secular point of view, respecting the beliefs, preferences, and interests of religious people may be fine so long as the same courtesy is offered for non-religious reasons to non-religious people. At least in American society, this is not the case. The reductio ad absurdum might be: In American (probably other liberal countries) society, it is in the best interest of atheists to fabricate a "religion" in order to give equal weight to their interests. Edit: So far interesting points are: 1. This is a result of economics not unjust preference. But, then special treatment should be allowed for in all situations where economically viable and not only scrutinized when spurred by non-religious reasons. 2. Society must scrutinize religious beliefs, actions, and preferences as well as secular ones and this should be done on an equal footing. 3. 501 (c) (3) s are a mess
