The United States Military has different physical entry [requirements] for men and women. The physical entry requirements should be the exact same for men and women because they are held to the same standard. (Now that women are able to assume combat positions) This is not only in the military, certain public safety departments are [lowering their standards] so women can pass the physical portion of the test. I believe that lowering the standard for women is degrading towards women and is insinuating that they aren't capable of doing the job as well as men are. Please Change My View! Hello, users of CMV!
