I say this even though I am a Democrat and right now the Senate is in the hands of Democrats. Throughout most of its history, the Senate has simply functioned as a road block to legislation that the public wants, not to protect the legal rights of the minority (that's the function of the Supreme Court) but to protect the undemocratic interests of the few. Even when one party is in power, the other party has numerous means of stalling and killing legislation. We need a constitutional amendment stating that "The Senate shall be abolished, and all its powers transferred to the House of Representatives." Perhaps the amendment could grant a minimum of 2 or 3 representatives to every state so that the smallest states would be less likely to object. The Senate, of course, would never pass such an amendment, but it's possible that 34 of the states would. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
