In this paper, we focus on the meta distribution for the cache-enabled networks where the locations of base stations (BSs) are modeled as Poisson point process (PPP). Under the random caching framework, we derive the moments of the conditional successful transmission probability (STP), the exact meta distribution and its beta approximation by utilizing stochastic geometry. The closed-form expression of the mean local delay is also derived. We consider the maximization of the STP and the minimization of the mean local delay by optimizing the caching probability and the BS active probability, respectively. For the former, a convex optimization problem is formulated and the optimal caching probability and BS active probability are achieved. Moreover, most popular caching (MPC) is proved to optimal under the constraint that the mean local delay is finite. For the latter, a non-convex optimization problem is formulated and an iterative algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal solution. The backhaul delay has a significant influence on the caching strategy. MPC is proved to be optimal when the backhaul delay is relatively low and the uniform caching (UC) is the optimal caching strategy when the backhaul delay is very large. Finally, the numerical results reveal the effect of the key network parameters on the cache-enabled networks in terms of STP, variance, meta distribution and mean local delay.
