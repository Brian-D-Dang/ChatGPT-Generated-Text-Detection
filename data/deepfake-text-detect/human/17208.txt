"Captain Phillips" is a recent movie starring Tom Hanks about a true story involving a sea freighter being attacked by armed Somali pirates. Without going into too many SPOILERS the gist of it for this discussion involves how when confronted by the prospect of pirates the best the crew could do was to alert the maritime security command, deploy water hoses, and try to swamp the oncoming skiffs. However, once the pirates boarded, the crew of a dozen plus men became helpless against four armed pirates with AK47s. Only, the wit and wisdom of Captain Phillips and his crew kept them alive, although Phillips was himself taken hostage. If the crew had armed security or at least had guns stored on the ship in case of emergencies like this, the incident would probably never have happened.
