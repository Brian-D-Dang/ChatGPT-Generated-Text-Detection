I believe if someone is trying to get across a message there is no purpose in getting all the grammar correct, if the message is still clearly understood by people and makes sense. This isn't a dig at 'Grammar Nazi's,' more just a general view on language itself, as simply put I just don't see the point in lots of it. I must point out I still like to read and understand how writing something fluently and interestingly is nice to read, however in everyday use I still see it as an over-complexity that isn't needed. I see this miss-use of grammar or words as more of an evolution of language, rather than a mistake - as long as the meaning is still clearly understood. (Also i'm not particularly good at language in general - whether it be spelling, grammar or whatever - so this may be useful knowledge as to why I have such a view.. who knows). Hello, users of CMV!
