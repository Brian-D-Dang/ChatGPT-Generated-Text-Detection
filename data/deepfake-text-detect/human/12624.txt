"Let there be light," God said, and the Light was created. God saw, that the Light was good, but then he realized something. The Darkness had always been there. Being contrasted to the Light it stood out so much clearer, the one thing he didn't create. God was filled with anger, but mostly with fear, and he wanted to eliminate the Darkness. But then God realized, that just as the Light was making the Darkness stand out much clearer, so was the Darkness making the Light stand out much clearer, so he decided to let the Darkness be. But many of the angels were displeased with the Darkness, and the most displeased was Lucifer. He held a fiery speech to the angels, where he said, that the Darkness must be destroyed, and many angels followed him. But their attack on the Darkness was in vain. Then Lucifer decided to lead a rebellion against God to force him to eliminate the Darkness, after God had refused to listen to their pleas, and by far the most of the angels, who had followed him before, followed him once more, but they were defeated. Then Lucifer and the other rebel angels cursed God and the Darkness and they swore by the Light that they would eliminate the Darkness no matter what.
