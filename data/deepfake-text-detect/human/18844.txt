Famine, accelerating climate change, the increasing risk for the spread of communicable diseases, poverty, and political discontent are just a few of the issues that can be attributed to overpopulation. Rather than enacting laws that address these individually, we have a moral obligation to address the root cause. I hate to be vague on how this would be done. But, I would rather debate this theoretically than get bogged down in a policy discussion. Although, if you argument would be best served by referencing a specific policy (be it condom distribution or Chinese style family size restrictions) then be my guest. Edit: I know this is sloppy, but... Open for debate: that human overpopulation is the root cause of the issues listed above.
