..and in my opinion its kind of embarrassing to be a patriot or to be proud of your country as an average citizen in these countries. compared to most African and few Asian states we were not able to maintain only a few elements of our culture and most of our traditional values are only superficially held on to or even being abused. For example to show Mandela and his accomplishments respect southafricans have gathered in Johannesburg and sing traditional songs together celebrating that mandela lived, as for germany, where i am from the most traditional songs nowadays are written in sloppy German and deal with drinking and having sex with as many women as possible. Therefore most of us should be ashamed of themselves for being proud of a country that is that influencial in a corporate world and only economically successfull but leaving tradition and values (if there ever had been any) behind. CMV so that i can understand what people e.g. in germany are being proud of!
