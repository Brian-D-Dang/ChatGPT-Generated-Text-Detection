For more information on these types of games, please see: [MOBA definition] [Dota2] I've been captured by the intense enjoyability of playing video games for over 6 years. I've drained thousands by thousands of hours through the years on such different games. These games have huge replay value and I find true enjoyment when I'm playing them. The availability of so many different heroes and champions to play never makes these types of games boring, and I feel casually playing them is comfortable.
