Mark: 1,658,198,683,182 (4,539,999,926.6R) -Rain Forests: Dying, yet still alive. Rain will eventually succumb to acidic levels too high. Estimated time until pH of 0: 23,740.73 (65R). -Deserts: Still deserted save for appropriate wildlife. Continued pollution estimated to increase. Increasing heat will eventually lead to inability to sustain current wildlife. Estimated life span: 51,133.88 (140R). -Oceans: Vibrant. Subject to location. Life will sustain but not indefinitely. Large difference between surface and deep water. Life span of inhabitants will range broadly. Estimated species life span range: 10,957.26 (30R) - 292,193.6 (800R) (Note: Re-check in 3,652.42 (10R. -MountainsValleys: Remain lush, 43 untouched. Wildlife sustains natural order except near destroyers. Active volcanoes keep destroyers at bay in certain areas. Assign specific mountainous regions, both above and below sea level, to develop more magma and lava. No current estimation of life known. (Note: Re-check after adjustment, using VOLC formula). -Cold Climate Life: Remains in-tact and mostly untouched. Sometimes interfered with by oil reserves leaking due to destruction of precious land nearby. Despite this, no end in sight. (Note: If destruction increases within 1,826.21 (5R), re-check using OIL, WILD, and CLIM formulas). -Universal: Untouched save for footprints and sentient life. Destroyers do not have capabilities to radically alter state. Utilizing EGO formula, will never achieve influential exploration or colonization. Improbable statistics suggest ability utilizing TECH. Estimated chance of eliminating EGO formula:. Estimated chance of success utilizing TECH without EGO: 23.554 -Destroyers: Still unable to set up domiciles among poles, water, certain climates, and universe. Destruction continues without remorse. Inability to prevent self-destruction imminent with further development of destruction capabilities. Current coverage: 2.. Estimated maximum coverage utilizing TECH despite possible VOLC and CLIM interference: 34.770231 (Re-check in 10,957.26 (30R) utilizing new OIL formula). Estimated life span with current technology: 42,002.83 (115R) (factored in TECH and EGO formulas). Estimated life span if EGO eliminated as a factor: Indefinite due to TECH overhaul and unknowns. (Re-check in 36,524.2 (100R. Estimated maximum usage of Earth until destroyer-needed resources depleted: Unknown due to TECH factors (Re-check in 10,957.26 (30R. Assessment: Destroyers remaining unchecked continue to prove very dangerous for most life. Landscapes changing will mostly likely not be enough to slow destruction, even utilizing new VOLC formulas. Increase NAT-REC by a factor of 2.0442 over the next 1826.21 (5R). This will allow for more beauty created as winds, rain, and other natural adhesives keep the destroyers at bay. (Note: Continue assessment tomorrow in-depth, beginning to extrapolate on individual life starting with most intelligent (Delphinidae). Be sure to calculate when their intelligence capabilities could overtake destroyers and match that of distant ancestors. Check in with Delphinidae planet (Dolinus) to cross-check when intelligence level will be met in order to reduce destroyer numbers to appropriate levels.) Edit: Formatting.
