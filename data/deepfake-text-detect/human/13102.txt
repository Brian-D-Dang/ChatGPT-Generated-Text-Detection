Guess I'll start. The fans could feel their stomachs drop. The stadium was emitting a powerful wave of frustration. Nothing was going our way. This was not happening, I will not let this happen. Our country is supposed to be the pride of this sport. Not much time left, I've got to push my tired legs even harder. I've got to lead the boys with the red band on my arm. I can do this. Fuck yes. A foul. This is it. I place the ball in my spot like I've done the thousands of times on the training ground. I can't even feel my body, I'm not there. All we need is one goal to go through to the World Cup. I can do this. I close my eyes and take a deep breathe. I've done this thousands of times, just go through your motions. I ran up and curled the ball into the back of the net. No! Yes. Fuck. Shit. YES. Fucking did it. Bloody hell. The fans shot up in prideful jubilation. I ran my soul toward the fans and celebrated. Look at me. Look at me. I'm the captain now. Really not my story: https: vt0GESlaVNdE video inspired..... oh well.
