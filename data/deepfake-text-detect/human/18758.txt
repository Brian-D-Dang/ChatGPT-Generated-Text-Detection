There seems to be a lot of misinformation out there about what the "porn ban" actually is and I'm sick of being called ignorant for my viewpoint without any supporting information. I really want to hear the facts about why so many people think this tramples on our freedoms. There is one CMV about this, but I didn't feel it addressed I believe this opt in system tries to prevent children who are not searching for graphic content from accidentally stumbling across it. It doesn't do much for adults and young adults (since they'll know how to get around it or they'll just disable it). An opt in system is ideal, but not all parents care enough to monitor their children like they should (sad but true). If parents do care enough and feel that the bans are too widespread, they can opt out and create their own parental controls. It doesn't seem much different from the advertising controls on other media, except that there's even more freedom to see what you want. Graphic content isn't straight up banned. TL;DR - the opt in system is a great way to prevent young children from families that don't monitor or control internet usage from accidentally coming across graphic content.
