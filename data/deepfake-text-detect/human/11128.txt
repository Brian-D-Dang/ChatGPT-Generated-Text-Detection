It has been theorized that certain parts of our brain keep track of time. They are parts of the neocortex who control our sense of time. Not only cannibis, but many other drugs as well, interfere with the brain's functioning and affect the time-keeping parts. But cannibis does not strictly affect only these parts; it more globally affects the brain and these time-tracking parts get affected with it. I also think the hyper focus explanation makes sense though.,Cannabis is the richest known natural source of tachyons. Tachyons travel faster than light and interact directly with the time field, when you inhale the tachyon laden smoke they enter your blood stream and are carried to your brain, causing your brain to experience temporal distortion.
