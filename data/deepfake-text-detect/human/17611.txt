Consumer loyalty just seems to cause issues in the gaming market. People will buy things just because they are simply the next in the series.

If we look at the latest ones, ignoring the wiiu, they both have no backwards compatability, and both are moving away from dedicated machines. This even accounts for microtransactions, because they worked well in whichever game did them first, and then they spread like a virus to almost all iosandroid games, even those that had no right to use something like that, and even spread to pc games.
