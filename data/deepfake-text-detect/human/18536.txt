If there was a 'superman' or 'goku' or any person having special abilities comparable to that, Governments would be doing everything to control that being or stop them. Being that this person could most likely make the choice to not listen to government regulations, policies and international laws that the rest of the world abides by, would raise ire among those that are no longer the top of the food chain. In turn this would turn governments against each other and make threats of bringing violent acts against populations or other drastic situations to bring this person under some type of control. tl;dr - Governments would create total war to stop or capture this individual. Edit: This is all extremely hypothetical of course and assuming this person has human characteristics and is not from another solar system, planet or otherwise. Let's say 'x-meen' originsish?
