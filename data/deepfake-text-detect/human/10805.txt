Compared to moving things, eyes are kind of slow; they can't really see things that are moving really fast. It's like if you were to close your eyes, then only open them for a little bit, then close them again, but this is happening dozens of times a second. So the reason that wheels look like they're going backwards is based on when your eyes are looking. So, if you were to look at a clock that only had a second hand, and you closed your eyes for 59 seconds, and then close your eyes for 59 seconds again, and do that a lot, you might think that it wasn't a second hand but a minute hand, and that it was running backwards, because you saw it at 30, then at 29, then at 28, and so on. The stroboscopic effect is what happens when your eyes do exactly that, but at dozens of times per second.," "Hi. I answered this a few days ago. [Here's the link.] (URL0)
