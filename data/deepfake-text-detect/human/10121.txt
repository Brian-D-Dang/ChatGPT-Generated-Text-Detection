People talk about'natural' or'God-given rights', but all rights can be taken from you. If rights like "free speech" or "free association" are'inalienable','natural', or'God-given', how come so many people don't have them. "Rights" are created by the state, on their terms. I hear alot of people claiming "The right to free speech," or "The right to the pursuit of happiness." Looking at the world in these terms is false, misleading and detrimental to society. No rights are absolute- the world would be screwed if they were. Laws about inciting violence, truth in advertising, libel, slander, pornography, threats, extortion, racial vilification, sexual harassment, tax fraud and many, many more, all limit free speech, but are vital for society. Can I "pursue happiness" by running over the elderly in my F150, or selling crack to toddlers? But I got the "right"!! right? All'rights' have limits. Looking at things purely in terms of "rights" creates a selfish, narcissistic, entitled, unreasonable mindset. Rights and responsibilities are two sides of the same coin, but there's no "Bill of Responsibilities." Talking about'Rights' like this makes people think they can do what they want, coz "I got Rights!!." Rights are a myth, and we need a better model for thinking about personal freedom.
