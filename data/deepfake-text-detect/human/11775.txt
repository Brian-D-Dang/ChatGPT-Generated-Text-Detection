A new privacy feature in Firefox strips custom URL query parameters from URLs to prevent tracking. The Query Parameter Stripping feature automatically strips various query parameters from clicked links and links pasted into the address bar. It can be enabled by changing Enhanced Tracking Protection to'Strict' in Firefox Settings. Some sites may not work correctly with the feature turned on.
