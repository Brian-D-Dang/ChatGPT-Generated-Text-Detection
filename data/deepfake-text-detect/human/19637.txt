1) This separation of PvE and PvP gear makes it near impossible for players to enjoy both aspects of the game. A dedicated PvE raider is going to spend multiple hours a week preparing for the upcoming raids (via farming, etc), and then spend HUGE swaths of time actually raiding. The PvP stats become a mandate to play EVEN MORE so that you can actually experience the game you already pay for. 2) Often times the impact is much more extreme going from PvE - PvP and much less harsh going from PvP - PvE. By this I mean that a fully geared PvPer is going to be able to at the very least "play ball" in a PvE raid. But the same is basically untrue in reverse. 3) I anticipate players saying that the PvE player will have 0 experience with PvP and they do not deserve to have an advantage over someone who focus's on PvP. My response to that is "Isn't that what ELO is for?" These raiders have put in countless hours improving their character just to get crapped on via an arbitrary stat. Not because they arent good at it. 4) I feel that all characters should have their gear normalized to exactly the same stats while PvPing, or a new system needs to be created. Perhaps they could implement some LoL style game play, where you join a bg at "level 1" and as you progress through the game, you can unlock itemsbuffsstats. CMV. EDIT 1: I am obviously a PvE raider. But I really really would love to be mildly viable in PvP too. Cant we all have fun?! Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
