I've noticed that most people associate politically with others who share similar viewpoints and often react with hostility when introduced to ideas outside their comfort zone. This happens on both the right and left. Regardless of who one ismale or female, black or white, rich or poorif someone agrees with you, you'll welcome them and if someone disagrees with you, you'll reject them. Two examples illustrate my point: First, Clarence Thomas is a Supreme Court justice who happens to be the second black justice on the court in US history. Yet, because he is conservative, no liberal would think of having him as being the deciding vote on a Supreme Court case based on his perspective growing up poor in the segregated South. Second, George Soros is a wealthy financier. Because he supports liberal causes, he is never called out for being among the greedy one percent. If he were conservative, he'd be thrown in with the Koch brothers. What this means is that contrary to what many say is a strength, our diversity, is actually a hindrance insofar as we want our political views to be affirmed by like-minded travelers.
