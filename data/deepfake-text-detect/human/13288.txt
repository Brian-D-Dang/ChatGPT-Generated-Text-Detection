Dear Ciara. You know it's been 4 years since you told me that I'm ugly. It's been 2 and half of me loving myself more than anyone else. You know it's been 4 years since you told me that I don't have any friends. It's been 3 years of me being surrounded by friends. You know it's been 4 years since you told me that everyone would be better off. It's been 3 and a half years of me know that isn't true. You know, it's been 4 years since you told me to kill myself. It's been almost 4 years since I tried. I just thought you should know, that I'm finally mentally fine. Fuck you.
