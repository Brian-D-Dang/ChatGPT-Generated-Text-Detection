We went to visit my Uncle Albert's farm in rural Maine. My brothers and sisters went to play on the rope swing in the barn. They said I was to little to swing and to go back to Momma. I climbed under the porch to listen to Momma and Uncle talk. A feral momma cat with kittens attacked me and scratched my face.
