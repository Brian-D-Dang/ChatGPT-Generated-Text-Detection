Some days, I think I am dying. Other days, I hope I am. But I'm here. Unfortunately, I am still here. A shell of a human being. A painting of modest beauty but exquisite detail. Inside, however, lies a drawing soaked in black ink and torn to shreds. There's no beauty in such a world anymore. Just emptiness. Days upon days of gut wrentching emptiness and the sharp teeth of loneliness tearing away at your heels. Torment; noun 1. Severe physical or mental suffering And then you're presented with it. An escape. The smallest glint of light. You can practically feel the relief, the though of it making you happier than anything perhaps ever has. Your whole body tingles at the idea, fear and excitement clouding your desperate mind. If you had a cavity, you would want a dentist to remove it, would you not? It's been bothering you for weeks now, your teeth in more pain than they've ever been before. You can't eat you favorite things, you can't do any sports, you can hardly talk its so incredibly sore. The only thing on your mind is the pain. The constant never ending pain. How are you supposed to focus on anything with your jaw throbbing like this? It's impossible. But lucky you, there's a solution. A silver dentist with a loud booming voice, promising you to completely rid yourself of your nasty toothache. By god, you'll think, this has gone on too long. But is this going to hurt? "Not a bit," The dentist reassures you with his smoky breathe, extending his metal hand, "It's quick and easy, you wont feel a thing." "Yes sir, but what if I feel nothing at all?" "Than at least its better than what you felt before." I nod and give his rigid hand a hard tug.
