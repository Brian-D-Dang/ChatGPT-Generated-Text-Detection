So this is another [PRISM] CMV, but more specific than the [big thread] from two days ago, and not making any specifically normative claims about [privacy] in this CMV. I believe that saving lives trumps almost all other ethical obligations (except perhaps 'don't torture', 'don't rape' etc - crimes where we might feel death is preferable to being a victim). Certainly, saving lives trumps most other ethical obligations, and by this I mean that it is morally wrong not to save lives if you are able to and saving the lives involves only a small inconvenience to yourself. To reiterate this point; it is not merely that we think those who save lives are good people, but those who don't save lives are bad people (subject to the same exceptions I've already recognized). This obligation holds even if we are only discussing 'statistical' lives - if doing something relatively minor (like wearing a seatbelt in cars) can save the lives of other people in the unlikely event of a car crash then we are morally obligated to do it. Clearly, there is a line that must be drawn between the probability of a life being lost (and the severity of losing those lives) on the one hand and the inconvenience or ethical imposition of what prevents the deaths on the other. For example, although we know training every citizen as a fully qualified EMT would save lives, to do so would probably be too great an imposition for too small a benefit. It is my position that there is no possible information you could posses which could justify losing a life - even a statistical life - if kept secret. This is probably not true for information the state possesses (military secrets etc), but I think is almost certainly true for private citizens. There are obvious implications for the ethics of PRISM, but I only want the above V C'd - that you have such an obligation to release private information if doing so could prevent a tragedy.
