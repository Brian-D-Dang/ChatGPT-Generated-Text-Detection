Arrived 6:50 am pulled up to the express oil change, (fast lane) service mgr comes over to fill out ticket and asked me who my appt was with, when I told him I didnt have one he started being snippy, I never needed an appt before, ive been coming here 2-3x a yr for 3 yrs, so I go into the lobby to find it filthy and no coffe yet, whats going on here in fancy scottsdale? I think I need to find a new Dodge place!!
