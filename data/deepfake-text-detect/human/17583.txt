This is purely from anecdotal, self researched and experiential knowledge, so feel free to correct me if there are any glaring issues in my position. I believe that some of the social welfare programs in the United States could be reformed to give jobs, education, and training to low-to-none income individuals and families as opposed to handing out checks. I believe that this would be beneficial because: 1. Living off a free welfare check sometimes decreases an individual's drive to work and better themselves; and by extension to increase their standard of living 2. Providing job training andor an education to underprivileged individuals allows for the betterment of the individual - increasing ambition, social ability, financial stability, and other benefits 3. Providing job training andor an education to underprivileged individuals allows for the betterment of the society - increasing the education of American society as a whole, decreasing unemployment and crime rates 4. I believe that there is enough money (read: safety net programs budget in the US; ) that will be freed up in order to allow this reform "He certainly doesn't practise his precepts, but I suppose the patron meant that if you give a man a fish he is hungry again in an hour; if you teach him to catch a fish you do him a good turn."
