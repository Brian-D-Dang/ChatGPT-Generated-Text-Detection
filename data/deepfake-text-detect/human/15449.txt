Finally I got a chance to enjoy DTC picnic basket meal. My order was a meat 3 - fried chicken 3 sides (Mashed potatoes n gravy, hushpuppies and cornbread) Note: In the summertime the wait is hella long, my 45 minute wait became an hour wait, patience chile should be your mantra! The fried chicken, though good, was not crispy enough for my liking, it lacked the crunchiness I crave. However, my 3 sides were the showstoppers! Hushpuppies with the sauce is amazing. I am guessing they are dipped in chickpea flour batter. The cornbread was warm and went well with the gravy.The gravy here is a nice peppery kind with the right amount of thickness and consistency. I wish there were more places like this which have a picnic basket option.
