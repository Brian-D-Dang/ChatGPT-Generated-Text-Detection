I'm not saying that all women are inferior to any man. I'm saying that I think that statistically, picked any woman and any man, the chance of having the man more intelligent strong capable than the woman is more than 50 (maybe 55-60 ? This is not actual data, I'm trying to give you an insight on my view), and whenever people say that we're equal I instantly think .."Well no, not actually." I know this sounds sexist, but I never actually talked to a woman who expressed a good point in an argument, while men are usually more open minded and know their facts more. Someone please change my view, this sounds so bad. EDIT: Most of you said that my argument depends on what I consider important. This is true, so I'll try to be more specific. Are women worse than men at arguing? I talk about explaining a point, finding logical fallacies and another point of view, discovering new facts about science, physics or math. I hope my point of view is distorted, because that's what I consider important. I don't care if you're awesome at throwing a ball, running, dancing, whatever. Physics, science and math really matter to me. I have a feeling that everyone knows what I'm talking about, and we just pretend this isn't true to avoid arguing.
