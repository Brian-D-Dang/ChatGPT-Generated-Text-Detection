I don't have an incredibly detailed post on the matter. My general logic is if you HAVE to sign someone up to vote, they will most likely be too lazy to take the time to read up on their candidates or what they're voting for. I believe everybody should have the right to vote and access to voting, but when you're cajoling people into registering you're adding fluff votes based on color, party, or sensationalized issues. I feel like most people I've brought this up with believe I'm wrong so I just want a well constructed argument as to why. Not here to argue at all, thanks for your time! Hello, users of CMV!
