As someone who studies game design, philosophy, and literature, I can't see how anyone could possibly be impressed with The Stanley Parable. The game uses a very low-depth decision tree (think Goosebumps choose your own adventure story for children) where players make arbitrary choices about which direction in a hallway to travel towards. The only context for the decision is given my a narrator. The game has nothing novel or even interesting to say about narratives or truth. Everyone knows that video games offer limited sets of choices. The point is that they still allow for infinite means of expression. It's like someone comes up to you and says, "Have you ever thought about how writing is just letters put together in a certain order?" But instead of being directed to a book or class on the philosophy of language, everyone lifted this person up and proclaimed them a deep thinker of the highest order. It truly distresses me because many great works in gaming are overlooked. And today, the marketplace (from indie to AAA games) is filled to the brim with shallow ideas. The only reason I can think of for praising the Stanley Parable is to make the slurge of games in the modern market seem less revolting.
