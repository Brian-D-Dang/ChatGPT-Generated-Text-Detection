First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue from an objective point of view. This post was inspired by a question I posted to rlegaladvice and was told that it's a douche move. I didn't feel it was appropriate to discuss the douchiness of it there so I decided to make this post. You go into a parking lot and are trying to find a place to park. There's one 15 spots away from the door and then there's one that's 3 spots away from the door. One of them is meant for expectant mothers but there is no punishment for parking there if you are not an expectant mother which makes the two spots equivalent in everything expect for distance from the door. Objectively, it's better to choose the closer one. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
