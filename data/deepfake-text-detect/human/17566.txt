Development always seems to be about bringing the living conditions of people outside of the first world in line with the things we enjoy in the first world. This does not seem like a very sympathetic cause to me for a number of reasons: firstly, it relies on an assumption that a comfortable lifestyle as enjoyed in the west is something that deserves to be extended across the world; secondly, it relies on an assumption that struggling populations will be happy to receive our help. Both of these objections can be de-constructed further. An assumption that first world lifestyles are better than any other seems to me to be objectionable because it is not settled that it is better to live in comfortable surroundings than those which require the maintenance of strength and resilience. Similarly, it is not settled that it is undesirable that each person should deal with his own problems without assistance, thereby cultivating strength and improving the accuracy of his targeted solutions. An assumption of the primacy of a first world lifestyle may also give rise accidentally to, (or, be used deliberately to condone,) the replacement of indigenous cultures with the values of the entity which is providing the development (eg - the west). The second assumption - that struggling populations will be happy to receive our help - seems dubious for a couple of reasons: these populations may be unwilling to be helped by others and would wish to enact improvements independently; and even if these populations would encourage assistance to improve their living conditions, said populations may be unreceptive to the idea of assistance coming from countries which could be seen as benefitting from the world order which entails their own subjugation.
