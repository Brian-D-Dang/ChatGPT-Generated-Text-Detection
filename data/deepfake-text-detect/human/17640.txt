There are artists such as The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and Muse, for instance, which I don't particularly lust over. I am not huge of fans of these bands. I however, COMPLETELY understand why they are adored, and revered, and I do genuinely think they are tremendously talented. When it comes to music, David Bowie is the only that has "GOD" status, and I just, don't, get it. He has a gazillion albumswhich, leads me to believe I may be correct; no one is that prolific. BUT, BUT... I am open to changing my mind. What are the absolute top go-to Bowie songs that I should hear, that would possibly change my mind.
