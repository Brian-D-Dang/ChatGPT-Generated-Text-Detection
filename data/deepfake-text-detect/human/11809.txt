Google has come under fire again with the revelation that its Nest Secure product had a built-in microphone. The microphone has existed in the product since launch but was never listed in the product specifications. Google has apologized for the oversight, saying that they had made a mistake in not announcing the existence of the built-in microphone. It claims the microphone was built into the device for future updates, such as the current Assistant upgrade, and for the possibility of integrating other security features such as detecting broken glass.
