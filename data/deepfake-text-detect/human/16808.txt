We analyze the adversarial examples problem in terms of a model's fault tolerance with respect to its input. Whereas previous work focuses on arbitrarily strict threat models, i.e., -perturbations, we consider arbitrary valid inputs and propose an information-based characteristic for evaluating tolerance to diverse input faults. 1 footnote 1 1 footnote 1 Source available at
