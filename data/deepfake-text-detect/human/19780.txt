To clarify I'm talking about the health issues that Marijuana can cause. Such as lung issues, immune system issues, the addictive properties of the drug, brain damage etc. The reason is because Alcohol is bad for you, cigarettes are bad for you, but neither of these things have the "its bad for you" reasoning behind them, so why should Marijuana. With Alcohol, the US did the whole making it illegal thing, and no one was happy about it so it looked nice on paper, but realistically it doesn't work. With cigarettes, I'm pretty sure the tobacco companies are going to do everything in their power to keep cigarettes legal. So right there we have 2 instances where substances are bad for you, but it doesn't really matter. So I think the same should be said for Marijuana. If people are going to make bad decisions, let them feel the consequences.
