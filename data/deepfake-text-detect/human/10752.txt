The reasoning behind it is, for the most part, to prevent honest people from being made homeless because of dishonest landlordsowners. In theory, you could get a gullible person to pay rent without a lease, and the moment the cash is in hand, the landlord calls the cops and gets them hauled out. Without a paper trail saying that they were truly tenants and paid rent, there's nothing stopping this from happening. Honest people are now homeless and without the money they paid because they were taken advantage of. So instead of dragging them out by the ankles, the cops leave it to the courts to decide who is actually in the right, and then act accordingly. It's not a perfect system, and people certainly take advantage, but not as many as you would think. There's a reason these stories are newsworthy, they're the exception. It's also not true that you can't do anything about it, you can. You just have to file with the courts to get them removed. It's inconvenient and you're unlikely to get your filing fee back as they're probably just going to disappear, but it works. TL;DR - The justice system would rather have an honest property owner be inconvenienced than for an honest tenant to be homeless because they were taken advantage of.,You can evict them of course, but usually they just sneak in when nobody is there, in the middle of the night for example. And sometimes it is even legal and the squater has actual legal right, saying that you cant just evict them yourself, but first have to go to court.
