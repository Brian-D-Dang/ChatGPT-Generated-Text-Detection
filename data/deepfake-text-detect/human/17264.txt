Chances are the reason you feel upset is not the worker's fault, it's the company's. They're not your friends, they only want your money, and they'll do anything to get it. Customer service workers are useful as shields to the backlash that will likely come from what businesses tend to do to bleed more out of you. Try writing a letter to the CEO (ie, customer service) instead saying how much you hate a certain policy. They'll then waive the policy just for you until the next time you complain about it because you're not a big enough threat to get them to change anything. Just take your business someplace else, it's the only thing you can do that'll make any kind of difference, depending on how much you're worth. (hint: chances are it's nowhere near enough to make a significant dent in their profits) As for the workers themselves, attempt to understand why a person may not be throwing themselves at your feet every time you enter their establishment. If you've never worked customer service then your faith in humanity must still be intact. Ours however is lowered significantly the longer we work in customer service. You know what I used to do whenever a customer would start to yell at me? I'd just watch them freak out until they either stopped or left, just like when a child throws a tantrum. (or I'd tell them to GTFO and never come back, but that was a liquor store where it's fine) In the end though it all comes back to the above paragraph, you're not powerful enough to make any kind of changes to how a company does business and thus all you can do is shop someplace else. CMV EDIT: Thanks everyone for your replies. I used the wrong wording for this post for sure, not everyone who yells at a customer service employee is an idiot. They're assholes, irrational, just having a bad day, or they want something for free. Idiot doesn't fall into any of those categories, so my apologies.
