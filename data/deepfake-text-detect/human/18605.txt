While I strongly disagree with the Muslim Brotherhood and their policies they did win a fair election in Egypt. Many islamists have been skeptical of democracy and by overthrowing one of the only elected muslim governments we have shown that the west only supports democracy when it favors us. I know that it would anger our allies in the region by doing this, but I don't think that matters because they need the US far more than the US needs them. Extending an olive branch to the islamists in Egypt and showing them that we support the peoples choices, not just the choices of the people who we agree with, would be extremely beneficial to the US. If we look at what is happening from the perspective of a brotherhood supporter they don't have a choice but to try and have a government like Iran's. One that doesn't have democracy and follows a truly authoritative role. They will become Taliban and al qaeda sympathizers. What could be a strong ally group in the region will instead be our enemies. We are forcing them into a position of hating us. Because when they played our game and won the rules were then ignored. Currently the Egyptian government is reporting the deaths of their police officers and calling it massacres, but this is an understandable retaliation considering that these same police are massacring innocent unarmed protesters in far greater numbers. Now I know that the Brotherhoods rule was far from a perfect democracy. But the economic turmoil wasn't the brotherhoods fault, they inherited a country that had just gone under revolution during one of the worst global recessions. Of course there were major problems. And while Morsi ignored the minority he could have easily been thrown out during the next election. The Muslim Brotherhood didn't actually have a majority support but simply won based on the fact the opposition couldn't form a coalition like they could during the next election.
