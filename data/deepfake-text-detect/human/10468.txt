Problem: Our current planet is trending towards getting worse and worse due to climate change reducing livable and farm-able areas. NASA: Hey guys, how about you give us some more funding after all the cuts. I mean, you don't have to spend so much money on killing people! US Government: Maybe. SpaceX and other private companies: Look! The private sector can also fund space exploration! Rich people can pay to go to space! US Government: That's cool. We don't want to spend our money doing that for you though. Russia: We're too busy dealing with land grabs on Earth. Other countries (India, China, etc.): We can be as cool as the US and Russia in space exploration too! This makes us at their level, right? TV Media: We can't believe people enjoyed a science show like Cosmos. Maybe we should focus more on space. Video Game Media: People are tired of modern combat games. They want space games (Kerbal Space Program, Star Citizen, Elite: Dangerous)! General public: Well, the recession is behind us (sorta, kinda, not really), so let's focus on the possible future (to ignore our current situation)!
