Well, some beaches have no end, they go around the entire coastline. Other time a beach will end in a cliff, or other obstruction. Sometimes they grow more and more rocky until it's no longer just a rocky beach, but more of a rocky coastline. And sometimes there is a forest that reaches right out to the water.,Well generally a beach is like a small bay, with a cliff at the ends determining where it is not considered a beach anymore. [Like here] (URL0) The sand bit you would definately call a beach, but where it turns to sheer vertical cliff you would no longer call a beach. Some beaches are longer, some could wrap the entire edge of an island. Sometimes if one big beach has a small cliff jutting out in the middle that stops access via land then it will be considered 2 beaches when they are only seperated by a small wall.
