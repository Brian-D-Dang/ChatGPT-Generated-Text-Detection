It is a well known fact that here in America, the Democratic Party is largely supported by the lower class. The reason for this is that the Democratic Party tends to favor government handouts for these types of people. My opinion is that if Democrats are allowed to do this for the poor, then they should have to so something for those of us who are better off. If it continues in this manner, it would seem as though the Democratic Party is bribing the lower class into voting for them. In order to show that these claims are not true, I believe it would be best for them to show some type of support (ammunition, farmland, etc.) for the rest of us Americans. Change my view!
