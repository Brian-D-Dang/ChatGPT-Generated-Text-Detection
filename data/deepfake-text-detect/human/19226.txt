Let's change this up a little, from the usually religiouspolitical discussions, shall we?:) Okay, so this has bugged me ever since I finished reading Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, just a couple of days after it was released. Severus Snape was always this character that you were really unsure of where his loyalties were. There was a lot of depth there, and evidence pointing to both him being on the "light" side and the "dark." However, whether he was with the good guys or not, I think we can all agree that he was a pretty crappy human being. He employed child abuse in his classroom daily without any repercussions. He held an awful grudge against Harry because of who his father was, and was completely crappy to him for the entire time he was going to school. I hear a lot of people saying that Snape is their favorite character in the series, and when asked why that is, it usually comes down to "because he was in love with Lily." ... like, seriously? This guy got friend-zoned, and then he never got over it. Then the girl gets killed by the guys he hero-worships. Yeah, it really, really sucks for him. But it in no way justifies any of the bad stuff he did. I loved the twist of Snape being on the good side. That was awesome. But I don't think that that makes Snape a "good guy." And I hate how the author and other characters in the book treated Severus Snape as some amazing guy who was just misunderstood the entire time, and that makes all the bad things he did okay. I love a good fandom rant, don't you?:) So, come on, Reddit. CMV.
