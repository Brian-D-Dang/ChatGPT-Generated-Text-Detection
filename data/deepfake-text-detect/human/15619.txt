We bypassed the wait by grabbing seats at the bar. Great beer selection, we went with a pitcher of fat tire which was new to us East Coasters. Delicious burgers, huge and juicy. We also had the deep fried pickles which were surprisingly tasty. Overall it was a great place to sit, grab a burger and relax.
