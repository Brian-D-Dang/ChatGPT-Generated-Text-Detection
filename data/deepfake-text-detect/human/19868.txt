As an atheist who believes in that the science is the only way to explain the questions regarding the origins of everything from the universe and all it contains, teaching children 'stories' written and edited only 2000 years ago (as most major religions have their origins) can explain everything with no empirical evidence at all and that if they do not believe these stories they shall be punished is bordering child abuse. In my eyes its the same as bringing up a child teaching them that Harry Potter is a historical text and not fiction. That child's view of the real world and everything it contains is being severely warped from an early age unfairly. To give no choice to a child or even present any other alternative to the parent own beliefs, imo, should be a crime as it deprives them of both choice and, again imo, the truth. I see it as intentionally emparting life rules which were made up and disadvantage the child for life. I don't have a problem with religion in general, it does a lot of good for a lot of people and can help people through life, especially when things are going badly for them. Plus I very much believe in 'each to their own' but that should not effect young children. It's just the issue of raising children in that environment and giving them no other option believe is wrong and in borderline criminal. My apologies for any grammatical or spelling errors, im dyslexic so probably missed a few ha. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
