I really don't understand the whole trans thing. I mean I have had exposure, I've met parents friends who've been post-op in my childhood, I had a friend who was in transition in university and knowing them doesn't change how I feel about it. They were all lovely people I got on fine with and great human beings and the fact they had this issue doesn't effect how I feel about or relate to them, but likewise the fact I got on with them doesn't change how I feel about this issue. I hate lots of things about my body, some of which I can change, some of which I can't. So a trans person hates their sex organs, they want the sex organs of the opposite sex. They want it so badly they think they ought to be the opposite sex, that they actually are it or whatever. But... they have got the sex organs they've got, they've got the chromasomes they've got. It doesn't mean they need to act in a particular way if they don't want to - but that's what they've got. Even now, I feel this is clearly pathological - the inability to accept their actual body that they were born with to a degree they want to mutilate it. I just cannot get my head around the idea that that is something that we should be as a society encouraging. I feel like people should accept what life gives them, learn to live and cope with it, not undergo dangerous surgery and disruptive hormone treatments over their inability to accept themselves. If I had a child who wanted to have that kind of surgery I would openly disapprove. If they did it anyway I'd still support and love them of course, but I would think they made the wrong choice and that they were rejecting a part of themselves and it would make me feel sad.
