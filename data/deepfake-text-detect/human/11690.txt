Starship, SpaceX's next-generation rocket, partially burst apart during ground tests in Texas. SpaceX was conducting some pressure tests with the vehicle. The explosions were not completely unexpected, according to SpaceX. There were no injuries and the incident is not a serious setback for the Starship project. Starship will transport cargo and people to deep space destinations like the Moon and Mars. Elon Musk planned to test the vehicle in low altitudes within the next couple of months. A new prototype of the vehicle has been planned that has a different flight design to the prototype that burst.
