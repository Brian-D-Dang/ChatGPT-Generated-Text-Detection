Some of the worst, over priced, bland food I have ever had in my life! Garlic bread they brought to the table had no flavor and was cold. Wouldn't give it to my dogs. The salad was composed of the cheapest lettuce known to man...with 2 or 3 good pieces of lettuce thrown in there. Insulting basically. Then the pasta comes. Meat sauce was watery with very few pieces of meat. Beers were over priced. Tables were so close together that my boyfriends chair got hit every time a waiter walked by. Once the 60 year crowd stops coming, this place will hopefully go out of business. Ugh!!!! I want my 50 bucks back
