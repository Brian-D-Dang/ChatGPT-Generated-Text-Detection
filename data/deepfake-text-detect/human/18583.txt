I'll just start off with this: I may be biased because I'm sixteen. Hear me out, though. I took my first year of chemistry last year and it was the most stressful class I have ever taken. I didn't understand a thing and, no matter how many times it was explained to me, I was still clueless. I cannot think of a single moment in my life where someone will ask me to convert moles of oxygen into grams. I cannot think of a time when any of this will become useful to me. I don't plan on being a chemist, nor do I plan on becoming a mathematician. My strengths lie in literature and English. I also believe that making students participate in things they do not understand, nor have no interest in ever understanding, is harmful to the self-esteem of students, for this was the first year of my life I have ever truly questioned my intelligence. I remember my teacher's disappointment as he handed back my tests, and feeling as if I had not only failed him, but the school and myself. Chemistry has stressed me out to the point where just looking at the assignment made me have an anxiety attack, and if what the older classes are saying is true, I can't even imagine what physics will do to damage me next year. I believe that the only students who should have to take chemistry and physics are the ones who are interested in it and will most likely excel in it. School is no longer fun for me, and I believe I'd enjoy it much more if I participated in subjects I could understand. Change my view and, if possible, help me understand chemistry and physics.
