With several recent threads on the topic of voting, I thought I'd give my view that seems a bit contrarian here. What I believe is very simple and does not need much of an explanation: People should possess a certain knowledge on the topic of civics, and be able to meet a moderate standard of intelligence via testing before given the ability to vote. The test would be akin to a GED, which doesn't sound like much, yet it still has around a [40 failure rate] , and the high school equivalent of civics. The reading material would be supplied for free online, and free, via textbooks through state and local governments working with local libraries. I'd like to stress that specifics of coursework and distribution are not what is most important to me and is not what I'm very interested in discussingit would be difficult to change my view regarding trivial details of distributing the educational materialbut the discussion should revolve around the philosophical and moral points of the topic at hand.
