You know how it is, the man is always expected to pay for the women in whatever it is (movie, dinner, etc.) and if the man doesn't, the woman (usually) will look down upon him. I don't believe nowadays that is how it should be. It used to be the case where the man is the only one who made the money and had jobs so thats how and why it was accepted. But now women work as equally as men do and women still expect men to pay for them when they go out. I'm not against doing favors for each other, maybe the man pays for her once and next time the girl pays. But why is it always the man paying? I believe its an unacceptable double standard in today's age. What's wrong with splitting the bill down the middle? Edit Typo
