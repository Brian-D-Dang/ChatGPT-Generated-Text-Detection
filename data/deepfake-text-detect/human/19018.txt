Fairly simple cmv, I find myself lying to companies and services on an almost daily basis as it means I usually get better more for my money. The habit begun when I became disabled, I quickly realised that if i mentioned it I would usually receive priority service. This has expanded to all manner of small lies about myself and situation. I will often then follow up with a letter of thanks and a box of doughnuts, naming any staff that helped me, often leading to preferential treatment in the future. Why should I stop?
