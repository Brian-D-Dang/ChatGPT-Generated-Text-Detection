Businesses are on politicians nor should they be. I think it should be illegal to form any sort of political stance as a corporation. In a situation where Chik-Fil-A releases a public statement that they are against gay marriage should be illegal and should be punishable with a fine (granted they lost business by doing so.) Same with Poppa Johns. While, a CEO, or the like, is absolutely granted the right to have hisher own opinion on certain matters, they should remain private and the staff members and consumers should not face any sort of repercussions for that.
