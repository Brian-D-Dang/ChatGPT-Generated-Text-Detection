Airbnb Online Experiences now offers remote activities, such as bartending and cooking classes, virtual bike tours, drawing lessons, and more. Experiences launched in 2016 as part of Airbnb's plan to transform the rental platform into a full-fledged travel company. With most nonessential businesses being closed, Airbnb hopes that the online-only relaunch might give guests something to do and potentially give local hosts a new source of income. Experiences range from a few dollars up to 65 per person per activity. Airbnb has partnered with a few organizations to offer free live activities catered towards the elderly. These activities will be hosted on Zoom, with Airbnb providing the hosts paid access for free. Science
