Tardigrades are microscopic extremophiles that can survive exposure to intense temperatures, pressures, and even the vacuum of space. A group of scientists recently recorded high-speed videos of the animals traversing gel substrates. Tardigrades walk similarly to insects 500,000 times their size, suggesting that their gaits have either convergently evolved or that there was an early-branching ancestor that passed on the pattern. The way these animals walk could inspire future engineering concepts. A short clip showing a tardigrade walking is available in the article.
