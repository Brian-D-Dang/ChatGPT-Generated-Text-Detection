They don't block HBO Go, they just refuse to authenticate HBO subscriptions in order for their customers with HBO to access HBO Go. To get HBO Go, you must show HBO Go that you are subscribed to HBO through your cable provider. Comcast has never participated in allowing HBO Go through your cable subscription. You can however access HBO Go through your Comcast Internet, using the authentication of someone using another cable provider. For example: Your friend with HBO through AT amp;T cable can come over to your house with your Comcast Internet service, log into their HBO Go account on your PS4 and stream HBO Go just fine. TL:DR: They aren't blocking HBO Go through your PS4. They're blocking you from using your cable service subscription to access HBO Go. (Edit: This was the case as of a year or two ago, when I had HBO with Comcast. I just looked at the drop down list of cable providers on HBO Go, and I see that Comcast Xfinity is now an option. It wasn't when I tried back then. My comment may be wrong now.)," "It's their service you're using, they can do whatever you agreed to in your contract.
