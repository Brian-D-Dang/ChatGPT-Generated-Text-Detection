...well for the most part I do. Let me clarify: Hate speech based on biological factors should be banned. That includes but it is not limited to: - Racism - Sexism - Homophobia (or any sexual orientation for that matter) - Transphobia - Ableism People should be free to speak however they please, outside of speech advocating any of the above or any other types of exclusionary, oppressive speech. I know that it is impossible to enforce such a thing, and in private life it will inevitably be done, however in public life it should be banned and its ban enforced as a variation of a hate crime, inciting violence, what have you. While it is not the same as committing assault and battery while being motivated by hatred of [insert characteristic here], it causes psychological harm and can even incite violence. It is exclusionary based not on personal choices but on the biological lottery. Exclusionary practices are detrimental to a fully-functioning society, and as such they have no place in society. I'm sure plenty of you are thinking about the effects of a slippery slope, but I don't believe in that argument, as the rationale behind banning such speech cannot apply to other forms of speech. These are not just any political stances but inherently exclusionary ones. Change my view. EDIT: A clarification - this would not apply to the internet, or previously existing material, etc. This is a ban on public, intentional hate speech and the use of words to describe things as bad in a way that is exclusionary that's so gay" and the like).
