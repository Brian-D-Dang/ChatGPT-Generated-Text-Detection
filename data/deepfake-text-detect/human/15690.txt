I love this restaurant! Just wondering if my connections in Charlotte will allow myself sometime to eat here, breakfast, lunch or dinner, great wine and great price! Charming decoration and perfect service. What else would you expect in a restaurant? Ah, food! Deliciousness in detail! My faves: croissant with omelet for the morning, ceviche and the little fondue for lunch and dinner. Awesome salads!
