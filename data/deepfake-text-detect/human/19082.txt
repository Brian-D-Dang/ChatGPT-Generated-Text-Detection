This is a quandary of logic that I discovered a while back. Put simply the idea is put forward that any religion that calls for the sharing with and converting of others not in your religion means that your deity unfairly punishes certain people. While this is primarily targeted at Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, it can apply to any religion where humans are judged and then receive an eternal rewardpunishment. When you have a religion that calls for a "spreading of the gospel," to use the Christian term, you have a deity that has whether or not you're a member of his church in his list of qualifications for getting your eternal reward. Most religions explain that it is necessary (or even mandatory) for receiving the reward. This is when I would ask what about people that never knew your religion? My usual example is people that lived in either Ancient Egypt, Greece, or other prehistoric societies, or native populations that live far remote from your church. Most explain these as either "They get a free pass" or "They never knew My Deity, so they receive eternal punishment." This leads me to say this: Either you have a deity that is willing to punish whole civilizations that never got a chance to view "the truth," or one that let's anyone in who never had to make a choice. If it's the first, why would you want to worship someone like that? If it is the latter, why tell anyone if ignorance is a free pass? TL;DR: Either you have a massively unfair deity, or one that you wouldn't want to share the religion about. CMV Edit: Reposted because my last was removed due to the typo "CMW"
