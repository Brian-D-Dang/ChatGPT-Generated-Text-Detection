Although I'm conflicted about all aspects of Justice, Inc., I would be happy to see [this kid] rot in a cell for decades. Making examples of people like this is the only deterrent I can think of for btards who think terrorizing people, risking lives, and draining public resources for no reason is harmless and hilarious. It's hard for me to feel much sympathy when their btard lives are permanently ruined, since they're practically never held accountable. Am I being a dick about this? Are you sure?
