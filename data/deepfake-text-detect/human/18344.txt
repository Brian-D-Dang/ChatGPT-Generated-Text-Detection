First off, no I am not suicidal. Please think of this as a philosophy, rather then any depression, related situation. I believe that if you take the sum of the average person of Earths life most of their experiences would be negative. I believe this is mostly due to human nature, as humans, like any other animal, are competitive and will try and set each other back whenever possible, so as to appear dominate in a situation, become more appealing to the opposite sex and pass on their genes. I believe there are a great number of compassionate acts a person can and will do in there lifetime but for the most part these are outweighed by selfish acts one will do to advance their own circumstance. Thus, I believe, it is human nature to make things harder for other humans. Couple with that the possibilities for sadness, such as death of loved ones, famine, war, disease, etc that people suffer and this increases the negativity of living. Finally, add to this the omnipresent comparisons to an unobtainable perfect life the media pushes on the populace and you have a global population who are continuously reminded of their shortcomings. These are three main reasons I believe that, ultimately, existence is preferable to existence. Please Change My View!
