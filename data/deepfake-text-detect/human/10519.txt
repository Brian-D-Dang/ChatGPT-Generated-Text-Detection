There are a number of reasons all working together. The cynical (but not entirely incorrect) view is that defense contractors lobby government, government spends more on defense, defense contractors get paid. This happens, no doubt, but it's not the full picture. Within the US, there are a lot of military bases. They served a useful purpose at one point, but aren't really necessary now. However, they still provide a large part of the economy of many of the towns they occupy. If they closed, some of them would crumble like an Appalachian coal town. Representatives aren't likely to advocate something that puts a few thousand constituents out of work. There's also a popular foreign policy argument too. There are a lot of countries out there with a lot of weapons and the argument goes that if the US pulled out of everywhere, they would be more inclined to use them. What would happen to the south China sea or eastern Europe or Korea if the US wasn't around to help keep the peace? Maybe we would be better off, but many people think that sectarian violence and imperialism would grow, innocent civilians would get hurt, and the stability of the global economy would be greatly harmed. In the same vein, there's a human rights argument. If there is a genocide somewhere in the world, should those with the means intervene? Many say yes, and a global military presence helps the US be able to do that.,The US has vast foreign interests that make a large military a decent investment. Because the US has so much at stake if international "things" go bad, it employs the military as sort of like a global police force. If you start doing things that make the US or its allies mad, it's a safe bet there's an aircraft carrier not too far away. Historically speaking, it's pretty common for superpowers. Back when the British Empire was all the rage, England had ships in nearly every port to make sure nothing stopped the flow of trade. Likewise with the Roman Empire on the Mediterranean.
