I dont have extensive knowledge of Islam and I hope this is not true (hence posting in CMV). However, from what I understand, the prophet Muhammad was a violent war lord who had numerous child brides, the Qur'an preaches Jihad, and Sharia law promotes violence and intolerance. I believe most Muslims are peaceful good people but are so out of goodness of their hearts and not because they are following Islamic principles. Like many religious people it's easier to pick and choose the sections that preach things that they want to be true instead of the entirety of the text which is largely violent and amoral. Edit: Wow so many of you are finding ways to side step the point. 1. I dont care if politics is the driving force of the violence the fact is it's not hard to go directly to the source (Qur'an, Muhammad) to justify it. Not saying the vast majority do but tell me how the religion is not inherently violent. 2. No. Just because it was acceptable at the time doesnt make it acceptable for the messenger of your God. Representatives of God are held up to different standards than George Washington. 3. Saying that "well all religions can be interpreted as violent" or "you can interpret it anyway you want" doesnt work either because I'm not debating how it can be interpreted, I'm debating how it is most easily and rationally interpreted. You dont get to decide what you want to believe and then try to apply it to your religion. It's suppose to work the other way around.
