(I did this more from the view of the worshiper instead of the god..... whoops) You gaze at Them in wonder Wonderful Them from whom you came Who gave you life You love Them You do not understand Them But they understand You When your belly aches They feed you from their own flesh When you tire They rock you to sleep in their gentle arms When you cry out in pain They sooth it away with a gentle hand When you are scared They are there. You are never alone now You stare at them in wonder You thinks, maybe this time, they'll understand And you say their name They smile at your attempt And kiss you forehead And you bask in Their warmth Theresa smiled as she rocked her newborn baby back and forth in her arms, wondering what must be going on in her little mind.
