EDIT: This discussion has turned into a series of arguments over definition and semantics, rather than the core issue which is that I still believe that anyone who is reasonably certain that God exists (or doesn't) is being unreasonable. I think I'll more carefully plan my title for my next CMV, but for now I'm shutting this one down, because most people remaining just want to argue and be sarcastic and that does the opposite of changing my view. I am an Agnostic Theist, I don't really know whether there is a god or not. I lean toward believing that there is. I acknowledge evolution, and I don't think it is a crime for women to smile or drive a car. While it is easy to disprove many aspects of the bible and other religious texts, I believe it is impossible with our current limited understanding of the universe to make a valid assertion that there is or isn't any creator. I find the constant bickering on both sides of the issue, and the people involved to be obnoxious.
