I'm an 18 year old college freshman who's starting in a community college for a multitude of reasons. I've really not been able to get my friends that go away and say "whatever college is my dream school! name of college is amazing!," or rather something like "Proud to be a school name!" I'm going to be ending up at Michigan State after a year, which is a pretty popular school in my state. I'm mainly going since it has a good engineering program I'm interested in, and my buddy is there. I feel no need to say "I'm going to be a future Spartan!" or in no way see myself saying anything like that in the future. I think "college nationalism" can be pretty stupid sometimes, and I get that some people consider their best years of their life to occur in college, but I think it's more reasonable to say "Man, I really enjoyed my college years" compared to "Man, I loved being a school name." It really doesn't help that my Facebook feed is flooded by people moving into their new dorms and whatnot, which has sort of fed my opinion that "college nationalism" is stupid. So yeah. I'm open to someone changing my view. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
