While the knockout game is something that I do believe happens and has happened for many years, in neighborhoods stricken with poverty, there seems to be extreme (out of nowhere) media attention to this particular string of attacks. In a short time we've heard of attacks increasing in frequency and since then, there has been a lot of debate as to whether or not the targets of these crime are non white because the attackers are racist. I personally don't believe it. I think these criminals are violent idiots who are choosing the most vulnerable victims. Victims that unfortunately are various races. Just to be clear I am outraged over such these heinous actions and I do believe these criminals should be convicted of the crimes they commit. This however is not a hate crime and allowing the media to stoke fear against a certain group of people is dangerous.
