A guy in a wheelchair is not "differently-abled." He didn't give up his ability to walk in exchange for being a master of calculus or having the capacity to shoot fire out of his fingers. He is less-abled. He can do at least one less thing than everyone else, and gained nothing to make the tradeoff even. Similarly, nobody is "handi-capable." If you are blind, you are not more capable or just as capable as someone else. You can't see. There's no getting around that. You receive no benefits from your blindness aside from those given to you out of pity or obligation. Fix me. I feel like this is wrong, but at the same time the conviction is firmly-rooted.
