Amazon has placed an order for 1,000 autonomous driving systems from Plus, a startup founded in 2016. Plus is set to go public soon with a valuation of 3.3 billion. Amazon has the right to purchase up to 20 percent of Plus as part of the deal. Plus only manufactures self-driving systems, so Amazon will still have to develop its own trucks. Using autonomous vehicles to replace human drivers is expected for Amazon as the company has been replacing human labor with automation in various forms for years.
