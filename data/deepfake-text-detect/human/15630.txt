This is a really cool new place. My wife, 4 yr old daughter along with two friends hit it up this morning after charity walk at Fremont St. We were seated immediately, brought our drinks and promptly ordered. All five of us ordered something different, and everything was fantastic. I had the Chili Omlette, it was great. Wife had Dunkin Pancakes (I think that is what they were called) and she enjoyed them. Our daughter ordered the Apple doughnuts and they were amazing! Can't recall what the friends ordered but they both had nice things to say. It was a tad pricey (75 for 4 plus child) but I will return. The entire menu was loaded with stuff. I would like to try.
