I'm talking specifically about transgendered people and people who have gender disphoria. I think those people who are born one gender but claim to identify as another gender do so purely out of social understandings of gender roles and confuse enjoying traditionally opposite gender roles with actually being the opposite gender. I also believe that so-called "otherkin," or those who identify as another species, are no less valid than those who identify as another gender because a person's species is just as concrete as their gender and they those who criticize "otherkin" while simultaneously accepting gender disphoria are hypocritical. Furthermore, if someone feels so strongly that they are another gender that they seek to have surgery, I believe that should be treated as a serious mental illness that should be treated rather than reinforcing their belief by physically alerting their body permanently.
