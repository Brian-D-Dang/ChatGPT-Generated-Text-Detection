I know it doesn't make sense. I'm intelligent, progressive, and open-minded on any other subject I can think of. It looks like my state is about to legalize recreational marijuana; I actually voted in favor of it two years ago, and I probably will again. However, I personally detest it. I hate the smell. I hate that it dulls people over long periods of time, and I hate when people make it a lifestyle. But I don't want it to be a big deal to me. CMV, please! As a side note, I do totally favor marijuana for legitimate medical conditions over things like opiates and other pain medications which are far more harmful than marijuana. Hello, users of CMV!
