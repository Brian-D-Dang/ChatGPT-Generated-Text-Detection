For a single night? You wake up with dry eyes and it hurts a little but you wait 10 minutes or put some contact solution in your eyes and you're fine. For an extremely long period of time (monthsyears)? Maybe nothing... or maybe something nasty gets under the lens and ruins your eyes if you don't take them out and clean them. If you do something stupid? Well if your eyes are really dry and you try to get your contacts out without letting them re-hydrate.... at best you end up with a piece of contact stuck in your eye which hurts (but will come out eventually).... at worst you can tear part of your eye (the cornea) which is really really bad. In any case - Contact lenses are foreign objects in the eye. The reason they can stay there at all is because they are regularly lubricated (by your eye) and cleaned (by contact solution). Even then they get dirty and decay over time which is why (most) contacts have a lifespan. There aren't a lot of consequences for leaving them in one night.... but there are plenty of reasons to take them out at least once in awhile.," "There are 3 reasons. 1. Your eyes need oxygen, even the surface. Unless the contacts are designed for it, the surfaces of your eyes become oxygen deprived and can cause problems. 2. Dry contacts cause corneal scratches. If you leave your contacts in while sleeping, you don't have the normal blinking process that re wets all areas of the lens. Or, if you sleep with partially open eyes, the same happens. As contacts dry they start to scratch the surface of your eye which can compound into long term damage. 3. Infection. The longer you have contacts on, the longer it is before your natural body's cleaning mechanisms (tears and blinking) can clean the surface of the eye. If bacteria is trapped under or around the edges of the lens, they can breed, leading to eye infection.
