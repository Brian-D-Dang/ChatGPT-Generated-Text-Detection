I thought that I had caught the end of happy Hour as I entered about 6:30pm, but I was wrong. Cadillac ranch has Happy Hour all night on Monday, so it was 12 price drinks and appetizers for as long as you stayed. Being a huge soft pretzel fan, that's where my money went tonight. Originally 8.99, these are really, really good, but probably not for full price. Two huge hot pretzels and a very unique dipping sauce which was a vat of cream cheese fondue. It was a dreamy combination. They also have a huge projector screen TV in the middle of bar and an outdoor and indoor bar. Nice place for happy hour and football, especially on Monday's.
