Speaking as an American, I think that the United States Congress should be disbanded and replaced with the popular vote of the nation. I believe that online voting with biometrics would be a suitable way to do this as well as local voting locations. We can transfer the cost of maintaining Congress to fund this program and if need be I think the nation would overwhelmingly approve of finding extra funding in order to give the finger to D.C. We could still have a President and still have political parties in America but instead of having that party decide the course of our democracy while listening to our humble suggestions of what we want, we could have political parties suggesting to us what to choose. Parties, and individualssmall teams, could write up laws, advertise, and nationally debate them. When citizens go to vote they can select a Democrat, Republican, or a Third party vote package which would come with the option of personally editing and customizing to your political interest.
