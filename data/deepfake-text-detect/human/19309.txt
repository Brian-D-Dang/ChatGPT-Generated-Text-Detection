If I can begin with disclaimers: I endorse no illegal activity depicted in the show. I endorse none of the 'pack mentality' or 'macho-power' roles in the show. Neither do I necessarily endorse the hierarchical relationships between men which so often result in pissing matches for the point of proving who is the better at being a 'man'. I am focused solely on the relationship between Jax and Opie. In the show, Jackson (Jax) and Opie have grown up together with their respective father (figures) being part of the original 9 who started the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, a 1, that is to say criminal, enterprise. In the show, Jax and Opie operate in a manner showing their brotherhood. Without sharing any spoilers for the show (which I recommend above and beyond all other shows), the interaction between the two men represents what I believe the relationship between two heterosexual men in Western society should be at its core. The support each other in all things. They stand behind one another in their decisions. They express direct affection and love for one another, both in physical expressions and in verbal. They are dedicated to one another's families. And most importantly they are able to express conflict, when they do disagree, in a way that allows space, discussion, and ultimately, a statement of love and devotion to one another, even if there is a resolution to the issue that doesn't fit both or either's view of the situation. I would say that there are two ways to discuss this: Either change my view that their relationship is the best possible example or Change my view that their relationship is a valid example at all. So, lets begin. CMV.
