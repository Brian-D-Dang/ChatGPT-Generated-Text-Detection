I don't believe that I'm fulfilling some kind of social contract by watching someone's ads during video content, and that if they want to make money off of my viewership they should find a superior way to monetize than what they are doing. Instead most content providers these days have gone to denying access to adblock users, which honestly is probably pretty fair but, why turn viewership away? I believe that the entire internet business model is backwards in that, in the regular world businesses change to create the way people consume whereas with the internet it decides on how it wants it's people to consume. A prime example of this is the Xbox one and it's "always on" kinect model and how fan outrage actually forced a business model change. Whereas adblock users are made to enjoy a minute long silent image saying "this is where an ad would be if adblock was off, by the way the ad is 30 seconds" After reading something like that, I'm actually more deterred to disabling adblock on principal alone. Want my money? Sell me a sweet tee-shirt based on your content, not by running irrelevant ads. CMV tl;dr: Content producers should monetize in a way the consumer wants to spend their money, not force ads down their throat.
