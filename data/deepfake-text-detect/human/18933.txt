I think that the Batman in the "Justice League" cartoon is the best incarnation of Batman in TV or film. Batman is a superhero whose superpower is being rich and awesome. In all the movies he's ever been in either he's a clown, albeit a funny one (Adam West), a wimp (Michael Keaton), overly feminine looking (Val Kilmer), an asshole (George Clooney), or a snob (Christian Bale.) The cartoon Batman is superior to all of these "real life" incarnations because he is far more human, he's kinder, smarter, and funnier. He can be both Batman and Bruce, using his experiences in each life to inform his decisions in the other life, and he never forgets that his adversaries are people too - something that separates Batman from many other superheroes. Further, Batman is billed as the World's Greatest Detective, a title which I feel should imply that he's... you know... smarter than the average person. In many film and TV versions of him, he's little more than the least stupid person in a town full of stupid people. This is to some degree even true in Batman: The Animated Series, where he often gets "detective credit," if you will, for very stupid observations. Which brings me to The Justice League. Here he is almost never shown as Bruce Wayne - although he has a very human side to him still. But he's always around other superheroes, giving him the opportunity to show why he deserves to be there. He is smart, funny, calculating and efficient. The other members of the team: three are from other planets (Superman, Martian Manhunter, Hawkgirl), one can run at like .99c (Flash), and one has a crazy magic ring that can do anything (Green Lantern). Batman has nothing but his wits and his gadgets - he's not even super strong. And yet he earned himself an honored position on the team. So I think that the Batman in the "Justice League" cartoon is the best incarnation of Batman in TV or film. Change my view. (There's too many serious CMV's, let's have some fun!)
