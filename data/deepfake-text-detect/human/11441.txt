A Chinese court has granted Qualcomm an injunction against Apple in a patent infringement case. The patents affect all devices sold with iOS 11 or earlier, so all iPhones from the 6S through the X. The iPhones are currently still on sale in China, Qualcomm has to file a complaint to the enforcement tribunal to get the ban enforced, and Apple will have a chance to appeal. Apple says "Qualcomm's effort to ban our products is another desperate move by a company whose illegal practices are under investigation by regulators around the world."
