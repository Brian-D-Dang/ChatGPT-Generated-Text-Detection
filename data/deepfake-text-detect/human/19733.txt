This post was inspired by arguments about women in combat arms units. When I was serving I failed to meet a single female that could achieve a perfect score on our fitness test. Later on I fought professionally in mixed martial arts and never saw a women who could beat a man of equal levels of training. To this day the world's top female athletes can consistently be beaten by high school men, the women's Olympic hockey team for the US was beaten by a high school team in Minnesota. How can I believe that women will ever achieve the same physical successes as men? CMV
