I hear all the time how 'x' is a fundamental human right (whether it be water in detroit, welfare, a basic living wage, etc.) We are all born in poverty and the things you get are a function of your usefulness in society. That would seem to break down with the recent lifestyle of big business CEOs, except when you stop to realize that the reason they are so rich is due to the expensive services they provide to so many people (debating whether they're right or wrong is a different thread entirely). I think your success or failure is entirely dependent on your own tenacity and will to succeed, and almost entirely separate from your race, gender or socio-economic background and that people who espouse that everything is a 'basic human right' are lazy and ungrateful. Edit: to clarify my point (thanks usennalvera), many things i hear described as a basic human right (food, money, water) are supplied or delivered thanks to the work of others. How is it acceptable to take those things from those who supply them and give them to those who have done nothing to earn them, under threat of legislative fiat, given that we live in an economy where obtaining them is not only possible but relatively easy. Also, success and lack thereof is relative. for a poor kid growing up on 8 mile, success could be getting a manufacturing job in the midwest and affording a decent house in a small town. not everyone gets to be a billionaire. Edit 2: Life not birth, thanks uJamesDK Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
