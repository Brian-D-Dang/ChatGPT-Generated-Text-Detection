No one wants to touch your question because pimples are icky. This has probably been asked before. Do a search. Pimples are inflammations of pores of the skin. You can look up inflammation and the process. White blood cells are reacting to the situation. They are probably fighting invasive bacteria. There are many levels of protection the body has to fight infections so pimples, though icky, are self limiting. In the long run they all will likely go away although maybe a few will not just because of the tremendous range of infections. You just will not wait long enough. But as I said they are generally self limiting. Solid cores mean no drainage. Drainage helps the healing process. So removing the core will help the healing process. It opens the pore.','A zit that has a core is most likely not red, raised and painful. It is a clogged pore, the pore is full of compressed grit, oil and pus if there was once an active infection there. Zits that are painful will rarely have a core, as it is "still forming." The active infection benefits from drainage of pus, and clearing of the pore, so liquid pimples without cores are the same as those with cores just at a different stage of their life. They may never form a core of properly treated. On the other and, blackheads or other types of pimples with cores and no liquid pus are not the result of active infections, rather the blocking of a hair follicle most likely. I am not a skin doctor nyself, but I come from a long line of doctors, many specialising in skin disease. My favourite medical saying from my grandfather was "never let pus rest beneath the skin," with a caveat, never squeeze pimples on your forehead. Pull the skin either side apart. If it doesn't come out, use a warm cloth over the area to draw the pus closer to the surface. Soldiers in WW 1 and 2 died this way squeezing infected wounds into their bloodstream, leading to further infection. Sorry I got a bit off track, hope this helps!
