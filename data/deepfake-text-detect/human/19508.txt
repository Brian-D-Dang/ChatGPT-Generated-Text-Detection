Specifically: "You want a better situation for blacks? Give them a chance to revive their neighborhoods and culture. Work with the good people to stop the bad people. [...] You can't legislate good parenting or responsible entertainment. But you can fight against the madness with discipline, a firm message and little tolerance for excuse making. It is now time for the African American leadership, including President Obama, to stop the nonsense. Walk away from the world of victimization and grievance and lead the way out of this mess." and The Factor host called out the entertainment industry for glorifying a "gansta" culture to impressionable children. "Hey, listen up you greed-heads. If a kid can't speak proper English, uses the f-word in every sentence, [...] is disrespectful in his or her mouth, that child will never, never be able to compete in the marketplace of America. [...] And it had nothing to do with slavery. It has everything to do with you Hollywood people and you derelict parents. You're the ones hurting these vulnerable children." I agree entirely. If a man gets caught with drugs, he can't bitch about race because he had drugs on him. I understand a black man is more likely to be searched, arrested, tried and convicted- but only if he has drugs in the first place. Black culture (well, BETMTVClear Channel black culture) is counter to anything productive in any community ie glorifying violence, drugs, and fiscal irresponsibility. I can't abide the thought of agreeing with bill o'reilly, so please CMV. Edit: I will be putting up a couple (at least!) deltas when I get home from work. Don't stop changing my view, I never get tired of hearing how I'm wrong.
