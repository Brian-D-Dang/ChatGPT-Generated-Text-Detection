One main argument I've seen against the Bernie Sanders "free college tuition" idea is that if everyone has a college degree, the value of a degree goes down. Is this true? In countries like Germany and Denmark, only the best of students make it into higher education, whereas in American, our standards to get into a university or a community college are laughable. Would we need to raise the bar on admission requirements if college was free? The main argument here is that making college education free in our system would end up hurting the overachieving students.
