Whenever I say this, 100 of the time I get the following response: "Yes but if everybody behaved like you, no one would vote, and then one vote WOULD make a difference." My answer to this alternates depending my my mood: "So?" "But will everyone do that?" "Thanks for the compliment that everybody in society follows my lead and won't vote if I don't. The problem is that I can't see it" Please consider the above responses before making this argument. Also consider the relevance of: you are more likely to get run over on the way to the polling station than your vote to make a difference. Thanks!
