Im not sure what "legal retardation" is, but I can explain Mental Retardation; to be legally classified as having "Mental Retardation" (Now referred to as an Intellectual disability) must meet specific requirements. you must have an IQ under 75, you must be limited in at least 2? skills that affect your everyday living or the way that you adapt andor function when placed in a social environment, and the symptoms must be present from any age BEFORE 18. If you're using the term "legally retarded" to describe someone who is legally diagnosed with an Intellectual Disability, there is no difference between legal retardation and mental retardation','Having an IQ below 85 is legal retardation. They lack the capabilities and judgment of normal individuals.
