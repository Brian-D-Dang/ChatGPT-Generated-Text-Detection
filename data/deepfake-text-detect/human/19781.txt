Osama Bin Laden's expressed goals were to bankrupt our country, spread our military too thin across the globe, and attack in guerrilla style attacks to slowly chip away at the morale of our country.

Our interventionist policies, including drone strikes inside of sovereign countries, kill civilians and further hatreds towards the U.S. CMV
