I think that space travel is an interesting concept, and I don't argue against learning more about outer space, however when I hear people complain about NASA's budget I just don't see what all the fuss is about. I mean, why should governments, whose main priority is to benefit the people and their respective nation, be forking over money to travel to places that will do little to benefit Earth (Although I do agree that many governments should top spending as much on their militaries) This probably comes down to personal preference, but I also think that the places we have the potential to go to in space aren't very interesting. If we really want to explore the unknown why not explore the deep ocean, that would be less expensive and we would actually see new species, while we probably won't find anything as interesting in our solar system. Ultimately, I think that we should focus on our own planet before others, but I am open to arguments as to why we need to travel into space.
