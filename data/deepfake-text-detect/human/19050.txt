Telling your wifegf to get her tits in the kitchen even when being playfully sardonic is offensive to most people, not only for the lack of humor but in principle. The joke is only funny as some form of anti-humor but nonetheless exists as a depressing reminder of oppressive gender roles experienced by everyone. When I see girls make similar jokes about men it's frustratingly hypocritical. "Guys? you mean sex toys that are rude?" should be no more acceptable than it's female equivalent. Yet self proclaimed feminists espouse that stuff enthusiastically, passing it around like my dad with an Obama meme. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
