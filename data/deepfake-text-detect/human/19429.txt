I think that, if you are someone who ultimately wants to be in a relationship, it is impossible to be single and happy. The notable exception to this would be persons who genuinely wish to remain single. For those who wish to be in a relationship but cannot accomplish this task, being single is a step below going without food. We wouldn't tell someone who had no food to be happy, right? Would you tell someone who is dirt poor to just be happy? No, you tell them to work hard to not be poor. Unfortunately, you can't say that to a single person. There is no hard and fast formula for finding a partner. The cliche line is that you have to be happy with being single before you can be happy being in a relationship. I often hear this uttered by happily partnered people who I know for a fact would be miserablebat sh insane if they weren't partnered off, but I suppose that is besides the point. Why do we lie and say things like this? Being single is an implicit acknowledgement that something about you is off. It is an acknowledgement that something is so wrong with you, that you cannot find another human being who wants to partner up with you, which is a fundamental thing that humans do in order to continue our species. If no one wants you, and that is your fundamental purpose as an animal, how are you supposed to be happy? Please change my view that, even if you never find your soul mate and desperately want to find that person, it is somehow possible to have a modicum of happiness. EDIT-I meant highly likely to be single forever, not just temporarily single, but withthe likely possibility of finding someone when one is ready. I meant more someone with a genetichealth condition who is highly unlikely to find someone. Is it possible to be happy when the odds are heavily against you and it's virtually impossible that you will find someone? Tl;dr-is it possible to be happy with being single if your ultimate goal is to not be single?
