It seems to me that life coming from hydrothermal vents is a more complicated hypothesis than 'all life evolved due to the Sun's energy.' Although nobody knows for certain where and how exactly original life came into being (that is a different discussion). Hypotheses come from original philosophical ideas. Philosophically, isn't it wiser to go with the more sensible and simple argument? It is more sensible for me to believe that life did not originate from hydrothermal vents. Wikipedia says that a hydrothermal origin of life.."is an attractive hypothesis .." But I am not convinced. Couldn't original life from the Sun's energy evolved downward for better conditions, ultimately to end up thriving with the of vents on the ocean floor?
