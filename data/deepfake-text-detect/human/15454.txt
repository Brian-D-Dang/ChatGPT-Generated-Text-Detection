We have shopped and bought tires at various Discount Tires over the years, including this one. The service is great and they are more than willing to work with you in finding the right tire for your car. Recently, we needed two Michelin MXV4s for one of our cars. We shopped online at DiscountTire.com and found the tires we wanted. Priced it out, paid, reserved the tires for this location and just came in to have them mounted balanced. Nice! In the end, it saved us 65 over their previous quote. Also, nice!
