Every year I do my taxes and show the government exactly how much I make how much I have spend and on what so they can decide how much money to take from me. Then they spend it on things I do not agree with. I think every year when we do taxes we should also get the ability to determine where we want it to go, such as 50 education 24 community building (roads, cleaning ect.) 5 military, you get the idea. The system could be either that your money goes directly into those sectors based on your preferences or having everyone's numbers get averaged out so you wouldn't be able to say that the rich are getting an unfair advantage in controlling the nation. Edit: I don't know why everyone thinks this but I do not live in the United States, I live in Canada. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
