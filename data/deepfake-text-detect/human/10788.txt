isnt that what their tax funding is? but seriously, they could try.... but a few issues I see. How many times can they go to that well before people get bored? will anyone crowd fund the "mundane" programs? Theyll be a dancing monkey instead of pursuing potentially more beneficial, but not glamorous, missions.
