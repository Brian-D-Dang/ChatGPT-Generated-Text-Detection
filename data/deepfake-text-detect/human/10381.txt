How can you convince me that all the nations that I'm allowed to visit aren't all working together to hide a bigger and better and more free world. Maybe the internet I know is actually just a restricted and monitored intranet. I personally don't know anyone who has tried to fly a plane in any direction they wanted for as long as they wanted, so maybe all commercial airlines are restricted to brother nations that perpetuate the lie. You get the idea, convince me we aren't in North Korea 2. EDIT: I think you guys are on to something with the extent of GPS involvement in the shipping and modern day travel that would need to be manipulated. It would be too intricate, and the lack of oppression makes it that much more unlikely. I wish I could give you all , but I'm giving it to uGnosticGnome, because of how clear and calm heshe was. Thanks guys. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things. Firstly, please remember to [read through our rules] .
