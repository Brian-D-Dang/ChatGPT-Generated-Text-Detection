I am not of course arguing that it shouldn't be illegal to record a client talking to their lawyer or obtain evidence without a search warrant. Also false evidence is of course bad. But unethical police conduct doesn't change whether someone did or didn't commit a crime, and what the appropriate course of action is, and the law should work to convict the guilty and leave the innocent alone. It's always seen as a tragedy when the guilty walk free because of legal technicalities. It offers no comfort to anyone if someone guilty of a violent crime is back on the street because the police cut a few corners (I have heard that genuine evidence isn't admissible if it was obtained with the aid of illegal wiretaps, for example). Wasn't sure whether to make this an ELI5 or a CMV; I really can't get my head around why it's so bad for people who a jury is convinced have committed a crime to go to jail on evidence that, while not very "sporting," is genuine. At any rate, a jury told to disregard evidence can't "unhear" a recording of someone discussing with their lawyer the fine details of going for a false insanity plea, and the legal system should reflect the fact that this is compelling evidence.
