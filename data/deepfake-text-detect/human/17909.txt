I believe that parents need to limit how much their children play video games. It seems as though the culture has shifted from wanting to go outside and playing a pick-up game of baseball at the neighborhood field to playing MLB The Show, which is indeed a video game. Video games are fun, but they do not provide any type of physical exercise for the kids in any way. It teaches them a lazy lifestyle. Therefore, they should be in moderation. I believe that parents need to take their own initiative and set a limit as to how much time their kids spend playing them. They should also encourage them to go outside and play a multitude of sports until they find one they like. As long as they put the controllers down for some time and exercise, that is all that matters. CMV
