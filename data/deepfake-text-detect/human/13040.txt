"There's no time to think, man!" What the hell? "Get down! Hide!" Where was the parade, the elephant? What is an elephant? I liked the elephant. I'm shaken from my thoughts as my arm is violently pulled towards the ground by the creature (what is a creature?). "Snap out of it, the suit don't make you immortal, nomad!" The creature is agitated. It sure makes obnoxious noises. I think it likes me? Like. Likes. What is that? Positives and negatives. I can feel them. My..... body? Arms. Arms are weird. I'd better just get used to them because the creature is moving again and flapping its around like it..... means..... something to me? Shaking, I think that's what we (?) call it when the things move around. It always moves, but this time it's all the things. Noise. m hy llG? Not sure. Shaking again. "Up ahead! Be ready." The creature motions again. I think it wants me to do a thing. Flashing. Rapid successions of sound burst from the end of something the creature is holding. Is that a toy? It looks fun so I'll call it a toy. It looks really fun. Oh, neat. I have one too. Fireworks! 'n 'rf hw'l! "Jesus man, what's gotten into you? Pull yourself out of it!" INTO me!? I can speak. "What's in me? How do I get it out!?" I yell at the creature. Was I too loud (and who am I asking)? The creature is making me feel frantic. I'm desperately searching my mind to determine what an inside or an outside is. I'm not ready for this. I didn't ask for this and I'm still not sure who I would have asked anyway. "It's here!" A much larger creature has demonstrated quickly to me insides and outsides. It's in here now. I don't like the big one, it is not at all like the elephant. I really liked the elephant and I think I'm starting to understand what it means to like something, or, at least dislike something. My'friend' tears at my arm again. The feeling is captivating. Sensations. Interesting word, sensation. Also'interesting.' I'm baffled and my breath pops out of me in bursts. Hha hha. "Listen. I don't know what your deal is, but if you don't pull it together, you're going to get us both killed!" My friend looks at me with wild eyes. Such depth of texture and color and such a small space. Iris? I see what it is to see. He looks up and swings his rifle to aim at the beast and sounds erupt. I jump to the east. Whoa. I'm fast. I've done this before. I was made for this. I kick off the wall of what was left of a hallway as I draw my rifle and open fire. Waves obscure my vision. I guide them. I know this. I see where to direct my onslaught and snap rapidly in orbit around the monstrosity, finding my target. I don't have to think, I just..... do. To the soundtrack of morphing metal and bone the beast writhes as it gives up its ghost. I'm on my feet. I no longer care what they are. I know what they can do. So does my friend. "I thought we'd had it back there. I don't know who you are, or why you're here, but if you can do that, let's see what we can make of those Koreans." I nod. I don't like Koreans.
