Ok let's start at the beginning.... Price is expensive but it's convenient and the facilities are top notch. Love the pools, the vast array of cardio equipment and layout. So many classes to choose from if they fit in your schedule and the kids area is great, they even have kids cardio classes! However now that summer break is here there are too many kids everywhere during the day after 12, in the mornings it's not as bad. The place is clean and the trainers clean the equipment daily. The locker room is constantly being cleaned and I like the family locker room idea too. The cafe is ok.... Healthy options but high calorie and carb, no egg white options, fresh veggie juices, or such that I see. List nice to have a gym that recognizes families and has movie nights at the pool, and pool day events.
