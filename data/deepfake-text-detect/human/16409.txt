Head pose estimation is an important pre-processing step in many pattern recognition and computer vision systems such as face recognition. Since the performance of the face recognition systems is greatly affected by the pose of the face, how to estimate the accurate pose of the face in the face image is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a novel method for head pose estimation. To enhance the efficiency of the estimation we first use contourlet transform for feature extraction. Contourlet transform is a multi-resolution, multi-direction transform. Finally, in order to reduce the feature space dimension and obtain appropriate features, we use LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to remove inefficient features. Then, we apply k-nearest neighborhood (k-NN) and minimum distance classifiers to classify the pose of head. We use the public available FERET database to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Simulation results indicate the efficiency of the proposed method in comparison with previous method.
