I went on a vacation to Arizona from Chicago and was told king gyros had great food. The food wasn't great it was beyond fantastic I don't know where to start. I kept on ordering out when I was there for 2 weeks and this is the only restaurant I would ever fly out for it I became a millionaire. Great family owned business and fantastic food.
