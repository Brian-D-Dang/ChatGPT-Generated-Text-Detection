I think that America is full of lazy, self-important, invasive, ugly, and prideful ego-maniacs who care about them and their country and nothing else. I think it's time to change the Americans and its society. There are many ways to do this, like mix some cultures with the Americans, and do it like India, a country with united cultures. How about put half of the Israeli population into Georgia, 14th of the Japanese population into Florida, and 14th of the Italian population into Louisiana? Yeah, make English, Hebrew, Japanese, and Italian official languages. Make Christianity, Judaism, Shinto, and Buddhism official religions. Make the country observe holidays of Israel, Japan, and Italy. Make the country build everything for the Israelis, Japanese, and Italians. Make the Americans respect Israeli, Japanese, and Italian cultures. Now that would not only be cool, but also make Americas better. Also, shove the Rural Population of the US into cities by law. This will change the Americans backward ways. Use some of the rural lands for energy, farming, anything. Leave the other rural areas for the wild.
