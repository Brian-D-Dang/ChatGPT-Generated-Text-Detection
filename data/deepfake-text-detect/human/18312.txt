For the record, this stems from being a suicidal teenager myself (now in my mid twenties) and I often regret not having gone through with itbeing stopped from doing it. I sadly and honestly believe that people should not be stopped from killing themselves if they feel like they want to. On the positive side, if they really feel like they don't want to be on this earth, they will be reducing the population little by little (since the human race is growing exponentially almost; EDIT, THIS IS NOT TRUE, thank you for the correction). Often people who are so depressed that they are suicidal are not contributing much to society, they are essentially taking more than they are giving back to the community. That being said, the encouragement part I definitely need to explain. I do NOT by any means think that it should be actively encouraged! I do however think that if someone tells you that they are going to kill themselves (not just want to) that your response to them should be a simple, "okay, it was nice knowing you." Or something along those lines. EDIT 2:another question, why do people put so much pressure by saying "youll hurt so many people" and things like that? tl;dr I believe suicidal people don't contribute optimally to society
