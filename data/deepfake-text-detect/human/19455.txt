I think that the belief that certain economic and social conditions are indefinitely self-sustaining or inherently stable is built on a false assumption about human nature. The proposition that human beings can be made content with rational social institutions assumes that human nature is itself rational. However, if human beings are fundamentally discontented with life or only truly happy when they engage in non-rational goods, then I fail to see how these social institutions can provide contentment to its people. And, as long as people aren't content, the possibility for radical change remains. I believe these times, and the liberal democracy and free-markets that accompany them, will inevitably give way to the next. And, I believe that this will be the order of things as long as human society exists. Can anyone convince me otherwise? Edit: for those of you who don't know what 'end of history' implies, it is a term of art used to describe a special set of social and economic circumstances. These conditions, if actualized, will create a stable social system that will not be overturned by proceeding developments. This picture of history was advanced by philosophers like Hegel and political scientists like Fukiyama.
