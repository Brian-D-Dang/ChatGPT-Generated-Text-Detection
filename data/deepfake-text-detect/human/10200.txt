I have a few friends who sleep around a lot. One person in particular told me yesterday that they had slept with 6 people in the last two weeks (I'm keeping this purposefully gender-neutral to avoid a biased response). They didn't massively like any of the partners as people, they just wanted to have sex. Which is fine. I love sex, and I think it's great, but I could never feel okay with having that many sexual partners in such a short space of time. I can't help but feel that there must be something deeply broken about someone who IS okay with it. Either they're very insecure and in need of some sort of validation, or they have no respect for themselves and a very low sense of self-worth. Change my view please! Hello, users of CMV!
