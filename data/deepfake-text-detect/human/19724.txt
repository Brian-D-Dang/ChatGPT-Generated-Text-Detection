Recently, the Coalition have tightened up laws challenging surrounding the promotion of Islamic fundamentalism. The Tories have also promised new ones in their 2015 manifesto, including 'Banning Orders' and 'Extremism Disruption Disorders' which basically ban people from broadcasting these views. The idea is that with less people vying for Jihadism, less people will hear about it and then become radicalised. But it seems to me that without turning the UK into a police state, these views will continue to be spread regardless (although probably at a lower rate). The difference here will be that any teenager considering radicalisation won't be able to openly admit this, discuss it with others, and eventually change their mind. Instead, this teenager would face arrest if they spoke frankly about their concerns; and most likely the only person they could discuss this with is a hate preacher, who -for obvious reasons- wouldn't exactly give them both sides to the argument. Britain has always done things the democratic way, knowing that the only way to find solutions to issues is through open and honest debate. This has lead to society in which people are far more likely to resolve issues through dialogue, not violence. To give you an example of this, at the turn of the 20th century Britain became more democratic than ever before by handing more power to its elected assembly (the Houses of Commons); and despite two world wars, the rise of socialism and fascism, and the Great Depression, the country has never faced any major internal conflict (i.e a civil war) since. Conversely, at around the same time the Russian government was tightening its grip on public opinion, and since then has faced three revolutions, a four-year civil war, endemic Islamic insurgency and an almost unbroken reign of tyranny. I don't believe sticking your head in the sand over an issue can lead to its resolution. Reddit, change my view.
