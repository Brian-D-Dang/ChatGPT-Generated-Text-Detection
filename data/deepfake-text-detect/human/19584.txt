Washington Redskins, Chicago Blackhawks, Atlanta Braves, Cleveland Indians. The list goes on, and that's just at the level of professional sports. There has obviously been a lot of controversy surrounding these names, and there are movements with varying degrees of popular support to change some if not all of them. I believe that movements to change these names create racial tension where there was none before. When a team chooses and name to represent them, they usually look for something that (a) connotes superiority, or (b) ties to the local heritage. Generally, the names I referenced above meet both of those criteria, and the very fact that an organization adopts a name indicates that they view it in a positive light. It could be said that it would be more racist to deny the impact of Native American heritage on our present culture. That's what I believe, but I'm genuinely curious to understand the views of the opposition, and I am completely open to having my view changed.
