I don't believe that innocent children should have to be subjected to the homes of a non-custodial parent that pays child support. After support payments, barring professional athletes and Hollywood incomes, most of those that pay child support have a much, much lower standard of living than the custodial parent. It is unfair to the child to have to see this "parent," or what's left of them, under any circumstance. There's no reason that a happy, healthy, well-fed child should have to think that "half" of their make-up comes from such a failure. CMV
