I am quite young (18), and as such I believe I have a naive perspective on this. My take on it is that where there is an element of human error, the product will not be as good as if it were made by a machine. For example, Rolls Royce is a largely 'hand made' car. If I were to buy a car, I would want it to be made by a machine which would have less of a margin of error than a human. Of course this doesn't apply when it comes to things like paintings by famous people or something where the human element adds to the value. Do I just not have an appreciation for hand-made things? Why should I have one? CMV or tell me why I'm right!
