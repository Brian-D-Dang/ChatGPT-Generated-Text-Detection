Truly awful service and food! Think of half the quality of Denny's food for three times the price! I would never go back. Very sad when you consider there are nice places in Golden Nugget like Vic Anthony's but the nice places close before midnight on a weekend in Las Vegas? What are they thinking!??! Another terrible place to avoid in Golden Nugget is the Chart House. Wayne Gorsek
