I've never really believed in chemtrails, and I actually heard and read all the explanations that it's nothing but water-damp. Recently, however, I'm meeting a lot of people because of the politic situation here in the south of Europe, and there are many of them that do believe in chemtrails. Now, I've always considered these people as hippies that are completely nuts, but lately I've seen different conspiracies turning to be not such conspiracies, and also, I start to see serious sane people, that are also convinced about chemtrails, but they're very reluctant to talk about it, as you know, there's some stigma about it. Then I bumped into I still don't believe in chemtrails, but I'm not absolutely sure anymore, so CMV.
