I see both sides to the argument. News reporters get payed to write up stories and the news organizations also get advertizing revenue to print and broadcast the news. Sources should be payed a portion of these profits. Sources should not be paid, the only reason we pay reporters is that they know how to write up the information so it is readable. Paying sources promotes disreputable sources to lie. Important news should not only be the domain of the highest bidder. I don't think this is an important issue. Why should I take a side on this issue? And why should I take that side?
