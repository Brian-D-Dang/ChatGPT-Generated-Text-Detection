I don't believe that the government has the right to make human cloning illegal because the act of cloning a person does not alone violate ethics. If a surrogate is willing to accept a cloned fetus, and the person being cloned gives their consent as well, it's simply a woman having a child. I think that current arguments against cloning are rooted in fear or pseudo-ethics. I'm no utilitarian; it's very clear that our society awards 'human rights' on the basis of simply being a human. Additionally, fear that a clone would be mistreated or demeaned is no reason to take away the surrogate and DNA donor's rights to use their bodies as they please without hurting others. There is also no real reason why cloning should be illegal on the basis of human dignity and being unnatural: if that's true, we might as well outlaw IVF. In closing, arguments against cloning are rooted in fear. Whether or not these doomsday scenarios in which cloning is legal occur, they aren't enough to violate people's rights to their own bodies.
