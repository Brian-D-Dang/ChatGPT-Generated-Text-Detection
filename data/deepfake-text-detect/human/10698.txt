It does? My 3 year old is terrified of vacuuming and will run away screaming and curl up on the sofa shaking in fear meanwhile the one dog I had couldn't give a shit, or move...in fact, he kind of liked being massaged with the vacuum cleaner. My son is so afraid of it that his elder sisters threaten him with it just to get him out of their room. You just have to mention the word and he pegs it.,Newborns are sometimes calmed by white noise a vacuum a hair dryer etc. A dog is just scared.
