I sat on a bench one fine Autumn day Hoping for sunshine to take me away To a place where grass grows all over large fields As beautiful flowers nip at my heels When all of a sudden, I caught quite a sight! A girl in short shorts had walked through the light Oh my, how her booty had flowed And all I could think was about the wild oats I'd sow With her in my bed, her rear in my face Titties a jigglin' all over the place Sweat from my brow would start to descend And pour onto her delicious back end The sex would be great, the sex would be neat My load would eventually cover her feet She knew what I wanted, she saw in my eyes Walking on by with her milky white thighs Lo and behold, she stopped for a talk! She asked me my name, I replied with Raoul A Mexican immigrant who would definitely "clean out her pool" She giggled and winked, and told me to guess What she was called, with a smiling request "Amy, Ashley, maybe Annabelle?" "Why, no, silly, my name is Michelle!" What a pretty name, is all I could muster As my groin region started to flutter She told me she lived in a house by the park And that I should come over when it got dark I started to panic Lord was this manic! I told her I would be there at eleven that night And she would be in for quite a sight Her face suddenly frowned, and I didn't know what was the matter She told me eleven was too late for our genitals to clatter I squinted my eyes and then She suddenly she told me she was seventeen, that's why! School came early the next day, and she needed to rest But she still wanted me to press my face to her breasts Well I hopped the fuck off of that park bench that day No way was I going to jail for a roll in the hay So this is the tale of how I learned to avoid tail Because none of you motherfuckers would ever post my bail
