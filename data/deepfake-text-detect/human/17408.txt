It's one thing when either mom (or dad in some cases) has to raise and take care of their children but it's another thing when a couple has no children and one person pays for everything. I notice this a lot. For example, my friend lives in an apartment with his girlfriend but my friend is the one paying all the bills, the food, the electricity,rent,etc while his girlfriend goes shopping. So many couples do it and it's so fucked up! A committed relationship is an equal partnership so why should one person bust their ass while the other one just smooches.
