Let me start by saying that I fully believe that women and men should both have equal rights. I'm not stating that we should make it illegal for a women to be president but I'm just questioning whether or not a women could take up the responsibility of running a nation as effectively as men. As we know most women have their periods every month. [After watching this video] and finding out that women get more moody every month I don't know how I should feel if a female president were to base her actions on her mood for that specific day. Some may say that the president could just numb her emotions and just base her decisions logically, but that's not how we work. Even if one were to try to diverge their emotional state from their decisions a little emotion will always creep in. I don't see how a women could be an effective president if her biological machine could affect her decisions in a such a way. I don't want to think this way and I would like to very much see a counter-argument to this because I absolutely think that both men and women should be allowed to run for president. I don't want to vote based on a misunderstood thinking. EDIT: Thanks for all your counters. You have CMV. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
