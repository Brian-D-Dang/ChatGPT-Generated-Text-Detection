In events where these cakes are displayed, like weddings and fund raisers, nobody gives a shit about how the cake tastes. It's basically just decoration.," "I know what you're saying, I agree and it pisses me off too, but you gotta understand that guy has quite a fucking talent. He can take an order that sometimes is very obscene and actually construct it into a fucking [poorly] edible cake. I know it's all for visualization and stuff, but I still think the cake should taste as amazing as it looks. I don't think it would be a bad idea to introduce someone to the show that purely works on developing good taste for the boss's needs. ie. Instead of a PVC pipe come up with some delicious hard-ass fruit cake.," "The praise is not for how edible the cake is, the praise is for the visual appeal, the intricate artwork and long hours of painstaking effort that went into creating a cake that looks like a work of art. I'm sure it doesn't taste that bad either, plus it probably tastes better than it ought to to the people eating it because it looks so good (just guessing at that one based on how a placebo effect works, could be completely wrong)," "I don't watch Cake Boss, but on Ace of Cakes (same idea - people building ridiculously elaborate cakes) they have shown that the bakery often brings a second sheet cake with them to the event. The fancy cake is basically the modern version of the ice sculpture. It's not meant to be functional, it's meant to be the eye candy (ha ha) that everybody admires before they go get their actual cake. TLDR: Have your cake, and eat it too.
