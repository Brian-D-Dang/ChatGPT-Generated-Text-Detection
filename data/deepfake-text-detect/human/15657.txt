I've only been coming to this salon the last two times, but I'm making appointments regularly. The salon itself is very clean, contemporary, good atmosphere and has young talent. I recommend Racquel, she is very sweet and will get to know you because she wants to not because she has to. I chose her because of the good reviews here on Yelp and they have been right on. She listens to what you want but also encourages you to try new things. She will bend over backwards to get you in on last minute and always communicates when there is a change. I think I've found a home!! I'm not going anywhere:
