I gotta say, I've held this view for a long time. In my experience, many people I have dated whose parents have broken relationships have had a series of issues. Whether they are just straight up "daddy issues," or other kinds of problems, I have noticed a real correlation between separated parents and "crazy" significant others. There are some exceptions for example, in which the role of a father has been "filled" by a very present grandfather, or something, but in most other cases, it causes real problems in the person's life that impact and cause problems with intimacy.
