I just heard on CNN the head of the Harlem Children's Zone tell a story about his black son getting arrested in NYC by hostile police who suspected him of being a criminal. He asked the cops why they suspected his son (who was innocent), and the cops said, "he fit the descriptionhe's wearing a cap and baggy pants." Like with women who wear revealing clothes and get lurid looks and worse from creepy men, the harassment could be minimized (if not removed completely) by wearing what most people in society considers "respectable." I've worn both respectable and non-respectable clothes, and the way I'm treated in shops, at banks, by people on the street, and so on has made me wear much more respectable clothes. So, why not put on a collared shirt and slacks, or less revealing clothes? CMV?
