In the unusual instance that CPR is actually successful on someone over 70 years old, the complications are just not worth it. Chest compressions done correctly are absolutely punishing on a young body, on an older person quality compressions will break bones. If a team is able to get your heart beating again on its own, there is a good probability that there will be some brain damage. I think that once you turn 70 you should automatically sign a DNR (do not resuscitate) order. If your heart stops beating or you stop breathing, that may just mean that your time is up. CMV.
