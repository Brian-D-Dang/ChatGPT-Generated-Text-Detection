The success of Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods has led to other plant-based meat replacements appearing in the market. 18 vegetable-based burgers, seven black bean burgers, and eight meat-analogue burgers were rated for their taste, texture, and appearance. The Impossible burger outperformed every other contender in every category, with tasters commenting on how all aspects of the plant-based meat was similar to a real meat burger. Beyond Meats burger came second, losing points on appearance. The Grillers Original Burger from MorningStar Farms was third place. Tasters thought that the flavor was bland, its appearance was unappealing, and said that the patty felt dry. Generally speaking, tasters were unenthusiastic about burgers that were not produced by Impossible or Beyond.
