I believe that religion is detrimental to society because of many reasons: 1. It tends to enforce a narrow minded way of thinking. 2. It enforces traditional views that are not fit for a modern world ex: anti-women rights, anti-gay rights 3. It causes a lot of violence and hatred. ex: Muslim extremists, Westboro Baptist Church 4. Religious organizations such as the Vatican have become so corrupt, ex: Pope Benedict covering up the molestation scandals 5. Its anti-science. The traditional views of religion go against science which is needed for the progression of society
