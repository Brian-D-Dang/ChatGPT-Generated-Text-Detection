In my mind, I see reasons why it should be illegal to smoke in public. 1. Litter. Cigarette butts are the top source of roadway litter in America (38) and the second largest source of litter on sidewalks after gum and candy (29.8) according to . It seems impossible these days to walk a full 20 yards without seeing at least one on the ground. 2. It's harmful for bystanders. Second-hand smoke can be just as harmful as first-hand. 3. Limiting smokers to their own homes would likely reduce the amount of times they smoke and in turn reduce the amount of illnesses caused by smoking throughout the country. In all honesty, it would just help them reduce their bad habit, and I see absolutely no benefits to allowing people to smoke in public. EDIT: Alright, I agree that "it's bothersome" isn't the best reason, but I do still think it should be illegal. I've replaced the first point with a much better one.
