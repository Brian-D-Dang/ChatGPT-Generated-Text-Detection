Their vocal chords aren't changing. What is changing is the amount of space those chords have to vibrate in and the amount of space those vibrations are given to resonate in the mouth. It's really a matter of adjusting throat muscles, jaw position, tongue placement and lip shape to effectively mimic the sound of someone's voice. Just watch [Billy West] (URL0) run through a list of voices he's done and pay attention to what his throat, jaw and mouth are doing as the voices change.," "there are a whole bunch of parts to the vocal system and they all work together to create a certain sound. For example, I could lift my whole larynx (voice box adam's apple) upward so that my adams apple is right at the top on my neck, and open up the flap that separates my mouth from the back of my nose (velum or soft palete) to speak with one kind of voice, or I could drop my larynx way down and speak with a loose jaw, etc. some people just mess around and happen to come across a voice they like, others specifically train themselves to be able to control all of their voice parts independently and then remember which combinations make specific voices.
