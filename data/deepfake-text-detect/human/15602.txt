I made a yelp solely to review this place. The food is delicious: very good ramen, I had the sweet shoyu broth, and the goji beef waffles are SO good. The food is the only good thing about this place. They BLAST awful music (eminem, nelly furtado, flo rida, etc.). The icing on the cake was the wierdest service I have ever experienced. The waitress came to our table what seemed liked 15 times every 2 minutes. She also had us introduce ourselves and shook our hands.... (?) needless to say the strange experience made my boyfriend say he never wants to come back lol. I'll be back for sure because the food is awesome, but I'll most likely take it to go.
