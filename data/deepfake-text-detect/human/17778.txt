This idea was bred from my experiences as a kid. I grew up in a very small, extremely white town. The number of minority kids I went to school with wouldn't exceed the number of fingers I possess. They were always among the most popular kids and prejudice against them was entirely non-existent. When Hurricane Katrina hit and people had to temporarily resettle, several black families ended up in my hometown. For the first time, I saw first hand what actually racial prejudice looked like, as this new group of people dressed different, talked different, participated in different activities, and mostly kept to themselves; while a section of the native populace (many of which were very close friends minority students mentioned above) began to spit plenty of vitriol in their direction. This struck me as odd, and it began to foster in my mind that many of the situations throughout history where race was involved had far more to do with people viewing other cultures as threatening or inferior and misdirecting the basis of their hatred at the people based on their immutable attributes and not at what they truly dislike. Edit: This does not mean that I don't believe pure racism exists (it does), only that people misplace the source of theirothers hate and it would be more constructive to expand the realms of causes. Also this thought does not condone prejudice based on race.
