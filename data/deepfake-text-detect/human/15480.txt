I really can't see why people knock this place. Admittedly, they don't have the widest selection in the world and some of the package sizes are a bit on the large side, but overall, it's hard to beat the value. I get almost all my staple items here such as milk, lettuce, bread, ground turkey etc. Ok so if I decide it's time for musubi, I'll have to make make a run to the good ole' wal mart for the seaweed and furikake. Other than that, smart n final pretty much has everything I need and at great prices. I'm definitely a loyal customer.
