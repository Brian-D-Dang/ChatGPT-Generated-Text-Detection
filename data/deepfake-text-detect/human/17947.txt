This will probably be quick, but I figured if I am indeed wrong some one should tell me. What I see as actually happening is that non promiscuous men are 99 of the time the ones who are "slut shaming" but in reality, aren't being hypocritical about it because they themselves aren't promiscuous. The idea that, as uahatmadeofshoes12 put it, that women are "sluts" and men are "studs" comes from two different groups. The men who arewant to sleep around and don't for the most part hold hypocritical beliefs about women's sexuality, in their group, hold the number of partners they've had as a standard for greatness. Men who don't support this ideology, or accept it, due to culture, but don't actually find it worth while to have multiple sexual partners and have non serious relationships, will often say things like slut shaming because they have legitimate personal credence to do so not because they think that women shouldn't be held to the same standard as men in terms of their own life. The reverse, to my knowledge at least, doesn't happen because women (and other men that don't share the same internal creed) think that most men think it's OK to have sexual relationships like this, because societies expectation is that men have high libidos and "their just fulfilling their desires." The problem is that the reality is reversed, average masturbation for males may be once per day, but this doesn't correlate to "how often I want to have sex" per day, and society greatly overestimates the want for males to have sex, while at the same time greatly underestimating female desire for sex. Society paradoxically thinks that men should have had sexual experience before any relationship as well, but with in the "stud" group, the idea is generally the same about women, they expect, in serious relationships, that these women would have had many sexual partners in the past.
