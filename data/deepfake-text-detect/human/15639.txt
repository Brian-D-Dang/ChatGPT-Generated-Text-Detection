Stopped by Delmonico's for my birthday, per a recommendation from a friend.... and I would not hesitate to come again. I had the Bone-in Ribeye and it was by far the best steak I've ever head, juicy and tender, and everything you want in a steak. I ordered some sides but wasn't even necessary, I couldn't even finish the steak! Service was great. A little on the pricey side but worth spending the money at least once.
