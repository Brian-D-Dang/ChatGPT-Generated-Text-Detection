Great food, but very slow service. It always takes forever to get food on the table. The place is always super busy, which I suppose is good, but don't expect to get seated too quickly. The food is delicious and I would recommend the pancakes and anything with chorizo! The hash browns are also very tasty. Nice place if you're into brunch food.
