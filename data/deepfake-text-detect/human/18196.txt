Maybe not the Truman Show exactly. I've flown overseas and traveled a lot further then Truman - he was confined to an Island. But I think fairly often about how it's entirely possible I'm just the main character in someone's game or show. I have free will and everything but sometimes things stack up so perfectly for or against me at the right time that it's difficult to think it's not being manipulated by other people. I'm not trying to make a religious argument here - I think the idea of a god as a supernatural being is nonsensical. I mean sometimes it feels like there are cameras following me around and telling people what to say to me to either piss me off EXACTLY how I could most be pissed off, or support me in exactly the way I need support.
