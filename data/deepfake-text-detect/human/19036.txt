I've read a few CMV's about this but none really managed to CMV. I believe that life begins at conception (for scientific reasons not religious) and that abortion is murder. Basically every argument for pro-choice I have heard is "put yourself in the mothers shoes if she was raped" and while I certainly feel bad for the women in that position I just don't think that any amount of emotional trauma is enough to allow you to kill a child. If there were some other way to let the baby live I would be all for it but there just isn't (yet). I'm okay with abortion when the mother andor kid will die from some sort of disease or something, as then having the kid wouldn't be saving anybody's life, but other than that I just can't see any reason for abortion as fine.
