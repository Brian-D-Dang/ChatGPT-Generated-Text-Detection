I work in EMS, and the amount of over weight practitioners in all the above mentioned professions is horrifying,Police and fire have physical fitness tests to gain employment but aren't held to any kind of standard once they have the job, kind of makes me think what the hell is the point? Sure you could run a 5 minute mile and lift your body weight when you were hired 5-10 years ago but now you're 50 lbs over weight and have no muscle mass what so ever. Kind of defeats the purpose of having physically fit practitioners eh?
