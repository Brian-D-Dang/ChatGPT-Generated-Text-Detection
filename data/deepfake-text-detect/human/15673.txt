This place has major potential! As is, it's pretty much friendly super suck. Adorable husband and wife team bickering in a foreign language? CHECK. Clean facilities and warm ownersemployees. CHECK. All personal recipes and made-from-scratch items? CHECK. But..crazy interior, weak following of menu, long wait time due to every.single.item being made from scratch while you wait (except bread, of course) and gallons of mayo on sandwiches? Check, check, check and check. The poor folks I bought sandwiches for actually threw them away because they were so incredibly drenched and overpowered by the mayo. Tried a second time, ordering something slightly different, and still nothing special. Not sure why Yelpers are lovin' on this place, but I wholeheartedly disagree.
