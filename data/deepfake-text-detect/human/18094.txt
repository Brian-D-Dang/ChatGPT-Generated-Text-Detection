I do not feel that the Captain did anything wrong morally. He has no moral duty to sacrifice himself for the people on the ship. There is a post on the front page now about a women who stayed on the ship and saved people while the captain got off. That is without a doubt admirable and I'm sure there were many people like her, and they should be given all the praise in the world. However, the Captain shouldn't be insulted etc for simply saving his own life. In regards to the legal side of a captains duties, I do not know if it includes staying on the ship and being the last man off. If this is the case, then this rule is wrong. CMV
