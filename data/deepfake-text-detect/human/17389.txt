Since the risk of a nuclear disaster cannot be guaranteed to be nonexistent, we should avoid the use of nuclear power as an energy source. We should instead invest in other renewable energy sources like solar, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric. They have considerably smaller associated hazards. Regardless of the fact that the Fukushima Daichi disaster, Chernobyl, and Three Mile Island were the result of human-error (for whatever the reason), accidents happen and nuclear disasters have severe long-term consequences. We cannot control for all possible risk factors such as poor regulation maintenance, natural disasters, or even terrorist attacks. As a result, the potential risk of nuclear energy outweighs that of other renewable energy sources. As an added note, this does not mean I am advocating for the use of coal or any non-renewable energy sources. I'm just interested in comparing the viability of nuclear and the other renewable energy sources. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
