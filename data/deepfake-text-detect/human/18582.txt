Recently, Shia Labouf did an art installation where he invited people to come and do whatever they wanted to him. He laid out various utensils, some pleasant and some unpleasant, on a table in front of him, and put a bag over his head in a room of complete privacy. He could have stopped it at any moment, and chose not to. He also gave (some form of) explicit permission for the person to do as they pleased. The fact that he is using the same word to describe this as forced sex using violence or drugs is, to me, appalling. Rather open to hearing other sides of this, though, so please change my view. Link: EDIT: Because of all the comments saying "Not saying no doesn't mean yes" I agree. However, he did more than not say no. He made the exhibit inviting people to interact however they choose without restrictions. That is the point of his exhibit. He DID say yes, to anything. EDIT 2: A lot of people are saying that the point was not to use any of the items on him, and consent of any kind was given. I can't find the original rules for the exhibit anywhere, but this is an interview with ellen where he seems to imply that he was absolutely ok with more than just talking to him...
