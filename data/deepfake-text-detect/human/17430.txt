Speaking at Mandela's funeral, President Obama admonished leaders who do not "tolerate dissent from their own people." From this and other speeches, it is clear that he is not including himself in this group of intolerant leaders. I find this statement - and many others offered by the US regarding the freedoms and rights of citizenry of other nations - to be condescending and hypocritical. The US positions itself as a world leader in upholding democracy and respecting civil liberties and human rights. For whatever reason, the US has bestowed on itself the moral authority to criticize the operations of other governments. For example, the US government will provide moral support to protests in other countries, and will silence protests occurring in the US. The US government will recognize and provide financial and sometimes military support to rebels in other countries who challenge corrupt systems, but will ruthlessly censor and prosecute US rebels who bring corruption to public attention. There are more examples, but you get the point. I believe that the United States is not a world leader in democracy and human rights. It wants to believe that it has the moral authority to lecture other leaders on how they run their countries; it does not. I believe that, contrary to what Obama said today and what the US government has been saying for years, it does not tolerate dissent. Change my view. FWIW: I'm not a US citizen. Obama was lecturing my government.
