I believe that there is no such thing as a purely straight or purely gay person, and that everyone is at least somewhat bisexual, but refuses to admit it to themself (due to religious, cultural, or other reasons). Sex is sex and should feel good no matter who it is with. Even though men have penises and women have vaginas, there are sex toys which sexual partners could use that would accomodate for any missing genitalia. Love is love, and there should be no barriers on who you fall in love with, either. It is impossible for someone to only be able to fall in love with members of one sex because personalities are not exclusive to sex; thus, any person with an attraction towards a certain personality should be attracted towards that personality within any gender. Please CMV! EDIT: My view has been changed by a few users, and now I no longer am rooted in believing that everyone is bisexual, and am open to believing that people can be perfectly hetero- or homosexual! Thank you everyone who contributed to the discussion!
