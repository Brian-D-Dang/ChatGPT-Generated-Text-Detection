In the original Star Wars trilogy Darth Vader is eventually redeemed by slaying the Emperor at the cost of his own life to save his son. Alas the prequel trilogy shows us that as Anakin Skywalker fell to the Dark Side he murdered a bunch of kids, to me this makes the future redemption impossible. As the original story arc was one of my favorite stories from childhood I would love to still be able to love this character and story. However I have had no luck reconciling it. So fellow nerds, if you can: Change my View. EDIT Due to the excellent reconceptualization's offered here, my view is changed. Thanks! Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
