Let me preface this by saying that I am not a neuroscientist and my knowledge of this field of limited. Yet I have always vehemently (perhaps fallaciously) argued with people who claim that consciousness cannot possibly be a result of biology, and greater metaphysical notion of the soul must explain its existence. I maintain that our consciousness is simply an expression of biology, and that there will come a point in time at which our understanding of the brain will catch up with our understanding of the rest of our body. At this stage, we would be capable of creating consciousness similar to our own. I believe that our current inability to explain the nature of our self-awareness is rooted in ignorance of our biology. I have no concrete scientific knowledge on which I rest my argument besides the fact I cannot see a reason to believe that a metaphysical explanation is necessary. This ignorance about the brain is comparable to people in bygone era's being unaware of how our bodies functioned. As developments in anatomy allowed us to map each blood vessel in our bodies so to will neuroscience map each neuron in our brain. This is a difficult existential idea to tackle, and is an uncomfortable position to hold as it indicates a lack of true free will and the existence of determinism, which in turn has implications on our ideas of morality. I look forward to some enlightenment on my perhaps ignorant ideas reddit! Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
