Let's face it, next to no one uses the upvote and downvote system the way that it is intended. Rather than continually preaching "THAT'S NOT HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO USE THE VOTES, THEY AREN'T AGREE DISAGREE BUTTONS," why don't we just eliminate the downvote? I feel that it would be beneficial in combatting the hivemind that frankly seems to only be getting worse. It's especially frustrating considering I hold significantly differing opinions than most Redditors, and getting downvoted for contributing to a conversation, but being disagreed with. It's not an issue of karma, it's an issue of legitimate opinions not being heard due to the "downvote to disagree" mentality. There's also the odd phenomenon which occurs in the snowball effect of upvoting and downvoting. Seeing a post that already has a slanted number of votes significantly increases the likelihood of voting based on the votes that it already has, because of the positive or negative connotation that the votes put in your mind before actually processing the comment. I'm not too stuck on this view, it's just a thought that I've had the past few weeks and I'd love to hear the counter-points. Thanks
