This boutique was one of my absolute favorites! I used to always shop here when I was trying to find a cute outfit for a special night out. I was so sad to see the actual store front close. Although I guess they are still online- that seems to be the direction many clothing stores are headed right now. I think the Hilton Village is doing a complete remodel because many of the stores there are all closed right now. I did find out that their other location Sherre's up in Cave Creek is still open so I will continue shopping there!
