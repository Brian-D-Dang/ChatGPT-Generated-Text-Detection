In scandinavia we speak more or less the same language. We have the same culture and the same history. One can travel in Norway, Sweden and Denmark as one like. We have the same type of government. Make more or less the same political decisions in foreign aswell as national politics. In fact we have been one country in the middle ages. We are already more or less the same country. I see only two non-nationalromantic reasons that scandinavia isn't a unified country. (by nationalromantic reasons i mean eg. that one can think: I feel like a dane, not like a scandinavian so we should not unify.) 1) Norway have a resource of oil that the others is without. Therefore could the norwegians think that they should stay by themselves. 2) Denmark and Sweden are a part of the european union and Norway isn't. Therefore norwegians could be afraid that there were forced into the european union. On the plus side: 1) Scandinavia will get a larger voice in international politics and economics. (UN, NATO etc) 2) Trade between countries will be easier and we will get more wealth from each other. The way I think i should work is that Denmark, Norway and Sweden should be regions in the same country like the states in the USA. Where the capital should be is for me irrelevant. The minor differences in language will be removed over time if necessary. I'm dane (and scandinavian; by the way. Maybe you have some argument that i haven't thought of. Edit: A counterargument i didn't wrote in the first time: 3) There would be bureaucratic costs. If the population of scandinavia doesn't agree with me, which they don't at the moment, we would at least need more collaboration between the states. In fact there is already a functional counsil for the three countries called Nordisk Rad (Nordic Counsil).
