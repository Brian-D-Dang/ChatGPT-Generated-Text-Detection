Organisms achieve better health when living in a controlled environment with stable source of food, well-adjusted temperature and humidity, without danger of predator and parasites, and provided with medical treatment when ill. Because animals, especially large mammals, has high cognitive function, it not only better for them but also morally preferable to put them in these artificial environments when we have the ability to do so. Just think of yourself backpacking in nature, and compare that to living in a house with AC. Letting an animal starving outside in the rain is definitely worse than bring them indoor and feed them. I also believe that when activists protest about raising animals in captivity, they don't have a case unless they can provide evidence that that particular artificial environment they are complaining about is indeed worse than natural habitats currently available in terms of how they affect the animal's physical and mental health. Yes, I know you can't keep dolphins in a small pool. That's why I say properly designed. I also understand it is not economically and ecologically feasible to implement this on all animals. Non the less I believe it is desirable, and we should do it whenever we have the power to do so. EDIT: Sorry guys, being a new to this place, I forgot the rule that I should respond in 3 hrs. EDIT2: I'm reminded that animals living in unhealthy and dangerous environment might actually have fewer chronic diseases, which is an idea I do believe based on what I'd read in human ergonomics. However I suspect I can circumvent this issue by emphasizing on "properly designed."
