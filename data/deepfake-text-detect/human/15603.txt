Moxie Java is a recently-opened little corporate-style coffee shop with a small lunch menu and some deserts. Consider it Starbucks (plus) better coffee variety than Starbucks, wider menu, and wider selection of desserts. Let's get the important details out of the way: thumbs up on the coffee. They brew multiple varieties of coffee light roast, medium roast, dark roast, and flavored. It's nice to have a choice downtown (since workers have been stuck with the burnt swill put out by Starbucks for year). They also carry frozen, blended coffee and the barista will make a tasty mocha or latte. Prices are pretty much Starbucks level (2.25 for a medium cup of coffee). It's nice to have a sittin' place downtown. The ambiance is corporate comfortfake hardwood floors, wooden chairs, fake fireplace. The place is clean, the tables have space to work, and there's a few comfy chairs to sit in and read. A plus is the free Wifi. The food ain't bad. The bakery products are freshthe muffins are tasty (they'll also offer to warm it up for you). There's a light lunch menu too (wraps, bagel sandwiches). I've had the club wrap and it's pretty well put together (bacon: crispy. turkey: fresh. lettuce: fresh). They have a daily soup as well: decent-enough. The real score with this place is that they offer gelato. Ice cream for lunch! Score! It's nice to have another cafe downtown. There are few enough places to get food.
