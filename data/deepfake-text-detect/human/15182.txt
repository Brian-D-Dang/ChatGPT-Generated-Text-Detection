Quite honestly, the reason that I am a fan is that they have a lot of pool tables, they offer free pool on certain nights, and the bartenders, male or female, are always awesome. PLUS, I get this humongous beer for 2.50 during happy hour with my PT card. Or free if playing 5 quarters. Can one really beat this? Okay, maybe, but I still love this location of the PTs. The food is okay, but what do you expect? It's a bar.
