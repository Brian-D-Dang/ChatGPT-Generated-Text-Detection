Women are and always have been the selector of what semen impregnates them, except in cases of true forced rape resulting in pregnancy. As the selector of the sperm women have chosen dominant men who are not afraid to push the envelope to initiate sex and even get a little rough. Women do not seek out submissive men to have sex with. There are even many women with rape fantasies and pain fetishes (choking, slapping, etc) are so common they might not even be fetishes. Despite what they say, women as a group have a genetic need to be physically dominated and they enjoy it as much as they need it. This also explains why women stay with men who beat them.
