I live in the UK and I believe that we spend around 34 million per year on the project. I can't understand how this can be considered a justifiable way to spend public money just to find out if this Higgs Boson exists or not (we know now that it does exist, but how does that help us anyway). Not only this but I feel that the dangers of the LHC outweigh any benefits, mostly because I can't think of any actual benefits other than giving some scientists a new toy to play with, especially at a time when money is so short and people are struggling to eat.
