Quaise Energy is an MIT spinout that wants to use X-rays to melt rock to create the world's deepest holes and capture geothermal energy. It plans to use a microwave-emitting device called a gyrotron to vaporize rock, removing the need for complicated downhole equipment. Quaise aims to extract energy from pilot geothermal wells by 2026. The company intends to capture energy on a scale large enough to meet human energy needs for millions of years.
