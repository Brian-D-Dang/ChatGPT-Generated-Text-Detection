Standing on a escalator - even if it's to one side so as to let people pass - completely undermines the point of the device. The point of escalators is to increase the flow of human traffic in congested areas. I can't tell you how many time's I've gotten off the subway during rush hour and had to wait an extra 2-5 minutes by the escalators because there's such a huge backlog of people waiting to get up them that can't because they are: 1. waiting for a spot to free up so they can slip in and stand on the escalator, riding it to the top. 2. trying to slip into a spot to walk up like a sensible person but can't because either the entire escalator is blocked by standers, or is so congested that walkers can only get on one at a time. We're at the point that urban planners would be better off just not using escalators any more, because in the end they just end up causing more congestion than they prevent. If you're phsyically disbaled, or elderly, I don't think this applies. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
