To keep it short, I think most of us can agree that at age 18, we are not considered emotionally or mentally developed enough to be called true adults nor have we developed into the person we will be for the rest of our lives. Neurological studies prove that the brain is not fully mature until the age of 25-29 years old, so the potential for a couple to marry at 18 being perfectly happy with each other as people could change by the time they are 30. By that time, their brains are now different, which means personality has changed and it is likely that they are no longer compatible. I believe that if the marriage age was raised, many divorces could be prevented. Brain maturation source. EDIT:Well this has been interesting, but I think this has been fleshed out enough. I'll give deltas to the best debaters as I usually do.
