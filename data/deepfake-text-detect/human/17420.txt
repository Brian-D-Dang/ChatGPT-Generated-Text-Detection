I don't know enough about Life insurance to explain it to him, or to help him see the reason behind it. He is unsure why anyone would want to use Life Insurance, or how it is beneficial. He believes it would be better to keep his money in a savings account for the future. I have tried to play devils advocate and convince him, but I feel my lack of knowledge is holding me back from explaining the full situation, could anyone help us put an end to the debate and help to Change His View? He also doesn't see how Life Insurance companies make their money. So extra information would be great!
