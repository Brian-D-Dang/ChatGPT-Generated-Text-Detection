I was wondering if there are any serious cons to reclassifying ISP's as common carriers. I'm not necessarily interested in arguments against network neutrality (although if there are some good ones, please share them), but rather interested in the negative effects of title II common carriers. I believe the government is pretty good at screwing a lot of things up, but I can't seem to find any solid list of cons to go with the title II common carrier reclassification which every article and post against the recent FCC rule-changes seems to advocate.
