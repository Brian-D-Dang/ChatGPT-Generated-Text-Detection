I follow political news extensively, and it seems that all I ever see is how bi-partisan agreement can never be reached on important issues. The 113th Congress has passed only 15 bills in the past 6 months, in which only 2 were on "major" issues. That's the lowest since the United States has started recording this type of Congressional history in the 1940's. I know that without the two-party system, we wouldn't be a democratic nation, but how do we expect to move forward as a "progressive nation" if our elected senators and representatives are too caught up in "partisan loyalty" and can't look past their differences to do their job, which is serve the citizens of the United States.
