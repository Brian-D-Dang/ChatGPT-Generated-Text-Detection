People who sneeze excessively loud do it solely for attention. Barring a physical defect in the nosemouththroat, everyone can control their sneezes. The only type of people who sneeze loudly are the same type who must be the center of attention all the time. Furthermore they only seem to do it in a quiet, academic environment. I personally have been taught from a young age to attempt to muffle my bodily noises, such as leaving the room if a class or speech is occurring if I start coughing or sneezing. If unable to leave the room, i was taught to muffle it as best as possible to not disturb people. Not only are these loud sneezers doing it for attention, but they are purposefully distracting from any work getting done and making it harder to hear a speaker. TL;DR Loud sneezers do it for attention, and negatively affect situations that require attention or discussion. Edit: Added the word "academic," which I missed the first time around.
