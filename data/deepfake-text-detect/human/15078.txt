No pitchers. What kind of bar doesn't serve pitchers? Given how expensive (and small) the beers are, pitchers would really have helped bring down the cost. If you like beer, want something different, and don't mind paying extra for it, this place is for you. If you don't like beer, don't feel like trying something different, or you do mind paying a lot for small beers, then stay away. The place was dead during the Steelers game, so if you're okay with paying a premium for good seats with good beers in front of good TVs, and don't care for a loudcrazy atmosphere, then this is the place for you.
