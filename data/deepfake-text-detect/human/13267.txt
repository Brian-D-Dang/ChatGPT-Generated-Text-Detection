Dear Haley, Last Thursday you hung yourself. We just thought you were missing. We went searching for you. You were found on Saturday. Everyone who knew you knew that you were a light, illuminating the good in all people. Now that you are dead, the world seems darker. The same halls I used to walk with joy seem dull. Everything that I used to know is being questioned. I hope you found the relief you wanted. I hope you are in a better place now. I know you were a Christian. I know that you were smart. You always had the best grades in class. Mrs. O. loved you. The class seemed dead today. Your desk was covered in roses and letters. The fact that you are gone hasn't hit me yet. On Wednesday I remember borrowing your pencil. I wish I had seen the pain in your eyes then. I know from experience that a small gesture could have made all the difference. None of us know why you did it. You hurt a lot of people. The class was only half full today. Most people were at the grief councillor. I'm worried for some of us who were closer to you. I want you to know, if anything that you were a beautiful human being. I would have loved to learn more about you, know you more, but now I can't. Shine on Haley. -Will
