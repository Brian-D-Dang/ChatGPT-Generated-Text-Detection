This one is a bit of a difficult grey area for me, but I get very uncomfortable when I see people excessively supporting their countries troops to go to war. I absolutely disagree with war (like many people do) but more so I see today's wars as nothing more than countries such as the US and UK (my country) exploiting smaller countries resources, such as their oil. Basically, I believe most of the wars that those countries are involved in have nothing to do with defending from terrorism, or taking down horrible dictators etc; they are involved for profit. I feel that groups such as the Taliban exist because nations such as the above invade and exploit countries in the middle east. I believe that people who glorify their country going to war are hopelessly brainwashed by mass media, being that they believe in systems such as this that only every keep the big guys (governments, corporations etc) on top, whilst exploiting the little countries and forcing them into poverty. I absolutely understand paying respects to those who fought in the World Wars and similar battles, but not for the current campaigns that the UK and US are involved in. But I may be completely wrong. I don't feel as though I know the full details of both sides and that's where you guys come in. Change my view.
