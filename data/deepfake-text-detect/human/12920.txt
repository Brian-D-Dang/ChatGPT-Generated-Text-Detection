It had begun as sort of a..... ok well begun isn't a word that really fits here. We the sentient beings of this universe stand here on the cusp of fate, along with the lesser creatures. In the end..... despite all our advanced. The ability to time travel, ending the aging process, an effective global conflict resolution and our increasingly potent knowledge pool we still have more to learn. The question of why still exists, when all the quantum depths were explored, after we saw from the outside not as an observable subject but as an observer through the connected gate ways of a thousand planets and after we destroyed every last remaining religion faded into oblivion when faced with countless sciences. Why? We now know that there never was space or time, while we can not communicate with others that appear to come before. We know that all we see and experience is nothing but an illusion, a projection of small..... small ripples. Or what ever they call them at the institutions. Why can't we just go back in time to fix everything? because today the universe ends for everyone. Every ripple will now cease. For us it ends today for them it ends in their today. What I am trying to get at is that despite what may seem like a rapidly changing landscape with towers of privilege and low towns of ignorance, it was all even ground. Why? The philosophers revolted eons ago when the question stopped being asked. Then we silenced them because we thought the answer was still out there, the truth had still yet to make its appearance. I see now that the truth was here all along and the question was not why but what? What is the question? In these last hours before the stars run out and the last of our fuel reserves run out ask your self, what was the question?
