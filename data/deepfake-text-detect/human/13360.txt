Captains Log Star Date: 2456 It is my first encounter on this hot planet. I can see vegetation unlike anything I've seen before. Everything seems brighter and more colorful. There is grass but it is a green unlike any green I've ever seen on any other planet. I have been marooned here by Senator Gyron. The worm hole he sent me through has put me on the other side of the universe. I feel a slight ache in my muscles any time I eat these strange colorful fruits. I will somehow build a machine that will beacon my presence among my army that are scanning the stars as we speak. But where do I begin? There are 4 suns rotating noticeably and incredibly close to the horizon and the immense gravity is making me feel heavier than ever. The gravity may alter the signal of the beacon. The atmosphere is dense and I can feel myself getting stronger! I can run great distances, which will hopefully allow me to run off any alien predators that will want to use my skin as a prize. The liquid water appears to be made from some sort of methane combination. I better not start a fire anywhere near it. I will climb that large tree nearby the methane falls and find my slumber and tomorrow I can begin finding materials for my beacon. Captains Log Star Date: 2622 I have now aged 200 years. I seem as though I have not aged a day! My wife Sidrion is making my favorite Kabulin while my children build our other housing unit 600 miles away. Although they have 4 legs and six eyes, I look onto them as Gods of my planet back home. I would never give this up. I am of this planet now. It is fate.
