Three of us gals celebrated our birthdays here, what a great decision. None of us had ever painted anything other than walls or stick people. We worried for nothing, the instructor gave such clear step by step directions. We were assured that there almost nothing we could do that would ruin our painting, and she was right! We were all treated to a wonderful little birthday dessert that tasted like a little piece of heaven. We didn't know they served food and had eaten prior. Next time we'll try something from the menu. A good time was had by all, we will be back.
