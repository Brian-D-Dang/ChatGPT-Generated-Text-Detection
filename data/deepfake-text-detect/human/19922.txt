Before the 1980's, BAC limits were very high, some upwards of 0.15. Many people (myself included) agree with MADD and SADD that these needed to be lowered. Currently, all states use the 0.08 limit, but the National Safety Transpiration Board is trying to lower that to 0.05. I think the pendulum is starting to swing too far to the other side. Also, in terms of statistics, a crash is considered "alcohol-related" if the driver is BELIEVED to have had a BAC of 0.01. Can alcohol truly be a factor at that low of a level? For me, a 250-lb male, that's 2 beers in 1.5 hours. Anyway, CMV.
