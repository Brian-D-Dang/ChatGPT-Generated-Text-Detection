My part was picking up a pencil. Simple as that. Because I picked up the pencil, the person somewhere behind me in the hallway, who would achieve lasting world peace later in life, didn't slip and break their neck. Because I picked up that pencil, I was able to give it to a peer, who would share it with others until the person who would grow up to find the cure to cancer received and kept the pencil. It's pretty cool that the one small action amounted to a cure to cancer and world peace. Still, it would've been cooler if I was the person to find the cure to cancer.
