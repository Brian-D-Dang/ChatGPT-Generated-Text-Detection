A horse's weapons are inherently dependent on it's size. They can trample the shit out of you, and that's about it. Make them small, and I don't feel that they can do much. One duck, however, is already pretty scary. That motherfucker can bite you, anywhere. A gigantic one would probably have enough force behind its bite to one-shot you. Yikes. I don't think you could compare.
