I believe that the easiest way to solve a number of American society's ills is to provide guaranteed housing, specifically via eminent domain of vacant properties. According to a [2012 study] , there are approximately 14 million homes vacant year-round in the United States. I'm proposing that the United States government use eminent domain to acquire a number of those homes, let's say 5 million for the purposes of this CMV. I propose that these homes be provided at low- or no-cost. I'll list what I define as "Society's Ills" for the purposes of this CMV, and how they would be affected. Involuntary homelessness: I specify "involuntary" because there are always going to be people who are homelesstransient by choice, and I feel that we should respect that. However, by providing people with a home, we are providing them with much more than shelter. We are providing them with a permanent address that they can use to get a job, and to get back on their feet. And if people have a mental illness, we're providing them with a stable environment and the ability to receive consistent medical care. Food financial insecurity: One of the largest expenditures for a large percentage of the population is on rent. In some cases, rent can approach 50-75 of a person's budget. Depending on a person's monthly budget, that can come at the exclusion of necessities such as food. By providing either rent-free or low-rent housing, we would be providing the ability for people to become more food-secure, and to possibly put money away for later. CMV.
