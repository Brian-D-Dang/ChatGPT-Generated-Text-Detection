My logic is simple. There are no "travel restrictions" on capital, you can basically invest it in any capital hungry investment around the world. But labor cannot freely travel internationally to where it is needed. This is a huge advantage the capital class has over the labor class, and exacerbates the rich get richer phenomenon in today's globalized economy. Indeed, the attractiveness of many foreign investment opportunities is cheap labor because labor in that country has no where else to go. When labor does find a way to travel, it is often exploited. Illegal immigrants are often exploited because their illegality excludes them from legal protections for labor. Service workers in countries where it is easier to migrate for work (such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Gulf States) have their right to stay (work visa) and even right to leave (exit visa) controlled by their sponsors, leading to epidemic amounts of exploitation. The only justification for these rules is that the social fabric and institutions of certain work immigration target countries cannot absorb large populations of foreign migrants. But this could be addressed with open immigration policies that take steps to mitigate such negative externalities (yearly quotas, target skill sets, etc). I expect xenophobia is the chief reason behind today's restrictive immigration policies.
