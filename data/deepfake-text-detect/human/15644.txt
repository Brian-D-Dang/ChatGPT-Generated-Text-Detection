Reserved the room for our honeymoon from Sunday to Friday two months in advance. I called to confirm the reservation the day of arrival and requested a bottle of champagne for the room. Was told they couldn't do that, would have to check in first. On arrival we upgraded for our stay. Again asked about getting a bottle of champagne for the room (kind of ruined the surprise, since it was in front of my bride. was told there is one in the ice box in the room that I can charge to the room (not the same). Although the Venetian is beautiful, while walking around kept getting approached by barkers, Hey, where you from?, are you going to see any shows? what kind of phone do you have? You won!, come and get your free prize...after you sit through a time share program. Felt like I was in a flea market. On Monday we made an appointment at the spa for Tuesday. They took a imprint of my credit card to reserve the time slot. Monday night my bride found out that they run a special starting Tuesday. when we went to our appointment she requested the special rate. Was told that they couldn't do that because the way the computer works, ended up paying the full rate. Never will I stay there again, as a guest of this establishment I didn't feel welcomed nor appreciated for my patronage.
