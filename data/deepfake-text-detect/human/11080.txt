Can somebody explain to me how supernovas can "explode" given that space is a vacuum? A conventional explosion is generally an expansion of gas caused by a chemical reaction, something which being in a vacuum wouldn't prevent anyway. Explosives typically contain their own oxidizers as the rate of the reaction is too high to pull it from their environment. Supernova however are caused by nuclear fusion which releases vast amounts of energy, pushing particles apart with a velocity which overcomes their attraction from gravity. These nuclear reactions do not require an atmosphere.', "It's important to remember that stars aren't balls of fire that require oxygen to burn. They're balls of hydrogen being fused into helium, and. That fusion is what is producing the light and heat. When all the hydrogen is used it, it'll fuse helium into larger elements instead which requires more nuclear energy, and so the star begins to grown into a red giant at this point because of the increased internal energy and nuclear pressure. Supernovae happen when the gravitational force pulling matter towards the center of a star is no longer greater than the nuclear force pushing it out from the core. When the nuclear force prevails, it slams against the outer layers of the star, instantly stripping away and ejecting most of its matter in every direction. This matter that is ejected is the supernova, and it's still millions of degrees in temperature so it glows really cool colors for many more years after as it slowly cools down
