Phosolipids consist of a phosphate head and a fatty acid tail. Lipids typically have a glycerol head and a fatty acid tail. The main difference is that phosolipids contain both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions (aka amphipathic), and lipids contain only hydrophobic regions. Phosolipids are kinda like a modified lipid, useful in cell membranes. These are also known as a "lipid bi-layer" because they have two layers of phosolipids', "Just adding onto the previous comments, it is the properties of phospholipids (being both hydrophobic and hydrophillic, thus being able to produce a lipid bilayer) that allows cells in the body to have selective permeability - the ability to isolate, categorize and'store' things in separate'compartments' within a cell (in cell membranes). edit: last parenthesis
