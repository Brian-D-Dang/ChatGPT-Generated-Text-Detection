From what I've read of the Red Pill, it seems mostly like a forum disguising blatant misogyny and sexism as self-help "becoming a man." It's full of pseudo-science and misapplications of evolutionary psychology, and most importantly, an extreme lack of empathy for people in different situations. Ultimately, I think it fosters a very self-centered outlook on life, and encourages polarization of opinions on issues of gender. The view to be changed, then, is this: convince me that the red pill, for the most part, is NOT misogynistic, and I am only perceiving the "loud minority." Hello, users of CMV!
