I am a fan of many sports, and all of them seem to take a lot of skill. But golf has always been the one I hated. It's always been boring to me, and it seems that when compared to other sports, golf takes the least skill. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying professional golfers aren't extremely talented, golf is not easy, but compared to anything else, it's nothing. In every other sport, your skill set has to be very large, and you have to be very good at many things. Baseball for instance; you need to be able to bat, field and run. In soccer, you need to be fast, be able to pass, and shoot. In basketball, again, you need to be fast, be able to pass, and be able to shoot. But in golf, you just have to be able to hit a ball towards the hole, and you can only do that one way. Edit: People have pointed out that there are sports that take less skill, like Frisbee and swimming. I guess I was thinking of the slightly more mainstream sports. But my point still stands, aside from that.
