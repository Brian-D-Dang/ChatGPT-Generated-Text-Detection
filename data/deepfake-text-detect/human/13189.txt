An orange and black cylindrical beast with hints of white on out stretched limbs. Sleek and hard, aerodynamic even, in appearance but soft and fluffy to the touch. Giant half conical shaped receptors moving ever so slightly, waiting for the sound of the door latch, a neighbors voice or even the ice machine. It's midsection rising slowing and rhythmically with a twitch here and there of its short but mighty legs. The spikes of hair protruding from its backside appear to be jagged and menacing but in reality are its best, and most famous feature. This forest of orange fluff leads to a triangular nub, which at the sound of my voice eagerly twitches from side to side. Upon further inspection this beast is harmless and should definitely be much closer to me.
