When you heat things they expand. When they cool off, like at night, they contract.','I lived in a mobile home (trailer). It was made of lots of metal, which expands and contracts more when heated or cooled. I heard lots of noises when the HVAC system came on or off. One piece of metal gets a little warmer, and moves farther than the next. Where they touch, they move a little. It makes a noise.
