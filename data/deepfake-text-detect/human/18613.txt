It seems like people always complain about our current representative democracy and the folks who are in it (Congress), with good reason. The main goal of many senators and representatives is simply to get re-elected, or otherwise help themselves, not to make good decisions for other people. Wouldn't a direct democracy work better? That way, less than half the nation would be complaining on each issue, no? I'm no political genius and I'm not exactly sure how direct democracies work differently than representative democracies on each level (township, state, national), but I feel like it would all work out better if everyone got to vote on each issue. The main problem I see is for a bill like this to pass, it has to get through the HoR and the Senate, which is nearly impossible, since they would basically be signing away their jobs. I still want to know why we haven't tried yet. After all, this nation is "Of the people, by the people, for the people," is it not? So what are the issues holding us back? Keep in mind I don't know too much about the government, so keep it simple if at all possible. EDIT: My sources have informed me that a direct democracy requires people to vote on every issue. I was thinking more of a vote-if-you-want type of thing, sort of like we currently have with elections. That way, we wouldn't be overwhelmed with decisions. EDIT 2: I see some flaws with a direct democracy, but I still see even more with a representative democracy. My view remains unchanged. Give me a solid reason why representative democracy is better for the U.S. than a direct democracy!
