I'm a teenager. High school feels like a large factory with everyone trying to rise above each other. Extrovertive show-offs are rewarded immensely not just by peers but even by teachers. The unpopular are ignored, friends if they become it. Few seem to have genuine personal interest in education beyond that which won't raise their status. I went abroad to a city in Europe a year. I found a culture even more obsessed with being "cool," except everyone was rich and considered partying the primary end in their lives. I realized that popular music, which is louder and lacks variety, is a commercial global industry rather than a genre rooted in different cultures like blues or mariachi, even grunge. Internet and phone culture were inescapable, and its taking the place of traditional culture among youth. Most do not live in places with community, but rather megalopolises. Immigration is out of proportions, and undercuts cultural diversity and community. The world is out of control. EDIT: I'm done there isn't a lot of friendly attitude on here.
