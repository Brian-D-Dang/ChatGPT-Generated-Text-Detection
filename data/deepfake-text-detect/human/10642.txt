First, states do not really do this. Lets say you are the boss of John Deere and you want to sell tractors somewhere else in the world. You hire salesmen hoping to find one who speaks the language where you want to sell your tractors. You communicate with your government to be sure it is legal to sell your tractors. Some US electronic items cannot be shipped overseas. Your salesperson travels overseas and hopefully finds someone to be a dealer in that area. You ship demonstration models to this new dealer. He tries to sell your tractors while maintaining a service department and training natives as mechanics. Many companies become involved. Banks have international branches to handle business like this. States get involved when negotiating the trade deals. Governments agree on low tariffs for imported items hoping to ship products which also have low tariffs. Basically large companies negotiate to ship products such as crops or tractors.
