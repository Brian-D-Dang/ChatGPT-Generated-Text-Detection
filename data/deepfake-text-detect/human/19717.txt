Sure, sex segregation makes a lot of sense for many sportsgames where men might have an advantage due to physiological differences. But chess is purely mental. There is no need for strength, speed, endurance or any other physiological parameter that would give men an advantage. In fact, some women do compete successfully in top flight tournaments with men, something that would be impossible in physical sports. If anything, it seems that "women only" chess events are sexist, because the implication is that women are not as smart as men. Edit: The totality of several posts convinced me that women only events maybe needed for now as a kind of a remedial measure for countering many years of men dominance in chess and the fact that currently women are underrepresented in chess. However, I still believe that an eventual goal should be complete sex equality in chess tournaments.
