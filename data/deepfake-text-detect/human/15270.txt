This is my 2nd favorite hamburger place I have EVER eaten at!.... My food is always perfect! I love the pretzel bun! I would strongly suggest trying the pretzel bun! The sweet potato tots are amazing!!! All of the staff I have meet are amazing, the owners are awesome, and the Kimmy special drink is not only refreshing but almost guilt free. I practice out of a clinic close by so I have even had lunch meetings here! I couldn't recommend Rehab Nurger more!
