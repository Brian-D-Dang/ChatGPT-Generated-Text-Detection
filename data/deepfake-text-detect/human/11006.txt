There would generally need to be some sort of previously agreed upon reference point. And from there it's a continuing series of relative reference points. If our agreed upon reference point is the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, we could pretty easily superimpose a coordinate system over it, and identify most stars with enough precision. Stars do move, but they're generally far enough apart and move slowly enough relative to those distances that it's not a problem over short time scales. Once you've got the star figured out, then it's probably best to come up with some sort of local system for that specifics of that system. I'll be in geosynchronous orbit around the second moon of the fourth planet from the star. There might be a little confusion if the planets orbits aren't easily apparent, or cross or whatever, but there are probably other ways of distinguishing. We've got 8 full blown planets, and a few minor planets in our solar system, and they're generally very different from each other. I'll be around Venus, it's the 2nd planet, covered in clouds of sulfuric acid. Meet me at Neptune, it's the big blue gas giant, you can't miss it.,You always have to define a reference point. It doesn't matter where that reference point is, though it sure as hell helps to have it be something that makes sense, like the center of a planet or star or galaxy. There's no way at all to pick a reference point that isn't arbitrary, though. None at all. You always have to say something like "149 gigameters from the Sun at a polar angle of 7.5 and azimuthal angle of 90" or whatever, and you'd also have to define what you mean by "polar" and "azimuthal" angles since those are arbitrary choices.
