The Apple Store went down for just over an hour on Tuesday and came back with a brand-new look. The new design is filled with cards, similar to Apple's Store app for iOS. There are no new products, and the pages for actually buying products are the same as before. Apple is expecting a busy fall, with a range of new products expected to launch soon. Screenshots of the redesigned Apple Store are available.
