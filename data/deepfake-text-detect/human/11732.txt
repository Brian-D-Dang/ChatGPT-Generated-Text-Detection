Google is partnering with Roomba to make smart homes smarter by using maps of customers homes collected by Roomba. They want to make an integration that will let you say "OK Google, tell Roomba to clean the kitchen." They also want to use the data to make everything in the smart home "more thoughtful" so that you could potentially say "turn on the lights in the kitchen" or "OK future iRobot robot with an arm, go get me a beer." The data will not be used for ad-targeting.
