Uber and autonomous vehicle company Motional have partnered up to provide autonomous deliveries through Uber Eats. A pilot program will launch sometime in early 2022 in Santa Monica, California. Only a curated set of meal kits from selected restaurants will be available. Safety operators will be present in the vehicles at launch. Uber has pursued partnerships with self-driving firms since selling its own self-driving division in 2020.
