People talk of starting a White Entertainment Television channel because blacks of theirs. College students want to start a White-only fraternitysorority because Asians and Mexicans already have them. If there's a Black History month, why isn't there a White History month? I personally feel that people who suggest such things are racists. White people have always had representation, and there's no point to doing things for white people only because that's been pretty much all of human history for the last few hundred years. White history is history itself. CMV. White television is every channel outside of ethnic-specific ones. CMV. College is overwhelmingly white people, any every non-ethnic fraternitysorority has white people already. CMV. White people (I being one, and especially white heterosexual males, need to realize we are privileged over ethnic people, homosexuals, and females because we are the default setting. We are living life on the default setting in a game that is difficult to win when you need to play with different control settings and the odds are already stacked against you from the start. I'm white, heterosexual, and male. I don't need to worry about racial discrimination, being bulliedabused for being a homo, or patronized for being a gender that is societally viewed as smaller and weaker. Therefore, I live a life that is much easier than theirs and it gives me more opportunities for a better life. CMV.
