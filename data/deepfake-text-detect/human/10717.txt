I got this. One I think you are mistaken it is actually a crisping sleeve. The ones that are different are between the croissant crust and the deli crust or what ever other crust there is. The croissant crust is taller (because croissants rise differently) so requires a different size crisping sleeve. Source- I may or may not have worked on this business. Edit- fixed typo','I think you mean cooking sleeve, not cooling sleeve. Microwave ovens cook by causing the water in food to vibrate rapidly, warming it up. Different items require the microwaves to reflect in, while others do not need the same reflective material to cook properly.', "I didn't know anyone even used the sleeves to eat the hot pocket. Just bite off a top corner and a little bite near the bottom and blow in it to cool it down. I'm assuming each hot pocket has its own automated'assembly' line including packaging. No use reprogramming or modifying one of their pizza packing machines until it breaks down or is due for servicing. LPT: Do not bite two holes in the top and blow to cool the hotpocket, unless you enjoy the sensation of your face melting.,My guess would be that they're made in different factories and the sleeves are sourced from different companies.','I'll suggest also that it could be that they change the toolingdies over the years but only as they wear out rather than all of it at once. While a new design might be better in some manner, it's not worth it to replace all of the tooling because the old sleeves still work. That said, they're not "cooling" sleeves but "crisping" sleeves. They're designed to safely heat up fairly hot in the microwave and radiate heat.
