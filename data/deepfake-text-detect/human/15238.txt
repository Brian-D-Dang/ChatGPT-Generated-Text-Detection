I've had better service from a pimple faced enthusiastic kid from taco bell.... we asked for a table on a Wednesday evening and we're told no way possible without reservations, but the bar had full menu service. So we went to the bar. As soon as we asked for menus the bartender asked if we wanted to be seated at a table. We said we already asked and they were booked. She then suggested a high top table at the bar so we took one of those. We waited at it for about 15 minutes before being helped. Once the waitress came over we were ready to order dinner. We then waited about 45 minutes.... no bread.... no waitress.... no nothing! We took the bread off another table that left due to lack of service because we were starving! Steaks finally came out after an hour.... no silverware and overcooked. Big surprise.... my baked potato came out about 10 minutes after I finished my fillet. Not a standard desert, but I was hungry so o gave it a whirl.... pretty much raw. I wouldn't of been happy paying 20 for this shit let alone the 70 ot cost. DO NOT COME HERE! EVER!
