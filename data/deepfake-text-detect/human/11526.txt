This article discusses WebAssembly and its possible future applications. WebAssembly is an intermediate layer between various programming languages and many different execution environments. It can be used to run code from over 30 different languages on browsers, servers, and even on some cars. WebAssembly is portable, universal, fast, and secure. It can be used to speed up JavaScript, execute code from different languages, create plug-in systems, and more. WebAssembly is the future of containerization. It is much faster, smaller, and more secure compared to Docker while providing better scalability.
