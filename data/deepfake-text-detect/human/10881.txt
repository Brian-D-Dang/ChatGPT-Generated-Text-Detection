Functional alcoholic checking in. A hangover is caused by a few things, not the least of which is dehydration. This can cause headaches, dry mouth and fatigue. While alcohol itself does contribute to dehydration, sugar is also to blame. Therefore, someone drinking scotch and soda will most likely not get as bad a hangover the next day as someone drinking rum and coke, or wine. This is also where the thought that mixing alcohol makes your hangover worse comes from. Doing sugary shots in-between beers or cocktails increases the ratio of alcohol to water that you're taking in, and adds a bunch of sugar on top of that. Another factor is that alcohol is a toxin, and your body will treat it as such. This is where the nausea comes from - your body is trying to get the crap out the quickest way it can while your liver is working overtime from the inside. Something else a lot of people fail to realize is that when you feel hung over, you're most likely still intoxicated at that point. I have a breathalyzer that I take with me when I go out to party at friends places, and sometimes it's taken me until 5pm the next day for the level in my blood to be legal again.
