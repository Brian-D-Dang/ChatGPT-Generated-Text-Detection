I don't understand how this became the symbol of Christianity. For centuries it was a device to care out a slow and agonizing death. Edit: I think people are getting the wrong impression, maybe i wrote this up wrong. idk. I just think in all honestly Jesus and God wouldn't appreciate us remembering their legacy through a device used to kill people. Back then I'm pretty sure people were scared to death seeing a group of people bearing crosses walking towards them (I know times have changed, and the people have grew to accept it) that was a death sentence back then. I can understand some answers here but the logic of it is what i don't get. Maybe one day. Thanks everybody for your time and answers.
