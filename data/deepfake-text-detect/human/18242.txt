I don't like to read stories. I find them slow and boring, and I would much rather lie on the couch with some popcorn and watch the movie version. I've had many arguments with my reader friends, who claim that books are "more fulfilling" and that they allow you to "use your own imagination, instead of the director's" - and that they help you calm down and release stress - but I disagree. When I'm watching a film, I can get immersed in it. I can see and hear the characters in front of me - I don't have to constantly think. But with books, there are no visuals nor audio, just plain old text on a page. I find this extremely boring, and can't get immersed at all. Don't get me wrong, I can totally see why some people like books, but I don't see why anyone could think they are better than films. CMV, readers of reddit.
