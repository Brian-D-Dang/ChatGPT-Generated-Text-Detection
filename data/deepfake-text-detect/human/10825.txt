Surface Tension The many holes of a sponge hold water because of a scientific concept known as surface tension. Surface tension is the slight amount of elasticity that exists between the molecules of water that holds them together. Each tiny hole inside a sponge is its own little pocket of surface tension. As you handle a soaked sponge, the surface tension "bubbles" will break and reform inside it.

Lol I think that how it works.
