I have often heard of the parallel between safeguarding from theft and safeguarding from rape. But I think the two issues don't make for effective parallels for the following reason: It claims to address causality... i.e. dress more demurely, decently, appropriately, etc. and you will lessen the chances of being raped. Don't party, be "promiscuous," don't drink, don't get drunk, don't do X. Some of these may be good suggestions in that they work to reduce the likelihood of sexual assault or rape. This is a separate issue. What I contend is that they do not adequately address culpability because they ignore how much the (potential) victim might want to do those things. The freedoms to do these things is something that people have fought a long time for. They are not available in contries under religious law - for example. So these freedoms are held dear. We are comfortable telling people to lock their houses to prevent theft, and people in general do not consider it an affront to their freedoms. But I imagine that in a society where the norm is not locking houses it would be a tragedy if when someone was robbed there was a demand on them to lock their houses. But we would likely be less sympathetic to someone in the current society who wouldn't lock their house because we consider them more responsible. Going from the former to the latter situation would result in loss of a certain freedom. While it is true that some risk might be mitigated - it comes at the cost of freedoms that people hold dear. And it is wrong to not account for this. So it is my position that any advice regarding behaviour modification must adequately address culpability and freedoms or it is at the least inconsiderate advice. CMV.
