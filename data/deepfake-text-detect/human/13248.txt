Through sagging eyes I watched the figure cloaked in shadows approach from the corner of the room where I was held. I had been here for days and days, never knowing the warmth of sunlight upon my barren excuse for a body. It had been an eternity since my last day outside, before I had trusted this evil demon. I knew this was the end yet I welcomed it. I would finally be free. "Why did you do this? I never did anything to you!" My feeble attempt of a scream merely made the man grin. I felt rage now; pure, mind-consuming rage. I never dreamt I would die for no reason. The killer before me raises himself up to his full height and drew out a large hunting knife. It reminded me of the ones my father had used to gut deer. I could see dried blood coating the hilt. My heartbeat quickened. He looked down upon me and simply said "I enjoy it." I had no time to ponder this simple, disappointing answer as he forced the blade between my ribs and into what seemed to be my very soul.
