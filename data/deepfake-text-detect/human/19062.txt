Okay, so. From what I know, when you throw away Styrofoam or other man-made compounds, they languish in the environment for 10,000 years without decomposing. Whereas burning it converts it, presumably, to Carbon DioxideMonoxide, and water. Because of this, I feel that burning it and reducing it to compounds that can be metabolized is, in a way better for the environment. I realize it's a lesser of two evils, but burning seems to be the better option. Furthermore, recycling Styrofoam it isn't really an option in my area; nit even the transfer centers or what have you put it in a separate bin. I do recycle what I can, and here I'm refering to plastics that would just be thrown away. Also, this is on a personal level. I realize if everyone everywhere did this, it would be a bad time. CMV!
