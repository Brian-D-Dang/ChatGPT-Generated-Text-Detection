Non-scientific answer: your brain doesn't appreciate the amount of stimulus it must process with both eyes open. You are not just squinting cuz you're eyes hurt, your eyes are hurting cuz.... your brain doesn't like dealing with what your processing and you squint as a somewhat reflexive response. With one eye closed, your brain is better able to deal. Also, you might note that you often keep the closed eye facing towards the sun, so the other eye is not just receiving 50 of the light, it is now likely getting less than that because the ridge of your nose is blocking some of the direct light.
