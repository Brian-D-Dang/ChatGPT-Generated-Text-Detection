In this contribution we generalize the classical Fourier Mellin transform, which transforms functions f representing, e.g., a gray level image defined over a compact set of R 2. The quaternionic Fourier Mellin transform (QFMT) applies to functions: f - R 2 H, for which f is summable over x R S 1 under the measure d th d r r. R is the multiplicative group of positive and non-zero real numbers. We investigate the properties of the QFMT similar to the investigation of the quaternionic Fourier Transform (QFT) in.
