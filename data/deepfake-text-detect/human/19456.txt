My arguments in protection of my view are: restricting businesses from hiring who they want is a violation of the constitution (freedom of association). It is hard to enforce and creates unnecessary hassles and red tape for business. I believe that hiring is a private decision and it really should not be anyones business why a business hired someone or did not. If it should be illegal for a business to discriminate against prospective employees, then it should also be illegal for people to discriminate against prospective friends, partners, etc.. Note: I am not arguing whether discriminating is wrong or not, I am only arguing whether it should be illegal or not. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
