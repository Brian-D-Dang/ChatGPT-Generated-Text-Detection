He walked towards the large glass window. He was so lonely ever since his wife left him. That day, he had figured a walk throughout town might brighten his spirits; perhaps today he might find a match. The implant on his neck was cool as it had not been used for over a decade. He had entered the aquarium on a whim. He was surprised to find it nearly empty. The people must have gone home for the week as it was nearly Thanksgiving. It was only him and the lone beluga whale; trapped in an endless cycle of loneliness. You have one new match He was shocked. There must be someone nearby. He scanned the room but it was empty. Perhaps someone had walked by into another room, too embarrassed to come face to face with their match. He scoured the adjacent rooms with no such luck, and even ran throughout the entire aquarium. The man was confused: there had to have been someone nearby. He returned to the room he was in when he had gotten his match. There was no one there. The implant was now warm. You have one new match. Would you like to say hi? There was no one there. Perhaps his implant had broken. "Tinder, say hi." Behind the acrylic window, bathed in blue, the beluga whale smiled.
