This boggles my mind. I know that some airlines are different like Southwest because they do not have assigned seats. But why don't people relax until their seating zonegroup is called when you have a reserved seat? It's not like the gate person knows that the boarding tunnel is clear or that the previous zone has almost completed been seated. It just seems more relaxing for everyone to go in a "just in time" fashion versus standing in the tunnel, then standing in the plane and trying not to make the person in front of you who is trying to get into their seat anxious. It's a small thing, but its madness and because we can only fit one lane of people in at a time it seems really inefficient for so many people to be standing around. Edit: I absolutely don't mean that I would only get up the moment I gave a completely clear line to my seat. That's ridiculous and I'm not coming from a point of laziness. It just seems there's a lot more efficient things the airlines can do to make the process faster. Edit 2: (Some reason Now for Reddit didn't succeed in saving this edit) I see that a lot of people have a great need for overhead space that I definitely underestimated. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to give everyone who mentioned this before my edit a but I sure did try. Edit 3: I also apologize to all for not being prompt in responding. Not surprisingly, I posted this just before getting on a plane.
