I see a lot of people posting things on their Facebook that I don't think I need to see, or don't care about seeing. And sometimes I disagree with what's been posted, very strongly. I point out the other side, but more often than not, the other person just ignores the other argument or turns it against me. If there's something being posted that's controversial, disrespectful or just plain dumb, then the other side should be heard. You're posting it in public, so let the public have a say. If you're posting something on your Facebook newsfeed for EVERYONE to see and if you're not going to listen to the other side, you're being a hypocrite, since you put it out there in the first place.
