Came here with my boyfriend and had a great time. Iris was our server and she was fantastic. Very knowledgable and friendly. We ordered the hummus and it was pretty tasty. I got the chicken dish with mashed potatoes, mushrooms, artichoke hearts and Dijon sauce. Not a big fan of the sauce but everything else was fantastic. Andre got the ribeye with veggies instead of the traditional sides and he was very happy with it. He raved about it and told the sever how fantastic it was. Carlos (the owner and chef) came out to our table and talked with us about it and Andre told him again how fantastic it was. We'll definitely be back!
