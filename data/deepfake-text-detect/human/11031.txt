You don't see boring things in museums.," "In the olden days, it took a long time to make something, so it was made well so as not to tarnish your brand or reputation to increase sales through word of mouth. In these days, things are made quickly, and the faster they're produced and the more generic they look (so as to be unoffensive to the masses), the more they'll sell.," "In the past, materials were expensive and labor was cheap. Also, people were poorer in general...something like a chair might be a month's salary. Because people couldn't afford to replace things often, they expected them to last.

If you spent 20 years creating something you would want it to be beautiful.
