American poet Charles Bukowski's epitaph that reads simply "don't try" has had a profound impact on me since seeing it. I've adopted it over the past four years or so as my approach to living, that I do not strive, I do not expect, I simply exist and react to things however I do. Expectedly, I've realized I'm a bit of a dirty old man like Bukowski but I feel authentic. There's a lot of noise out there, however, about leaving comfort zones, about force and so forth. I tend to think this all is just the climate we live in, of egos and control, of this emphatic, white-knuckle grip on the idea of free will and choosing our destiny and that we could fuck our lives up if we aren't striving. I remain unconvinced because despite giving it all a serious chance, I still find the poet's wisdom most convincing, that we trust who we are and not "try."
