I feel this is win-win for everyone involved. Most people end up getting a refund if they file a tax return, so the people who really want the money can spend the time filling our their own custom return. The people who don't want to waste hours and hours doing boring paperwork have the option of skipping all that work. Meanwhile, the government will probably get more revenue from bulk withholding, given that a lot of people would be just too lazy to do taxes. As for people who owe extra taxes due to self-employment or contract work, the government can just start requiring businesses to withhold for 1099 situations. Easy and simple. Schemes like these are already being done in numerous developed countries with great success. I don't see why it can't work in the United States. Hello, users of CMV!
