Basically FM radio is a more conventional radio technology that uses Frequency Modulation techniques to carry sound information to the radio receiver in analog form. DAB radios, which are mostly only used in Europe and Australia, carry radio transmissions in digital form using Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing [OFDM] techniques to carry sound information in binary data form. There are several advantages to DAB including improved reception, better audio quality, the ability to encode other textdata streams with each broadcast, and the ability to carry more radio stations within the same block of wireless spectrum. Since FM and DAB are fundamentally very different technologies, you can't just listen to DAB radio station on a conventional FM radio or vice versa (unless the device is specifically designed to receive both types of radio stations). Also, not all radio stations broadcast using DAB and you will obviously only gain the benefits of DAB radio when you're listening to a DAB station.
