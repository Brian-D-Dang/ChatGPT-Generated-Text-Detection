Crowd flow prediction has been increasingly investigated in intelligent urban computing field as a fundamental component of urban management system. The most challenging part of predicting crowd flow is to measure the complicated spatial-temporal dependencies. A prevalent solution employed in current methods is to divide and conquer the spatial and temporal information by various architectures (e.g., CNNGCN, LSTM). However, this strategy has two disadvantages: (1) the sophisticated dependencies are also divided and therefore partially isolated; (2) the spatial-temporal features are transformed into latent representations when passing through different architectures, making it hard to interpret the predicted crowd flow. To address these issues, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Network (STSAN) with an ST encoding gate that calculates the entire spatial-temporal representation with positional and time encodings and therefore avoids dividing the dependencies. Furthermore, we develop a Multi-aspect attention mechanism that applies scaled dot-product attention over spatial-temporal information and measures the attention weights that explicitly indicate the dependencies. Experimental results on traffic and mobile data demonstrate that the proposed method reduces inflow and outflow RMSE by 16 and 8 on the Taxi-NYC dataset compared to the SOTA baselines. Codes:
