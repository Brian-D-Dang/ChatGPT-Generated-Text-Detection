But how much is actually proven to be a side effect? All those are "possible side effects," meaning you might experience them. Drugs can be difficult to predict and just because someone experienced them in testing doesn't mean you will. because companies are too cheap to do extra testing? Extra testing probably won't help. Suppose 5 of people who take the drug experience anal leakage while others don't. What will more testing reveal about that possible side effect? Does that mean that heart attack could actually be a 10 occurrence and not a.01? Such a dangerous drug would never pass FDA approval.
