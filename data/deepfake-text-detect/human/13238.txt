There is a fine art to foreshadowing. Almost as fine as seduction. Both have numerous tools available to the dedicated practitioner which require different nuances to deploy correctly. Similarly some tools are more refined then others, for instance, posting "netflix and chill" posts on the internet (with pics!). This is the more..... "sledgehammer bludgeoning" method of seduction. Choosing "deadly mating habit documentaries" (Similar to other things you watch!) to watch with her prey she figured to be about as subtle. However this recent'candidate' (victim sounds so..... mean) is making this rather difficult. Black Widow Spiders "Seen it" Mating habits of Praying Mantises "Seen it" The Secret Life of the Venus Fly Trap "Seen it" "OK..... what do YOU want to watch?" This is not the first uncooperative vic..... er candidate she's had. Some times you've got to change up your strategy.'Animal mating habits' is hilariously ACTUAL flirtation for some, and is easily segued into'animals that kill each other before during or after sex'. So basically any nature doc can lead to foreshadowing (and seduction!), sometimes it just requires a bit more conversational acrobatics. Ambush Predators of the Reef "Eh, it kinda drags on doesn't it?" Truthfully, this one always made her uncomfortable. The Reef always seemed so crowded with killers. Birds of Prey: Urban Hawks "I mean, ya, they're majestic, but..." Jeeze, this guy sure can pick'em, this one has a section on the'hunter becomes hunted.' Hunters of the Night: Owl on Bat Predation shit....
