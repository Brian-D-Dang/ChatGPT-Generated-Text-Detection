I'm generally a fan of the away goals rule: it encourages more attacking play, and makes the second leg of the tie exciting when a solitary goal can turn a loss into a win. However, after 180 minutes of even play, I think it's unfair for the away goals rule to apply in extra time. Both teams have had 90 minutes at home and 90 minutes away. It's unfair that the away team in the second leg gets 30 extra minutes to score an away goal. If both teams score in extra time, the tie should go to penalty kicks, not go down as a win for whichever team was playing away from home in the second leg. I especially feel that this is true, because when the draw is seeded, the better team plays at home in the second leg. If anyone is going to be given an advantage, it should be the better seed who earned it with better play in the group stage or qualifying round. So, change my view.
