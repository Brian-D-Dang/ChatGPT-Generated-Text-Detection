That's the Balducci levitation, and he didn't invent it. What he DID do was use special effects and editing to make it look a LOT more spectacular on TV than it is in real life, and in doing so, broke a decades-long rule among magicians to NEVER use FX or editing tricks on TV.,Misdirection. He is actually standing on his toes on the foot away from the observer and blocking their view with the other foot','Unfortunately he also resorted to camera tricks when presenting this illusion on TV. To the people who are there in person, it might appear that he is levitating only a few inches off of the ground. When it is aired on television, the shot cuts away to an edited shot of him being lifted off of the ground by wires much higher than that, making it seem much more impressive.
