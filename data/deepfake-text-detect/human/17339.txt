First off I don't mean I don't like him as a person: I don't know him. I mean that I can't recall a single role he has played where I've connected with him, or thought "wow, I really like this guy." I've enjoyed many movies that he's been in (primal fear, the illusionist, Italian job, red dragon) but I've never actually enjoyed him in his roles. I feel like he is probably a great actor but I'm just not connecting with him. I want to like him, I really do, please help me see him in a new light. Note: I haven't seen American history X and I do not ever want to watch it so please try to CMV with any of his other work. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
