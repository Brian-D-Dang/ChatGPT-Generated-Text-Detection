Democracy is, literally, "rule by the people," as we have all learned in elementary school civics or history. Implicitly, these people are mortal and human, and usually limited to citizens of the state. I cannot think of a single religion which promotes a supreme being with dominion over mankind (such as the God of Abraham, Zeus, Indra, Marduk or the Jade Emperor) whose position of dominion originates from the consent of the governed. In no mythology or religious tradition is any god I am aware of elected, be it by other spiritual beings or humanity, who may or may not be recognized as creations of the god. Regardless of if one believes in the existence of one or many godlike beings, acknowledging them as having control of the fate of humanity undermines the absolute underpinnings of democracy and republicanism, values which are at their heart literally humanist. I am open to any and all arguments from any religion that purports a spirit with dominion over mankind, not at all limited to Christian theology. Hello, users of CMV!
