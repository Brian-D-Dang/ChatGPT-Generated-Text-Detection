You turn to face Death, a small hermaphrodite figure with the face of everyone you've ever loved. They smile and you feel all at once safe and very, very afraid. They speak and Death's voice echoes the same sentiment as their face; a curious blend of the voices of everyone you've ever loved. "Pick a game, any game, and if you are the victor, I'll send you back to the day before the accident." says Death. Among the myriad of faces flashing before you one clings to your memory. Your late Grandmother's face, a clever woman, a sharp woman. Her face held her patented knowing look and mocking smile. The fear leaves you, quickly replaced by courage. You know what to do. "Any game?" You ask. Death nods their head. Grandma's face flashes at you again, an all-knowing smile spread wide. You pluck up your courage "I choose life."
