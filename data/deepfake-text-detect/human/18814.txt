I can see the reasoning behind vegetarianism for economic or ethical reasons, but not for health reasons. Given that meat is not always unhealthy (e.g. it's a good source of protein and minerals, a way to gain satiation without having to take in lots of carbohydrates etc), it strikes me as odd why people choose to be vegetarian solely for health reasons. Why limit the forms of nutrition you intake? Committing to not eating meat can be quite difficult when starting out, so it would at least be as easy to formulate a good, balanced diet plan that includes the benefits of meat, no? Please CMV.
