First I want to say I didn't come here by choice. It was my boyfriends fathers birthday so he chose where to eat. I haven't personally been to Hamada in forever but it was exactly how I recalled it. Big, slow, decent food, expensive. Atmosphere: 45 You walk in this place and you feel like your in Japan. I liked the decor a lot of fake plants with a Japanese sand box in the middle (it was actually a rock box but I figured food kids dust everywhere). The lighting was very dark it helped disguised the fact they barely had anyone there. I was there about 6:30 prime dinner hours and that place was EMPTY. Sashimi: 35 was delicious.... fresh big chunks. They better be for the price! For an assorted boat of sashimi was 40 bucks. I basically inhaled it Nigiri: 35 Great portions big fish and good amount of rice. I really liked their rice with the nigiri. It was a bit sweeter than most places. Shrimp Tempura Boat: I'm not a fried food type of person but my boyfriends little brother loves Shrimp tempura. I can't give you a good opinion on shrimp tempura because I'm already bias on the friend part. Teriyaki Chicken Entree: 05 I was so surprised how SIMPLE and HORRIBLE this dish was. I literally could've gotten better Teriyaki chicken from PANDA EXPRESS. The presentation was even horrible. A scoop of rice, teriyaki chicken, and edamame Seaweed Salad: 05 What a rip off, this seaweed salad was mostly cucumber salad. They should call is cucumber salad with a dash of seaweed. What a joke... Service: 55 Service was great, your waitresses are really nice and they get into character so well. Dressed in Japanese kimonos Price: 05 Super expensive for 3 12 people our bill came close to 300...and I was still hungry after.
