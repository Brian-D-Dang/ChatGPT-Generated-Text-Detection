Every month or so, we hear about a tragic story of a hiker attacked by an animal (usually a bear) while they are out in the wild. Often times, the animal is unprovoked. But sometimes an animal's instincts will overtake it, and it will perceive a hiker as a potential threat to either it or its offspring. Whenever an attack on a human happens, park officials from wherever the incident occurred place traps to catch and euthanize the animal. I don't think that animals that attack hikers should be killed. I love the National Park System, and everything they do, but I just don't think that it is appropriate. The NPS was created for the purpose of being preserved. With that preservation comes the opportunity for us as humans to enjoy them in their uttermost beauty, but that doesn't mean we should start altering them for our convenience. Yes, wild bears can be dangerous. They're BEARS for heaven's sake! But their habitat isn't ours to make our own. Part of hiking through these parks, whether it's the Great Smoky Mountains (where the North America's largest density of black bears reside) or Yellowstone National Park (where a grizzly killed a hiker just yesterday), wild animals are going to be wild. The national parks are to be preserved, not to be altered for our enjoyment.
