From what I understand, fines levied against corporations for violating laws and regulations are so paltry that corporations can break many laws without much worry, since the additional profit gained far outweighs the costs in fines and legal fees. In effect, this puts them above the law. I believe that fines should be relative to the profit gained from breaking the laws. That is, if they make eg. 100,000 from breaking some law, make them pay 1,000,000 in fines. If they make 10,000,000, fine them 100,000,000. That'll make them think twice before doing it. If I'm wrong, CMV.
