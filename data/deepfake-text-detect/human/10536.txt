There's a field of energy that exists everywhere in the universe. Even in the emptiness between planets in outer space, there is a little bit of energy. Imagine that all of our physical laws "rest" on this field of energy. It is the bottom-most foundation of all matter. What the article suggests is that this field of energy might not be the true bottom. It might be the case that the TRUE bottom-most foundation of our universe is a field of far less energy. It might be the case that in billions of years our local field of energy will fall apart, and the TRUE bottom field wouldn't be strong enough to support our physical laws. LYF: Our universe is a house resting on solid ground. Now we find out there might be a sinkhole underneath the ground our house sits on. In a few billion years our "solid ground" might crumble into the sinkhole, which means our house would also crumble. You'll be dead long before then, though, so don't panic.', "Stuff is made of molecules. Examples of molecules: Water (H2O), oxygen (O2), sugar (C6H12O6), etc. Molecules are made of atoms - the elements of the periodic table. There are over a hundred different elements, hydrogen being the lightest. Atoms are made of a nucleus and an electron shell. Electrons are elementary particles. The nucleus is made of neutrons and protons. Neutrons and protons are made of quarks, which are elementary particles. The article suggests that, based on new discoveries about the Higgs field and how quarks interact with the Higgs field, in the distant future, quarks might become so unstable that they'll no longer be able to form protons. That means all protons in the universe will decay and matter will no longer be able to exist.
