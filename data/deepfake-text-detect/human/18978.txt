The cop in the donut shop is a stereotype, but it unfortunately rings true far too often in my opinion. An overweight cop puts himself in danger and puts myself in potential danger. So I think some sort fitness test should be created that cops must be required to pass to remain on the force. I don't know what exactly this test should entail, but I'm sure one could be developed. A few possible arguments I could see being made here... Many cops have desk jobs, so this would be unnecessary. Okay, I'm willing to except certain reasonable caveats. If a cop solely has a desk job, or some similar position where they would never be on the streets with a gun, then fine, he or she can eat all the donuts he wants. Whether a cop is fit or not, the ability for him or her to do his or her job would rarely be affected. But it might be. Cops chasing down suspects might mostly occur in movies, but it does most certainly happen in real life. I don't want an officer who would be out of breath after running a block. Most cops never use their gun either, but they still carry them. CMV. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
