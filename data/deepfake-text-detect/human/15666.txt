XS is a fun club! It's definitely one of my favorites in Vegas! Went here twice last year! (yea my group of friends liked it that much). The music is really good both nights we went, and the crowd was alright as well. It does get pretty packed, but what do you expect? it's one of the hottest spots in Vegas. I'll be coming back by the end of the month!
