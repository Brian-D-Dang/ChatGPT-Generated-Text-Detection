A network of radio telescopes in the Netherlands made detailed recordings of a lightning bolt during a summer storm in 2018. The recordings, which were processed only recently, show lightning starting up inside a thundercloud. They were used to create a 3D image of the lightning. The pattern of pulses recorded indicates that lightning starts with clusters of ice inside of a cloud. An animation of the lightning flash is available in the article.
