Facebook recently launched a new virtual reality remote work app where users can hold meetings as avatar versions of themselves. Workrooms is an early step by Facebook towards building the metaverse that Mark Zuckerberg has been talking about in recent weeks. Other tech CEOs have also talked recently about how their companies could shape the aspects of the metaverse. Facebook has invested heavily in virtual and augmented reality hardware to be less reliant on other hardware makers. The company recently halted sales of its Oculus Quest 2 headsets and recalled the foam face-liners due to reports of skin irritation. The recall affected about 4 million units, providing an estimate of Quest 2 headset sales.
