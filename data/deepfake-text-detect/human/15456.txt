A wonderful Asian restaurant with the stated goal of bringing East Asian cuisine to the East Valley. The menu is a medley of foods from the East Asian bloc - think Thai, Japanese, Malaysian, Chinese and more. There is a seperate meny for sushi and the choices are unlimited. I sampled some sushi, tried one of the soups and ordered a noodle dish with chicken and shrimp and I was extremely satisfied with my choice. I did not try any dessert but, they had this unique cheesecake which looked awfully tempting. If only I had room left in the tank! An added bonus of Oasian is the affable staff. I look forward to coming here in the future and maybe I can try that cheesecake.
