If there are many comments in a row deleted it was almost certainly a moderator who removed them all. I do it all the time here in ELI5. The reasons for the removals are as varied as the subreddits it happens in and the rules of those subreddits.','Mods have to do this sometimes. For example, many subs have a civility rule, it's designed to encourage readers to treat each other decently. But this doesn't always happen, sometimes folks get into arguments and a lot of insults get tossed back and forth. Often a mod will comment on the end, admonishing both parties for being offensive, and will remove the entire chain of the incident. It's sort of a "Hey guys, this isn't cool, break it up, okay?" Sometimes there are heavily moderated subs, like rAskHistorians or rscience. If the comment subjects get way off topic or if they're not serious or relevant to the original post, a mod there may pull the whole comment chain. On some subs, people take it with maturity and see it as their mods doing a good job to keep things on topic and keeping things civil. On other subs, readers cry "censorship!" and will loudly decry their mods for removing content, regardless of what it is. It depends on the reader, a blank comment is ripe for any reader to impose their own meaning and perspectives on it.', "As others have said, this usually means a mod nuked it. As to why, as a frequent user of this technique, usually the reason is because an entire exchange breaks the rules. If one comment is off-topic, the whole chain will be. If one's rude, usually there's a rude back-and-forth. If a conversation is devolving into stupid arguing, nuking the whole thing puts a more effective stop to it than pruning the worst only to have it return.
