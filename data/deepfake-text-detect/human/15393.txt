This place is a 4 star hotel and lives up to it. I didn't like the fact that they charge a resort fee for internet and gym access...its not even optional, its mandatory. If its mandatory why don't you just add it to the price of the hotel room initially and not sneak it on?? That was messed up, luckily its only 20 a night. Service was good, there wasn't a horrific line to checkin like some of the other vegas hotels. The rooms were clean and the technology in them was pretty cool. I would stay here again.
