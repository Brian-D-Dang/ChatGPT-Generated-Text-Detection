Generally you'll NEVER see this during a pre-recorded show (if you do, someone really screwed up their job). Commercials are sold in blocks of typically 5 seconds, with 5 and 10 being fairly rare, but 152030 common, and 60 also being semi common. In a recorded show, everything is timed out to the fraction of a second. In a recorded show, your local TV station is given the runtimes of the show (currently around 17-20 minutes for a 30 minute show), and given the number of national commercials (and the tape for those commercials), and allowed to fill the rest with local commercials. Each day or week, someone will cut, or edit, the commercial blocks for each hour that the station is responsible for broadcasting the commercials for, and the station switches to that tape when it's required. However, on a live broadcast, things get a little bit more tricky, because while everything (such as a news broadcast) is timed out to the second as well, things don't always go to plan, and things get cut off. Typically, the station will prefer to cut a story or some other facet of the broadcast out, and make sure the commercials air in full, because if they DON'T air the entire commercial, they "owe" that company an equal block of time. However, things are compounded when it's something like a sporting event, that the station can't dictate the pace of. They just need to know how much time they're supposed to have, and ensure that their timing is right. Again, its on them if a commercial gets cut short. source: Studied video production in college, worked at a local TV station', "If it is at the top of the hour, or the half, then the cable company that you subscribe to has probably switched between their own sources for that channel's programming and the two sources were not perfectly in sync.
