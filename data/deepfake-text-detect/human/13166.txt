Her hair was every color of blonde, and was kissed by the waves. It fell just below her shoulder blades. Her face was oval and set in it were grey blue eyes that seemed to have lightning striking her pupils. She wasn't model skinny and her stomach wasn't flat as a board, but she was still mildly attractive. A smile was never far from her face, and when she smiled at you it was like you were her long lost best friend. Her style ranged from t-shirts and jeans to Sunday dresses. She either dressed like the homeless, or she dressed like a business woman. There was no in between. When she spoke it was mostly English, but sometimes she slipped in some German just for the extra practice. Headphones were always in her ears, or music was playing from somewhere. She was always air guitaring if she didn't have her real guitar in her hands.
