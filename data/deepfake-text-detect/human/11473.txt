The Perturb-seq map is the first comprehensive functional map of genes that are expressed in human cells. The data is available for any scientist to use. It allows scientists to explore the cellular effects of genes with unknown functions and it will enable all sorts of analyses that scientists haven't even considered yet. The map was made possible through a technique that can follow the impact of turning on or off genes with unprecedented depth. Examples of how researchers are using the map are available in the article.
