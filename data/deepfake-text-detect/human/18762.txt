Shoelaces are a horribly outdated concept. They come undone very easily, can be tripped on, get loosened and stretched over time, and have the aglets break making the laces fray. They pale in comparison to velcro straps, which are easier to fasten, can be done by people of all ages, and stay closed much easier. Functionally, there is no reason to choose laces over velcro straps, but laces still remain the dominant shoe fastener. In fact, it's almost impossible to find shoes in adult sizes because it's seen as a thing only for children's shoes. One could argue that laces are more fashionable than velcro straps, but fashion trends can change very easily, and if shoe manufacturers started making more adult shoes with velcro, we could wind up with it being considered fashionably acceptable.
