I recently saw a video on why the Republicans [can't win] the 2016 election. If we go by raw numbers, Hillary will most likely win the next election. This got me thinking. Demographics are changing in America. Firstly, Non-whites become a higher percent of the US population seemingly every year. This could be for a number of reasons, like immigration, but it's a good thing for the democrats because non-whites are statistically more likely to be liberal. I don't see this trend changing so I have a hard time seeing how the a Conservative will be voted into office again. Secondly, Conservatives are aging. Statistically, older people are typically more conservative whereas younger people are typically more liberal. The older Conservatives will eventually all die and be replaced by young liberals. I must be overlooking something, or missing some way that Conservatives can get votes in the future. Has a situation like this happened before? edit: view is changed
