"Alright guys, let's get this meeting started," I yelled walking into the capital building. Usually I would get a response, but today - - everybody seemed to talk right over me. "Excuse me..... gentleman..... GENTLEMAN"! My loud cry for attention was overlooked. I felt like nobody was listening. Could I have been exiled out of my own social life? What had I done? My mind flustered with doubtful thoughts. Well on the bright side, this isn't such a bad day. I have dinner with Caesar tonight. Best guy in the empire! And don't get me started on that special salad he makes, you'd think you died and went to the gods. It seemed as though all the senators were arguing over some important guy. Who cares!? I walked over and with no hesitation declared, "Have fun with your'democracy' boys, I'm going to have dinner with the Emperor himself!" The room that was once a Colosseum of shouting and howling became a room of pure silence. "So..... what happened next?" "They put me in this'special waiting room' with you. Dinner with Caesar should be ready in no time!" "I've been in this'special waiting room' for two years." "I'm sure he knows. I just can't wait for the salad!"
