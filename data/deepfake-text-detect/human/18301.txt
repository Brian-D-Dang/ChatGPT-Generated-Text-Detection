Many major events in history have garnered thousands of theories about how they actually happened. 911. The JFK Assassination. These are only a few of the events that have received the attention of the curious and suspicious. I feel that conspiracy theorists are given a bad rap. Anyone that doesn't completely believe in the official events of 911 is written off as "Un-American." However, when these theories, not only ones pertaining to 911, are presented with reasonable evidence, I think it's ignorant to brush them off as "crazy people theories." I feel that some people doubt their government would lie to them. I don't want to get into discussing theories about different events, I know where those go (rconspiracy). CMV.
