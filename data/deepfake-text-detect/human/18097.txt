I never understood the argument that abortion is a women's right's issue or those that oppose it are anti-women. People who are pro-life usually believe that abortion is murder and that to abort a baby is to take a human life. No one has the right to commit murder or take a human life. Even though a fetus is incredibly invasive and intimately effects a woman, a woman can't kill a human being because they are an invasive hindrance. Yes it is their body, but no one has a right to use their body to kill an innocent human being. I am pro choice, but I am pro choice because I dispute the premise that abortion is murder. This seems to me like it is a purely philosophical issue however and has nothing to do with women's rights. The controlling issue is when life begins, not the rights of a woman and her body. EDIT: My ultimate view has not changed but I do not see the issue as black and white or one sided as I did before so thank you. Edit 2: I think part of the problem is I have always taken the issue that in certain contexts letting someone die is different than killing. The hospital hypothetical keeps coming up. My thought is that if someone tried to kill you and they failed, and you needed a kidney to live because of the attempted murder, they should be required to give you a kidney. Or, if they had to be hooked up to you for nine months, they should be required to. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
