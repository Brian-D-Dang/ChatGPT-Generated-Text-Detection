This place might be nice in the warmer weather but the restaurant was freezing and we had our coats on the whole meal. They also left the door open a crack to get the steam out from the kitchen. The service was slow the server was unpleasant and she didn't get us out on time for our show (which we mentioned several times including when we made our reservation). The food wasn't bad but a little overpriced.
