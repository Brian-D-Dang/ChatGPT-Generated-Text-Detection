Studies show that, on average, every extra inch of height is worth 789 per year in extra salary, which can approach wage gaps similar to gender and race. There are a number of height-based stereotypes whether they be explicit or implicit such as short people are angrier, have complexes, bossy, poorer leaders and less competent. This causes shorter people to be passed up for promotions, pay raises, generally receive less social status, and be the butt end of deprecating comments which harm their self-esteem. It's no wonder that research shows shorter people report being less happy. I noticed (especially on Reddit) than when height discrimination issues are brought up that it is laughed at and posts which reinforce heightism and make fun of complaints about heightism receive many upvotes. You would never see that for other forms of discrimination. Due to all of this, I believe that heightism should be taken more seriously as a form of discrimination. CMV EDIT: Here is a great example of how short individuals are devalued in society, without even consciously realizing it. From poster etothepiei: In terms of historical weight, tall good, short bad is definitely ingrained in pretty much every society throughout the world. Specifically, in English, we have phrases like "looking down onlooking up to" somebody. A cowardly man is called "little," a heroic man is called "big."
