Because from the beginning they have been moderating a community they feel strongly about. For example, the AskScience community has done amazing things for the thousands that have received professionalquality help. Moderators do not want to abandon the communities they love. From my understanding, Reddit seems to have this arrogance that their site is only partially successful because of the moderators when in reality, the quality subreddits have amazing moderators that make Reddit what it is. All they want is to be informed of certain decisions to better serve their community and keep the Reddit site financially stable. Edit: spelling and grammar
