We've got the entire country littered with interstate highways and pipelines, why is this land so important? Personally I think the pipeline is good for the environment because it offers a more efficient method of transportation and if we want to discourage gasoline use simply raise the gas tax. On the jobs side of the issue my opinion is it doesn't matter. We've been avoiding printing money to keep the dollar strong discouraging exports killing low wage American jobs for decades, all so that we can get Iphones and T-shirts brought in from third world countries on the cheap. The exact opposite policy of countries like Brazil and China. It helps in the long run by encouraging education despite pissing people off. It's irresponsible to keep an inefficient method of oil transportation because "it kills jobs."
