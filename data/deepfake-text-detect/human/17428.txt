I've always been a huge fan of video games since my youth. I have never been that much in to sports, reading, woodwork or whatever people are doing these days. I started loving video games when I was about five years old. My grandfather gave me a Gameboy advance for my birthday. He died shortly after of lung cancer. When I was young, I played basically in his memory. I loved it, and ever since, gaming has been my largest time sink, and also, my largest money sink. I've gone from GBA, to PSP, to GameCube, to PS3, and am now part of the so called PC master race. Now, I spend most of my free time in my room, in front of my screen, right hand on my mouse and left hand on the WASD keys. My parents believe I am addicted. I do not think so. If given the option, I will always choose to be with my friends over playing video games. Right now, I am supposed to be in the funnest period of my life. I am supposed to be outside "doing things." However, I do not think that I am wasting my life. Playing video games is incredibly fun and stimulating for me and don't understand why it's such a tabooed hobby. Gaming has gone as far as changing my view of what I want to do as a living. I've already made a game as part of a team, and am now working on a smaller one on my own, just for fun. Why is everything the fault of "gamers"? Is it people like me who are prone to school shootings? One last thing, I do not have the physique of a stereotypical computer nerd. I am 6'3" and way too skinny.
