Disclaimer to the NSA: I have not, nor will not partake in any actions of property destruction I'm way too much of a pussy. You and I likely have different definitions of violence. A lumber company destroys huge swaths of landsthat's violence. A bank leaves another family homelessthat's violence. The CIA runs drugs to fund anti-leftist terrorists to overthrow democratically elected governmentsthat's violence. The fracking corporation down the street pollutes our air and destroys the property value of my housethat's violence. The military invades countries in pursuit of "American intereststhat's violence. They get away with it time and time again, and no one stands up to them. No one shows them that this is not okay; that they will not get away with this anymore. When combating massively powerful entities such as these, it is important to have a range of tactics to bring them down. Anything from boycotting, to striking, to street protesting, to blockading, to various forms of direct action. This is why I cannot help but smile a little bit when I see a black bloc smashing bank windows, when protesters block the Keystone Pipeline, or when direct-action groups such as the ELF burn down a logging headquarters. It's refreshing to see that there are some people courageous enough, with enough conviction, that they do take action into their own hands (arguably) for a greater good. Where I lose respect for these forms of direct action is when it begins to harm innocent people. But for once in my life I want to see a town take control and drive out those who are actively threatening the community. While writing your congressman, voting for either the douche or the turd sandwich, and changing your profile picture may give you a smug sense of activism, in the end it will do nothing to change the system. What do you do when you're screaming at the top of your lungs, but nobody even cares to listen? Why shouldn't we take actions into our own hands and hit them wherever it hurts?
