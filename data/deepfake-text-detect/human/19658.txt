I need to clarify that I don't think that overweight people should ever be made fun of, made a joke of, taunted, bullied, or whatever, because of their weight. I'm also not talking about people with genetic disorders in this CMV- the small percentage of overweight people really can't help it. (Also, I'm not using the BMI scale as an indicator of healthy weight because it's doesn't take bone mass, muscle mass, etc.) At the same, I don't agree with overweight people being 'encouraged' of their weight- I know many people say say that you can still be healthy while being overweight. I disagree. Having 40 of your diet consisting of fat is not healthy, no matter how much fruit you eat along the way. No 5'0 girl should be smiling at the camera, saying how they don't care and are happy with their 200 lb bodies, that they have 'curves'. It's not excepting your body as being beautiful, it's excepting your failure to be healthy.
