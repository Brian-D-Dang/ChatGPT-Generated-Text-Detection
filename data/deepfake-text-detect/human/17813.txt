In almost any thread or conversation about ProChoice vs ProLife, a ProChoice person will say that "No one's ProAbortion" or "I personally wouldn't get an abortion but I think it should be a choice." I honestly have no idea how this position makes any sense. Even though I'm 100 ProLife, I can follow the logic of a person who admits to being Pro-Abortion and even (in a sense) respect that that is their opinion. I just cannot grasp why other people always call it "Pro-Choice" when in the end it boils down to Pro-Abortion. Edit: It's not so much an argument about labels as much as positions. How can someone personally be against abortion but identify themselves as prochoice? is a bit more what i mean i suppose.
