It feels like the gay community won't even discuss the litany of issues that are problematic about our current President (in America.). Suddenly, its as though, "Well, he loves gay people, so now he is untouchable, and we can't really talk about the seriously fucked up shit he is doing." I mean, if marriage were really a personal decision involved with loving someone, and not a tax-exempt status, government wouldn't even be involved and this "right" wouldn't be an issue. Since Obama has come out in favor of the LGBT community (which, don't get me wrong, is good.), it just feels like it is exploitation to draw attention away from the fact that he is actually actively taking away real and important human rights from every American. I'm not even sure what could change my view about this. As one of my transgender friends said about this issue when I brought it up to her: "The LGBT community is just as oblivious and uneducated as regular Americans." To be clear: I support the LGBT community and think gay marriage should be legal. I simply feel like the support of the Obama administration is making the gay community and their supporters as blind to their negative aspects as rednecks were to Bush 2's negative aspects. (The aspects of Obama that scare me I don't really need my views changed on...at the moment anyway. Things like the NDAA, and the proliferation of pilotless drones, warrantless wiretapping, and essentially the end of privacy. You get the idea.)
