You chose to take the job. You chose to keep your job. If you don't like it, quit and move on. If you can't find another job, be thankful that you're employed at your current skill level. No one is forcing you to do anything. You can always quit your retail job if you don't like the way things are run. Millions of people enjoy the day after thanksgiving sales (ok...they go to the sales), there is a market for that. Which means there are jobs there. If you don't want that job, someone else does. I've worked my share of holidayslong hours in a job far shittier than retail, its not that bad. Stop being a whiner and accept that you may have to do something unpleasant sometimes.
