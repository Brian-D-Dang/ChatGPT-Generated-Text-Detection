For starters, I live in Europe (Belguim) and Europe has some socialist traits. For example in my country there is unlimited wellfare and the eldery get money from the state until they die. The problem is not that they get the money, but people who go to work pay taxes, pay indirectly for their income, when I'm returning home after work or school during rush hour I see 10-20 elderly people sitting in the tram while the tram is a sardine can (not as worse as in Japan tough) The point just is that people who have worked the whole day or spend the whole day (and payed for their travel costs) in school have more right to the place the eldery people and people on welfare. Some extra information here! When I go out during the day when I'm having a day off I don't travel during rushhour just out of respect for the people going to work and coming to work.
