Guns are created with a specific purpose in mind, from self defense to hunting. 1. Assault weapons are created for the sole purpose of firing rounds as rapidly and accurately as possible in order to ensure maximum damage to the target. 2. Why should countries allow a device which is designed with the sole purpose of causing destruction into the hands of civilians where it can and has been misused? EDIT: By saying assault weapons I am referring to the guns and LCM's (Large capacity magazines) banned under the federal assault weapons ban as well as the guns created to exploit loopholes in that legislation.
