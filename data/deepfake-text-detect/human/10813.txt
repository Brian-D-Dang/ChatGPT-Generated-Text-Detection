Thermal Stress- Say your freezer is at (20 fahrenheit), the water in the container has now turned into ice and is at 20 fahrenheit as well. You decide to pour a glass of cool water (40 Fahrenheit) into a cup. You take out the ice and put a piece into the cup of water. The exterior of the ice cube will try to expand and melt in the water because it is warmer. Now the interior of the ice cube is still frozen at 20 and will stay put. This motion is relative and will induce stress [thermal stress] on the ice cube. Ice isn't a very strong solid and is brittle as well, the stress soon overwhelms the ice' strength and cracks. Hope this gives you a good visual of your question!," "when you put the ice in warm water, it will want to balance the temperature. It will quickly try to get through it's latent heat and change phase from solid to a liquid. It happens so quickly that it cracks. If you do it gradually it will not crack.
