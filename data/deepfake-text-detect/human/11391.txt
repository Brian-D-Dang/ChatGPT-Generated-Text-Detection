A 122,000-tonne ultra-large natural gas tanker is the first large ship to make an ocean passage of over 10,000 km under autonomous control. Prism Courage made the 33-day voyage from Texas to South Korea using an autonomous navigation system called HiNAS 2.0. HiNAS 2.0 steered the ship, calculated optimal routes and best speeds, and also located and avoided other ships. The system increased fuel efficiency by 7 and reduced greenhouse emissions by 5. HiNAS 2.0 will be on the market by next year, pending official certifications.
