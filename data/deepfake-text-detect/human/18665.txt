There is a big push against the consumption of GMOs (genetically modified organisms) especially in organic food. Some people advocate for any products containing GMOs to be labelled as such. I believe arguments against GMOs are largely unsupported. Many anti-GMO advocates call GMO foods 'un-pure', which completely ignores the fact that nearly all agricultural crops have been genetically manipulated (by artificial selection) for hundreds of years; though, artificial selection does use natural mutations and is much slower. Anyway, the bottom line is that I think the anti-GMO movement is largely an emotional reaction to something that may seem scary to those that don't fully understand it (or even to those that do understand it well). I think many people fail to realize the potential that GMOs have to increase food production and decrease malnutrition.
