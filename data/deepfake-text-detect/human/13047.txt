It's funny how the world works, really. One day you wake up to hear that mankind made it to the moon, one day you hear that the new president is black, and one day, you hear that humans only die on their birthdays. What a twist of events. I remember when I heard the news. All the idiots jumping off of buildings, driving recklessly, braving a train. I mean, not dying doesn't mean no pain, y'know what I'm saying? Eitherway, excuse me while I jump off this plane. The clock's almost 12am, and it's time to see if this time I die.
