My old phone died today. Many have encouraged me to replace it with a smartphone, an idea I've been very resistant to. My reasoning is this: I don't want to feed peoples' belief that I should be able to check my email, and look things up online, etc. at any given moment. I mistrust the mass surveillance enhancements that many smartphones come with. Data plans are expensive. I'm open to hearing thoughts on the subject, particularly from those who hesitated getting a smartphone and have found it to be of great benefit to their lives, now that they have one.
