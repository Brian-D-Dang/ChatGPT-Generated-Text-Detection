The night was exhilarating. Bright lights, countless handshakes, cameras and eyes that seemed to all be focused on me. Two years of late nights and stress enough to make my adrenal gland explode. My wife and I were being escorted to our limo when secret service pulled me aside, "A moment Mr. President?" I shared a glance with my wife and kissed her forehead. "Go home, I love you," I said. I knew based on the last two years that it would be longer than'a moment' that I would be called aside. I was escorted to a quiet side room, an inelegant place with plastic folded chairs and white walls. My head was lofty still on adrenaline. The chief of the FBI entered the room behind me, and to my surprise, the sitting president entered after. I assumed they would want to congratulate me in private, or share a celebratory nightcap. Our greetings were brief and formal. The sitting president leaned in close. "I have something important to tell you," he said. The solemnity he expressed in his eyes was grounding. In an instant, I sunk down from the rush of the evening. "Earth is an experiment," he said, "and you are the new director of the experiment. Congratulations." I saw in his eyes that this was a terrible fate.
