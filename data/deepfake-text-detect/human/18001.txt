I'm not to educated on the topic, but while debating with my friend I found three fairly credible reasons to legalise marijuana that would make it more difficult for people under the age of 18 (21 for some other nations) harder to become 'addicted'. 1) If marijuana was being sold and monitored to people over the age of 18, with some sort of ID presented, that would put the very vast majority of illegal production and distribution of marijuana out of business, so where would minors by there pot from? An older sibling or friend? They would have to buy it from the government registered weed store (or whatever it would be called) and if the government would make it so people can only buy a relatively low amount from the weed store, then this would meen minors would be able to get there hands on only a small amount of pot. 2) The money the government would get from selling all of this ganga would be able to go into drug education to minors, preventing many to ever starting the habit. 3) If the government can successfully knock out the weed selling business, then surely that would effect other illegal industries such as prostitution, selling other drugs and violence that are at least partly funded by selling pot. This would provide cleaner streets for the minors, and making it harder for them to fall into a life of crime. Like I said I'm not to educated in the matter and there are a few flaws, so CMV.
