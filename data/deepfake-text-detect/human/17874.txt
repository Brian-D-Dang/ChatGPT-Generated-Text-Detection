I hear very often the classic feminist argument: It is fine for men to have sex with a lot of women and not be chastised for it. Why must we demonize promiscuous women by calling them sluts? Double Standard! I don't agree with that. In my opinion, the feminist opinion is based on a wrong premise, which is that the analog of a promiscuous woman is a promiscuous man. But is this really true? Historically and evolutionarily, men have selected women for fertility, looks, and the ability to care for babies. Women have selected men based on material resourcefulness. Tall, rich men are in vogue since forever (a casual stroll through okcupid failed to find me a woman who dates a man below 6 foot tall!). But if that has historically and evolutionarily been the case, then we can better view the analog of a non-ideal woman being a non-ideal man (non-ideal in the eyes of society in general). The non-ideal woman is a bad-looking disloyal uncaring slut. BUT the non-ideal man is NOT a promiscuous man. He is a non-resourceful guy, a deadbeat dad, an unemployed basement dweller, a loser! And he is chastised by society much much more than a slut. If we view it this way, there is no double standard. Society just hates the non-ideal man AND the non-ideal woman. TL;DR In light of the above argument, I believe that the analog of a slut is an unemployed man and both of them are shunned by society. There is no double-standard. CMV. Hello, users of CMV!
