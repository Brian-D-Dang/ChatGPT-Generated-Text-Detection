Hello CMV! After a significant amount of discussion between the moderators we have decided to experiment with a possible addition to the rules and are implementing this new rule for a three week trial period. Any post that has littleno participation from the OP after 3 hours will be removed. Why 3 hours? This gives plenty of time for commenters to see the thread and start engaging with OP. Without a doubt there should be at least a few users in the thread. On the off chance that nobody responds to OP (really, really rare), we can be lenient (because obviously OP needs someone to respond to). For the super popular threads that get a disproportionate amount of attention, a 3 hour limit is enough to stop the thread in its tracks if OP is unresponsive. The thread will have just hit the front page. If we wait any longer, then new users who see it on the front page and comment will be wasting their time responding to an OP who isn't there. We will be trialing this rule for the next three weeks to see how it affects the subreddit and how you folks feel about it. If you've got any questions, concerns, or comments then feel free to post them below and we will do our best to respond to them. -CMV Mod Team PS - It should be noted that we will be doing this by hand, as we do not have automod set up to do this for us. With that in mind please be sure to cut us a little slack if the rule is not implemented with 100 accuracy. We will need your help reporting posts that break this rule. Note As this has been asked frequently, we will not be removing threads where OP doesn't have the chance to respond. If three hours has passed and there are very few replies to the OP's post then we're not going to remove it, they would not really have had a chance to reply.
