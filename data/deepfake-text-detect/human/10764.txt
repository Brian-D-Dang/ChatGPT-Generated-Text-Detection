A person who dies intestate, or without a will or beneficiary, will have their assets distributed "by law." There are laws everywhere to govern this sort of thing and vary by location. For example, the laws in England are different than those in the United States. In fact, in the US, the laws are by state. For the most part, the assets are placed into an account, an administrator is hired and assigned to locate the nearest living relatives. Failing that, the assets will eventually go to the State Treasury. Generally speaking.
