Liars!!!!!! Went in this evening to order iPhone 6, when told shipping dates was told that Space Gray 128GB would ship within 24 hours, and 64 GB would be two weeks, so I decide I wanted my new toy and paid a little more for the 128 GB. leave store all happy. 30 minutes later get email that will ship in 7 to 14 business days. I immediately call the store, phone rolls over to a voice mail box not set up- for 32 minutes. then if course store closes.
