Just like the title, says: I'm not going to whinge about music not being "what it used to be," but with ease of access to ever-improving technology, it seems that anyone can contribute their two cents - whether they be legitimately talented or not. For example, programs like GarageBand or anything else of that nature - along with YouTube and the other plethora of music services, have made making music too easy. In my opinion this seems to have resulted in a market where it is impossible for true, one-in-a-million type of musicians to really stand out and be recognised. Basically, I think that gone are the days when die-hard, passionate musicians who dedicate their lives to their craft can be exposed and recognised for their true potential, and I would like to see the other sides of this argument.
