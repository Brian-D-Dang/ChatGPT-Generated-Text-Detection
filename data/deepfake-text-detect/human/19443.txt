I am a "feminist" (broadly speaking). I believe in gender equality, though I prefer to call myself a social egalitarian. However, I do NOT believe that the lack of female CEOs is an indicator of gender inequality. This argument one of the main "calling cards" of feminists is bullshit. There are roughly 7000-9000 CEOs in America. CEOs make up an infinitesimal amount of the population. They are an extreme minority. They are so exceptional that breaking them up into "male v. female" or "black v. white," etc. is to engage in data manipulation. The "patriarchy" probably exists, but this argument doesn't hold water. Also, the CEO argument reflects, in my opinion, the lack of direction of the feminist movement. Yes, there are more male CEOS than female CEOs. But what does that mean for feminists? What exactly do the feminists want? Half of the CEOs to be women? Or is it "equal opportunity" for all women? Even if half of those 8000 CEOS were women, what next? How will the feminists use this enormous political influence? Lobby congress for feminist reforms? What would those reforms be? All of these questions illuminate this lack of direction. It's troubling that someone like me, a person who pretty much agrees with the feminist cause, has to ask these questions.
