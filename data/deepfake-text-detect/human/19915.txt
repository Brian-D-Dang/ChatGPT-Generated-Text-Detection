I used to believe that private organizations had no obligation to uphold things like freedom of speech. Every person should be entitled to run their business as they see fit. That's the stance I took during that whole Duck Dynasty thing. I thought they had every right to fire him. But someone I knew wrote an interesting piece that changed my view. So why shouldn't corporations provide basic human rights? Shouldn't everyone follow a certain set of principles set forth like the ones here? Change my view
