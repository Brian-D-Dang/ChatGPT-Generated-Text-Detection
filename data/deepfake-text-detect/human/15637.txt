On the disappointment scale, Italian Grotto ranks right up there with my never getting laid by my first girlfriend, whom I now know twenty years later is a lesbian. Three entrees and I sampled all of them. The marinara dipping sauce was heavy with tomato paste and not at all a good marinara. The clams swam in a broth so salty, it made my lips swell up like a pontoon boat. The fried calamari and artichoke were fried to a delicious, white coloration which, in the realm of fried foods, was about fourteen hues down from golden brown. This created confusion in my already befuddled mind. Was it cooked or wasn't it? I Had to take a bite to solve the mystery. Unnerving. I ordered an antipasto for two thinking I'd go light with meats, cheese, and relishes. Another huge disappointment. It looked like a salad with two buried slices of capicolla deep within and two, also buried, slices of salami. The remainder of the bowl was small bits of red and yellow peppers, about thirty pepperoncini, but mostly romaine tops. This was anything but a traditional antipasto, with the majority of the bowl comprised of lettuce. I don't know why IG hides the meat and cheese, but it pissed me off. I felt like the catcher in a game of hide the salami. Literally! I had to ask for bread since the antipasto was a bust. This made me feel like Oliver Twist begging for crumbs, and for no good reason at 12.95. The only thing good about this place was nothing. I suspect they've remained in business all these years primarily due to their location, and all the unknowing tourists. Never going back.
