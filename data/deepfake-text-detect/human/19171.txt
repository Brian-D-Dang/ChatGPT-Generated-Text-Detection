Inspired by the recent Askreddit, I decided to look through the casual encounters section on craigslist and it is getting to be tempting. I am 23 and still a virginI had oral with an ex-girlfriend of 2 12 years, but that's all she wanted. I am still recovering from the loss of that relationship (I broke up with her about 8 months ago) and am yet to really "bang it outwhich others have suggested would help me and I'm beginning to really agree with them. I've casually dated a tiny bit, but nothing really promising. I wouldn't consider myself ugly, but I am underweight, too poor for a car, am pretty shy, and the options here are very slim (almost every person in Utah County is LDS, and I won't be moving until I finish my Bachelor's degree in 2 years). I would most certainly use protection and I wouldn't go to anybody's house unless I had a good full picture of the girl. This would be a completely new thing for meI wouldn't have considered it like 3 months ago, so I am genuinely wanting a few good reasons why I shouldn't.
