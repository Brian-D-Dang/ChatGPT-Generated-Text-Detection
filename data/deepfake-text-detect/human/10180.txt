During the first week alone [32 million people] downloaded a copy of a Game of Thrones episode. Even if only 1 of those people keep the file they downloaded after they watch it it's still an amazing 320k - it's a pretty safe bet that possibly hundreds of years from now we'll still be able to watch that show. At no point in history has it ever been easier to ensure archival and preservation due to digital mediums, and yet by applying copyright protections the content makers are doing nothing more than ensuring their great works might be lost to the ages. It's not too hard to believe something like this might be lost - only 46 years ago millions of people watched the moon landing on TV, but almost no one had the technical means to have their own recording of it. Here we are now with the [original tapes missing] - sure we have a recording, but think of how much better recordings we might have if (like today) people could have made their own high-end home recordings at least matching the quality of the original broadcast. A very similar story can be said about the [missing Dr. Who epsiodes] - of which [some were recovered thanks to piracy] 500 years from now - I think the only copies of some uncommon films going to be some pirated copy taken out of a private archive, of which copyright protection had to be illegally circumvented to make.
