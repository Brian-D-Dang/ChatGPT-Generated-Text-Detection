In The Netherlands, where I am from, there's a distinction between so called 'softdrugs' (mainly Cannabis and a couple of other things), which are decriminalised, and 'harddrugs', which are illegal. Right now, in many places (including NL), the legality of substances seems to be completely ungrounded. Things that don't seem to cause much risk at all (I'm no expert, but XTC seems a good example) are illegal, while something much more dangerous (cigarettes and alcohol are the usual suspects) are available in every supermarket. I believe a factual analysis of the health risks of substances should be made when deciding on the legality, with addictiveness as most important factor.
