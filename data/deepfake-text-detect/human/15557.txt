My boyfriend and I went with another couple and went through all three haunted houses. The Circus Clown themed house was fun and the perfect amount of scary to ease you into it. The Vampyre Castle was really well done (I love Vampires) and was more intense than the Circus Clown house. Now for the main attraction: The Gates of Hell.... I was already announcing to the group that I don't want to go through this house, I'm good with the other two. Of course I was convinced into going and everything would be fine. I won't give away any of the haunts inside but I will say I had to say the safe word because I couldn't take it anymore. I've read all of these negative comments and it seems like I had the same experience as the others but I was expecting it. It is made extremely clear prior to you entering the house that you will be abused psychologically, physically, and not everyone can handle it. Even being the only one out of my group who caved and opted out I still think that this Trilogy is awesome! They do their jobs very well. Not everyone can handle the R rated house (me being one of them) but I expected everything that happened to happen. All in all, if you are up for the scare of your life then go!!! Yes they touch you but eventually they have to stop.... It's a great time!
