I called around to locate and get price quotes for specific tires with an out the door price including mounting and balancing. Purcell quoted less expensive than the rest. I agreed, made an appointment and they ordered the tires. When I got there they tried to sell me the scam tire insurance (It only adds replacement coverage for the 2 of punctures which are not repairable, and only at their chain) and I declined. The price which I was quoted was not the price I paid. They had two individual itemized charges for both balancing and for tire disposal and added a materials fee. It was about 70.00 over the out the door price, which became more expensive the last time I purchased identical tires elsewhere and competitor's phone quotes. They opened my hood and poked around while I was not present without my permission, then tried to convince me to have them do additional work which they described as dire. There is NO reason to open my hood during a tire transaction. It took almost two hours to change four tires despite an appointment and not being busy. This week I got a coupon in the mail, since they also added me to their mailing list without asking. I won't be using it. I'll give them some credit, though- they didn't take a chunk out of my rim like discount tire did with their rushed work. There is obviously a reason why business is slow for this shop when the scammable ASU students are away and why they have no reputation on Yelp. I gave two stars because the product itself is what I asked for and they were installed properly. They did do something right.
