A brony is a non-traditional fan of My Little Pony:Friendship is Magic. This means that they are fans of the newest MLP and mostly likely none of the others (though they could be) and they are girls 13 and up or boys of any age. Given this base information, I don't believe it's possible to make a case for why it's wrong for people to be a fan of this show. If it was called "how to kidnap and murder babies; tips tricks and techniques for a pro," I could understand, but for any normal TV show, I think it's a pretty tough stretch to say that just because you're a fan means there's any kind of problem with you.
