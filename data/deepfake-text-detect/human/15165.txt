Terrible service. They made me return to my house twice because I was missing documents. I did called prior to ask what I needed and they misguided me. I tried to talk to the manager and he was a complete asshole. I got a little discourage after going home twice without a car and still getting an attitude from the manager when I returned! The manager was so rude that I ended up going to Savmore instead, got great service there, rented a car for 3 weeks, so I guess it's their lost.... They not only lost that rental, they lost a costumer for life with me as I will NEVER deal with Advantage again nor EVER tell anyone to rent from them.
