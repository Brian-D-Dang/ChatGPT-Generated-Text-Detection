To my knowledge, Metalgate is about one website (Spin), just one, publishing a single article which contains a comment that people considered to be offensive enough to get upset over. The comment in its entirety: "Metal is still dogged by the issues that arise from its deep-seated conservative values, but thanks to an increase in conversations about racism, politics, and feminism, those on the right side of history have gained solid ground." I don't think this is anything to get riled up over. I mean, there are no hordes of articles proclaiming "metal fans are over." I feel like this is really not a big deal. Anybody want to change my view? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
