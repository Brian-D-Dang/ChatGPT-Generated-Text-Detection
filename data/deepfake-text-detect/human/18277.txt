OCD Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Their obsession is their relationship with god, following the rules and their acceptance into heaven. Their compulsion is going to churchtemplemosque and praying and following all the rules according to their scripture. I know OCD is often uncontrollable, an extreme anxiety disorder in which the obsession often changes but what if Religious people have a mild form of OCD. They feel guilty, fear, anxious and to get rid of their fear, guilt or anxiety they attend their religious institution, follow and read their scriptures, and uphold the name of god. Over 2 million people in the U.S. have some form of OCD and it is only growing and being diagnosed more. Even if they only have a mild form, I believe some of the behavior of being a highlystrict religious person is very consistent with the behavior of a person with ocd. Thoughts?
