There is no reasonable argument against using nuclear power to generate the majority of the energy needed to fulfil demand. The world would be better off if we had more nuclear power. I am aware of that there are drawbacks to nuclear power. This is not about nuclear power being the ideal technology. It is just that there is no viable alternative. We should make sure to utilize renewable energy as much as possible, but we will still need nuclear power. As always, there are exceptions, some countries should stay away from nuclear power (countries with unstable political climates, warzones, areas prone to natural disasters, etc.). This is why I limited the discussion to Europe. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
