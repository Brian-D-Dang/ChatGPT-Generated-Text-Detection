Why I hold this view: I've been homeless, living in hotels, cars, couch surfing for nearly a year and a half now. I'm a "healthy" non-veteran white male with no children and technically single, this disqualifies me from any special curcumstances. I qualify for a free healthcare plan without any trouble, as all poor have for years. My health is becoming increasingly worse due to my poor living conditions. Sure I can get check ups every month and treatments for what ailments may come up along, but i cannot live a healthy life. Yes, people need healthcare, but I could afford to cover that if the money put into supplying me with healthcare was instead put into a small apartment. What I can't afford is to continually charm my way through job interviews just to sacrifice the job a short time later because I can't sleep, can't shower, can't keep cloths clean and simply can't be reliable. Access to a stovetop, refrigerator, shower, safe place to sleep, somewhere to keep my things and have friends over should have an substantial positive effect on both physical and mental health. Cost to taxpayer wise, they work out about the same yearly. Personal cost, trips to the hospital throughout my lifetime have totaled about a year's apartment rental.
