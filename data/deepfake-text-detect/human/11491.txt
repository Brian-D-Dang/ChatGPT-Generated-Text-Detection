Instacart, an app that allows users to have groceries and other household items delivered, has changed it's tipping policy. The previous tipping policy included tip amounts in it's minimum payouts, which resulted in delivery drivers missing a large portion of their pay. Delivery drivers will now receive their tips on top of the expected payouts and Instacart has promised to implement the new policy retroactively so delivery drivers will be paid fairly for their previous work.
