Nothing: the media sensationalise what are, essentially, very boring stories. Partly this is because journalists aren't very good at science or statistical analysis, and partly this is because the media are in the business of selling, not informing. Also, a lot of these things are made up. There is no such thing as a "cure for cancer," because "cancer" is actually a broad term that describes a whole range of very different diseases, some of which can already be treated and even cured. So a scientist, for example, takes a bunch of mice with a tumour and injects them with a Substance X, then three weeks later notices that in about 20 of them the tumour appears to be slightly smaller. A paper is duly published and the popular press find it. So all the other scientists read it and start picking holes in it. Was the experiment carried out properly? What else could account for the findings? Has anyone else been able to conduct the same experiment and get the same results? What did the scientist forget to account for? All this, remember, even before anyone has started asking whether this treatment would even work in humans. Journalists, though, read it and write up a story headed: "MIRACLE CURE FOR CANCER! SUBSTANCE X REDUCES CANCER BY 20!" which, of course, is wrong on just about every level imaginable. Some of the worst tabloids will run stories about miracle cures and health scares that directly contradict what they said a week previously. One week, salt gives you heart disease; the next week it lowers blood pressure. This is because they either simply don't know how to interpret results of studies, or deliberately hype up these stories to sell more papers.
