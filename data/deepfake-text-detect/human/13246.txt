I'm a twenty year old man. My job as a computer securities technician keeps me in the black. I'm an active jogger so I don't have to worry about gaining too much weight at a stay at home computer job. I can't move out of my parents house. I live in the body of a five year old child. My first suicide attempt was thwarted last year when I tried to slit my wrists. Now I'm under constant watch. I'm trapped, so desperately trying to remove myself from the life I was born into. If I had been born four hours earlier, I would not be in this hell. Unlike 99 of leap year children, my brain developed at the proper human rate. My body and mind are mismatched. I long for my first kiss. The soft caress of a loving hand. When my body is finally eighteen and legal, my mind will be that of a 72 year old. Gauging from family history I will be developing alzheimers. Will I even have an interest by then? When my memory is being eaten away and all I have left are my early years, what would be worth remembering? I can feel a soft warmth in my head. After one long year, it will finally end. Every pain pill, muscle relaxer, and cold medicine I've been given is now sitting in my stomach. My limbs are tingling and heavy. Freedom from life at last.
