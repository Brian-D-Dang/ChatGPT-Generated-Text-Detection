The extremist Muslims in that link (and those involved in other acts in the UK which would earn an American Muslim a hole in the fucking chest), like extremist members of other religions, believe that people who don't follow their magic book will go to hell for not following their magic book. They have to enforce the one true religion or other people are going to go to hell. They won't learn until some smart person either locks them away where they can only bother other criminals or puts a fucking hole in their chest. EDIT: I would speak this way to a 5-year-old. I don't want kids picking up religion. That shit's dangerous.
