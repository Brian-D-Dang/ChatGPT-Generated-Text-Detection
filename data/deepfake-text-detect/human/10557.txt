Basically, we're gonna hit a wall with what we can achieve alone. Humans someday will reach a pinnacle of technology - tech becomes increasingly more and more complex as time goes on, so it is logical to infer that eventually we won't be able to make anything new alone. Look at anything modern, like smartphones. There are teams of people who build pieces of it - they are fantastically complex machines made out of complex machines. As we continue to advance things are likely to get more and more complicated, so if and when we do hit a point where we can't invent anything new, sufficiently advanced machines might be able to do it for us. Just one reason. A'real' AI would truly be awesome, the possibilities for such a construct are endless.," "There are certain problems and functions that are better tackled or solved by AI techniques than conventional programming techniques. The problems tend to be highly parallel and the AI trains on large datasets to find a solution. AI programming for now is problem specific. It's not anywhere near human brain versatility. IMO we are a long way of. Source: Datacenter, HPCAI industry data
