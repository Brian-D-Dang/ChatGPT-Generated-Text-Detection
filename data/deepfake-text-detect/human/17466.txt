Moral values appear to be inherent traits in people and don't really need religion to exist in my eyes. As someone growing up in a nonreligious household, I feel that I was raised with good morals and have become a good person who can control his base urges and "sins" without needing a religious institution's guidance and help. Numerous philosophers have written about their views and scientists have studied animals or searched for a moral gene and published results that seem to support the idea that morals are inherent. Even googling morals cannot exist without religion seems to turn up many pages that agree, but large numbers of people argue that some god and his teachings are the only thing keeping people from being immoral beasts. I recognize religion is a necessity for many people and has been a part of society probably since we discoverer fire. I just can't agree that without it, we'd be immoral.
