Il Mulino Staple of NYC and My Hometown comesto Las Vegas in the new section of the forum shops on the North End of the Strip. Everything is pretty much exactly like the originals with complimentary Cheese, Salami, spicy fried Zu chini, brushetta, various breas etc your suffed and you didn't start yet. 8 of us tonight so 3 bottles of wine are more than suffcient. Tons of specials available but the boys whent for Standard fare. Langostino speials were excellent - Meatball appetizer excellent - Linquini Carbonara SINFUL, Linguini Bolognese Killer, Entrees various but standouts were Veal Fiorentino, Linquini Frutte de Mare, Osso Bucco with Rissoto Compliementary Lemoncello liquore served. Service well simply stated AS GOOD AS IT GETS... Pricey Yea probably but all and all a fine dining experience from a name we have come to trust.
