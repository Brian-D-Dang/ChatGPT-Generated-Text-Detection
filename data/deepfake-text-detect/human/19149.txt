Edit: I don't hate the fellow. I have issues with the heavily biased way he is portrayed today, a depiction which I feel is so far away from the truth, that it would have bother Gandhi himself. Gandhi in textbooks, gandhi in prayers, everywhere a photo hung about him and how saintly he was. He and Nehru, aah yes..anyone knows what Nehru ever did for pre-independent india? What about Savarkar, Tilak, RMRoy, Godbole, Karve, Bose, and the entire platoon of 1857 freedom struggle torch bearers? Why do school textbooks seem to ignore them, why does no school child even recognize their photos? Books showing flaws in Gandhis character are banned frim the country. Seriously CMV. My kids are going to see Gandhi worshipped in a temple while other freedom fighters will decay into historical nothingness.
