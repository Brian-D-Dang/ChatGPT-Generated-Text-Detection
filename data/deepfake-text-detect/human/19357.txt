Whenever a radfem does something abrasive and potentially unjust in the name of feminism, you'll always have those who will say that "they aren't real feminists" or "not all feminists are like that." While they're quick to tell this to the average person, how often do you see them out in public decrying the actions of radical feminists? I like to think of it as "guilt by association." You have a feminist and a radical feminist. The radfem is shouting the usual "cishet white male oppresion" spiel and how they should tear down the patriarchy by any means necessary. The regular feminist doesn't agree with the radfems reasoning, but since they are supposedly fighting for the same goal, she ignores it, and wonders why some people treat her with disdain before she even says a word simply because she identifies as feminist. She's being viewed as being supportive of the radfems since she isn't speaking out against them with nearly the same fervor that the radfems harbor. A lot of the focus on feminism is attracted to the radfems, like the ones who harassed those guys at the cathedral in Argentina. He who speaks loudest is heard, and since the radfems (there are varying levels of radical by the way, not just the shrieking pseudo-terrorists) are constantly out-voicing intelligent feminists, it's beginning to leave a stain on what started out as a great movement. If regular feminists would hold rallies and protests against radfems just like they would about other issues, then feminism wouldn't be demonized as much. CMV.
