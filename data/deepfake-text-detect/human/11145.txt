That's a funny way of putting it. I feel like you've acquired a mistaken notion that somehow visual stimulus is the "right" way to become turned on. People get turned on for all kinds of reasons: blind people, for instance, can get turned on just fine! It's thinking about something arousing that does it, regardless of how you come to be thinking about that thing. It obviously varies for a lot of people (I know guys who basically never look at porn and only read erotica) but in general men have been scientifically shown to be more strongly affected by visual media than women, who are more likely to read erotica or simply fantasize.', "Imagination can be much more vivid then just images or video. I have read erotic things online and they work just as well as anything else. The other key to novels is that they don't have the outright shame of normal porn. You can buy a novel that just so happens to have sex in it, its not like you are just watching hardcore porn or anything you are reading a book. Kind of like buying a playboy for the articles.,I understand that asking "What's the difference between reading and seeing it?" is a stupid question.
