Yes and no. Are they going to have to share the total market share? Yes. But two competitors located near one another may draw a lot more total traffic than if they isolated themselves from one another. Take the classic American shopping mall for example. About 20-50 of the stores are casualwear shops, but they do just fine. Why? Well, someone might not take a 45 minute drive to go to just the Gap, but if they can go to the Gap, American Eagle, Aeropostale, Hollister, and a dozen more, then that makes the trip much more worth it. So while those stores do compete, their proximity to one another brings more value than they lose (hopefully).', "You're probably looking at something like hotels, fast food restaurants or car dealers right?
