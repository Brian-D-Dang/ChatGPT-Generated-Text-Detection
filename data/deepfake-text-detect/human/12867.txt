A bitter cold wind nipped at his back as he slowly peered down. His feet were perched just at the edge of the bridge; another inch forward and he'd be catapulting towards the icy water below him. He could see jagged rocks jutting sharply from the water's surface. He briefly wondered what might be lurking beneath. Breathing slowly, he lifted his arms to his sides and closed his eyes. "I'm ready." He said, and then he tilted forward and allowed gravity to greedily wrap its arms around him. The cold wind cut into his skin as he rushed towards the water. "I am going to die," he thought. Oddly, he was filled with a sense of relief. There was nothing to control, nothing to fix, nothing to help. In this moment, he was completely free. The crashing waters below got closer. He thought about his mom, wondering if she would be okay by the end. There had been no time to explain, no time to prepare her for this. He needed this. As the jowls of death stared him in the face, he was finally alive. This was acceptance. A smile lifted as he shut his eyes, enjoying the rushing wind and the sound of water growing louder. Then, his entire body thrashed upwards, his eyes snapping open in wonder. His stomach lurched as he rocketed back up towards the bridge, briefly pausing mid-air to gently drop back down again. He looked up, past the thick cord blocking the view near his feet and saw his mom peering down at him, laughing in relief. He watched the rocks below grow smaller and smaller as he was slowly lifted back to the bridge. Clambering to his feet, he stood, shakily, and ruffled his windblown hair. "Can I do that again?"
