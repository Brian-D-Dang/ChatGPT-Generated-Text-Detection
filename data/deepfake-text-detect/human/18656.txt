I feel as though nothing is important in life; let me explain: First of all, I'd like to start by saying that my background in beliefs limits itself to agnosticism, but I tend to be more of an atheist person. This being said, I find it hard to live life knowing that we are the result of a pure coincidence, and that mankind has no given objective or goal. So basically, humans are'nt any more important than a chicken, a bear, or a hornet. In the greatness and infinite universe, we are meaningless specks of dust. Because of this, I find it hard to find importance in anything. I am rarely happy and rarely sad. I just live. I enjoy the outdoors, video games, sports, drinking, ladies, and basically every normal activity, but I can't wrap my head around feeling important or feeling that somethign is important. When I hear that people die on the news, I find it just as terrible as a dog or sheep dieing. I also cannot fathom people who post regularly on social networks, and tend to dispise them and think that they are crazy narcissistics who have no idea of the unimportance of life. Is this normal? Please try to CMV because this is driving me crazy.
