Seven years, seven years and I have seen the bankruptcy of many artists around me. However, none of this matters to me now as survival has become my only thought for a while now. I am constantly starving. I have to work almost all of the day. I am alone. I sit on my own inside my little basement hoping to famous, yet lurking in the shadows. Yet I remain happy, knowing that people enjoy my work and I have not bent over the king rat. This was my life, and I remained thinking everything was fine, until one day I heard a knock at the door. I still remember how hard the knuckles smashed against it. It was formal, but the person clearly had a patience that was thinning by the second. I asked "Hello, who is it?" even knew who roughly who he was. It was somebody who was a worker for Disney, a thought police officer. He snappily replied "I work for Disney and I think you may be in possession of illegal creativity. My heart skipped a beat, which was then followed by a shot of adrenaline as I leaped into action. "Can you give me a minute?" I barked, hoping that would buy me enough time to hide the artwork in my room. He shouted back "One minute and that is all I expect of you, then I am knocking this door down." I rushed around my minuscule apartment, shoving anything resembling a spark of an original thought under my bed. The seconds were counting down, but I managed to hide all my portfolio under the bed. Or so I thought, as I opened the door with surprising confidence. "I can see your computer, and I do believe you are coming with me." blurted the worker. I could have tried to defend myself, but I knew if I could speak to the king, that I might a bigger chance of solving the creativity crisis.
