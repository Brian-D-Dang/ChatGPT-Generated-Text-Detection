Please don't think of this as having any genocidal or racist undertones. We have all this literature (Gattaca for one of the best examples) for why selective reproduction is bad, evil even. Sure we complain about it in the short term, but in 50 years would this mean a healthier world with less death from illness, less suffering. (less famine due to the drop in the birth rate). It is understandable that from a human rights perspective this might be a rather horrid thing to say, denying one the right to reproduce or have the joy of children. All people being born equal and whatnot. The mantra "everyone deserves a chance" comes to mind. But maybe we just try and sort this stuff out first, then we have a happier world in 50 years where everyone can be equal and not have disadvantages because of the bad luck of being born by a genetically disadvantaged family. Sure it sounds offensive when you think of individual cases, but in the long term and from a utilitarian perspective, this would mean in 50 years these individual cases are starting to sound a lot less bad than they are now.
