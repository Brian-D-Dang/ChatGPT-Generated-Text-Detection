NASA will be conducting extensive workplace safety reviews at SpaceX and Boeing due to Elon Musk smoking marijuana on Joe Rogan's podcast. NASA's administrator Jim Bridenstine says "If I see something that's inappropriate, the key concern to me is what is the culture that led to that inappropriateness and is NASA involved in that." The reviews are expected to take months and require hundreds of interviews. It's not clear whether or not they will delay flights, as SpaceX is currently scheduled to do an unmanned test launch in January 2019 and a manned mission in June 2019.
