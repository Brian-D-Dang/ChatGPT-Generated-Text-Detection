To be more specific, birth control and abortion should be illegalized and people should be forced to have children until the negative utility of a life consisting of being forced to have children reaches equilibrium with the positive utility of having another life experience the world. One important factor of my argument is that any new human life that comes into existence at this point in time has a net positive experience. I say this due to the fact that most people don't commit suicide. Additionally, I have the basic belief that we should try to maximize total happiness in the universe. Thus, because on average people's lives are positive, we must be obligated to bring as many people into existence as we can. Therefore I would like to see methods of preventing birth like birth control and abortion illegalized, along with a legal requirement to reproduce. Now, this cannot continue forever. Eventually having so many new people taking up resources and forcing those that are alive to reproduce will create negative effects that take away from happiness. But when do we stop? The obvious answer is to stop when the negative effects of my proposal are about to overtake, or reach equilibrium with, the positive effects. I do not think we have reached this point yet so I currently support forcing people to have children. I feel like this is a bizarre stance so CMV. Hello, users of CMV!
