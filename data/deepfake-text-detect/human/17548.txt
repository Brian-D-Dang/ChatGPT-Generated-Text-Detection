Decriminalizing drugs has proven to reduce drug use. We spend billions of dollars locking up non-violent "offenders," it would be much cheaper to offer medical treatment to those in need of it. If introduced to drugs in a normative environment as opposed to sensational gatherings - raves, parties, etc. - kids, teens, adults would be more prone to responsible drug use. It would generate billions in tax revenue. Disassociating drug use with its various social stigmas would help to prevent abuse; by not reinforcing negative stereotypes, people would have less motivation to act self-destructively. It would take money out of the pockets of violent drug lords, our war on drugs is the only reason they've become billionaires, and put it in service to the public. It would free police officers, federal agents, etc. to focus on violentunsavory criminals. Legalization would promote demilitarization of domestic police force. No governing body has the right to dictate which substances a consenting adult consciously ingests. Many drugs (cannabis, psylocybin, ibogaine for example) have legitimate medical value. Would lessen spread of misinformation, aid scientific researchadvance. It would create tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of jobs. Prohibition is immoral in every way.
