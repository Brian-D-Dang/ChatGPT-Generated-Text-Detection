Well i think you got my point but i will talk about it more. Almost everybody have smart phones these days. People can take photos, add filter to them and upload them. I know it's their choice to take whatever photo they like and whatever filter they want to add to but when they do it their followers say "omg you have 'the eye', you're the best." I don't understand this. There are people out there who uses professional dSLRs with amazing lenses but they're not appreciated enough. I love taking photos but every time i see, read this kind of situation, i just hate it. Can you change my view on this ? (btw sorry for my english:)
