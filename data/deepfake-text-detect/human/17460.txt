In my experience, universities require you to take many courses completely unrelated to your chosen field whereas college is more focused on relevant classes that make you viable in the workforce. The program I am currently in is comprised of a carefully selected set of courses. My college receives regular feedback from companies that employ graduates of my program. If many of them say that their new hires are missing a particular skill set the college will change the program to include its instruction. It also removes courses if enough gradutes say they have not been useful. The program is in a constant state of change to meet the demands of the industry. This is how education should be done. Contrast this with university, where half of my first year courses were completely unrelated to my field and the time it took to graduate would have been twice what it is at college. I have many friends who are forced to go to university because local colleges don't offer courses related to their interest and have to pay for and spend time on these useless classes. Why would a potential employer care that my engineer friend took a World Religion class? Universities should make such courses optional. I believe the current model is simply a money grab and serves no other purpose. And yet there is still this idea that a university degree trumps a college diploma, so I must be missing something. CMV
