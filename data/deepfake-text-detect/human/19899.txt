[This is not an April Fools prank. I genuinely dislike OS X!] I used Mac OS X for many years as a video editor. When my Mac broke, I went back to Windows for 2 years, and now I use Linux. I find both Windows and Linux (Ubuntu Gnome) much easier to use than OS X. My roommate has a Macbook Air, and his screen is always a total mess. It is a pain to work in full screen, and there is no snap to corner feature. Copying and cutting files is not straightforward and the dock is a cluttered mess. I never know if a program is open because there is no clear indication. I know people who leaves several programs open for months! In my view, the OS X bells and whistles encourages sloppy behavior and reduces productivity, especially if you need to alternate between multiple programs. So this is it: change my view! Edit: Okay, consider my view changed! I still think OS X stock settings are awfull, but now I see that everything I dislike can be easily circumvented. So that's it, folks!
