My husband was in the hospital for blood clots in both of his legs and lungs. The Dr was extremely rude. My husband had told them he was in pain the Dr said that is not my problem, that is you problem. Im here just to make sure you follow-up with your primary. When we asked questions she said Google it and ask your primary at your follow-up appointment.
