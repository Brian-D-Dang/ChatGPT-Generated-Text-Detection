My argument is by legalizing drugs, it will be dominated by big corporations. Right now because of the illegality of drugs, big companies cannot enter the market which restricts it to small entities (like individual dealers, or perhaps a gang or cartel). They also operate in a drastically limited scope because of the persecutions of the law. I believe if you were to legalize it, pharmaceutical drug companies and the like would see the massive profit to be made and enter the market. They don't have any particular obligation to not make their drugs very enticing (addictive, etc). You may argue that regulations will keep immoral decisions (like trying to target teenagers) at bay, but that would be a rather dangerous bet considering the common held view that companies hold large sway over laws and regulations. I think that really opens the floodgates to modified drugs becoming really prevalent. Nothing appeals to a company more than a consumer that cannot stop buying and consuming their product.
