(Edit: My view has been change though there is still some interesting stuff in here) First I want to state that my opinion doesn't lead me to hate or judge transgender people, I simply want to understand their thought processes. In my opinion there is no reason to change genders. I believe that the genders are equal in every way (except biological and physical differences of course) so why change genders. For someone to say that they feel that they are a certain genders, associates feelings with genders. That leads to interests and emotions being tied to genders, and slowly leads society to have gender roles be popular again. many people I know have disagreed with me however none has changed my mind before I hope someone here can.
