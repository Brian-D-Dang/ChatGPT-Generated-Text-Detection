His name and face flickered up on the screen only after it had started buzzing. I looked over from my computer screen and dully, mild shock registered in my brain. Everything had been dull lately. In my mind, he wasn't dead; he was just calling to tell me some new breakthrough he'd had with whatever he was writing. I picked up my phone and held it for a moment, looking at his smugly smiling face from my screen. I should answer it. But who could be calling me from his number? Why? Why would they do that to me? I answered it. His boyfriend's face popped up. We stared at each other for a minute. He had been crying. I had not been. Finally, he swallowed and said, "You..... had texted him last. I plugged in his phone. It said come home, stay safe. You wanted him to come over to yours." I sighed. "He was out really late. I was closest." I looked away from the screen, I didn't want to cry, I never wanted to cry. "I'll always be his older sister, you know? I'll always want to keep him safe." "I know." I looked back at him, and when our eyes caught, his face began to crumple again, a small sob releasing itself from his chest like a ghost. The noises he made wore down the very last of my resolve. "I miss him." And then we were both crying, ugly tears that they don't show in the movies clutching our phones, mine and his, hoping that the answer laid somewhere in the circuitry.
