Not sure how to ELI5 it because no one can understand electricity, but old toasters used bimetallic strips, whereas a lot of new toasters use capacitors. Basically when you turn the dial you change the distance between the two capacitor plates, changing the capacitance and thus the voltage it can store. It stops toasting once it can't store any more voltage. Feel free to correct me since I still kind of think electricity is magic. This video and its comments might help as well: URL0,In older toasters, when you push down on the lever to start toasting you actually bring two pieces of metal in contact, completing a circuit. This circuit also activates an electromagnet which keeps the toaster in the "on" position. One of these pieces of metal starts to bend under enough heat and eventually cuts off the circuit, deactivating the magnet and popping out your toast. This is why you can't keep a toaster down when it is unplugged; there's no power to the electromagnet to lock it.
