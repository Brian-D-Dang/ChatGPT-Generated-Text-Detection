Based on the hurricane struking Puerto Rico in 2017, we developed a transportable disaster response system "DroneGo" featuring a drone fleet capable of delivering medical package and videoing roads. Covering with genetic algorithm and a biased random walk model mimicing a drunk man to explore feasible routes on a field with altitude and road information. A proposal mechanism guaranteeing stochasticity and an objective function biasing randomness are combined. The results shown high performance though time-consuming.
