It's a relatively simple idea - much like driving, voting should require an obtainable license. You go through a several months-long course, which teaches you about basic macroeconomics, citizen rights and obligations, how to spot a politician lying through his teeth, how the government works, taxation and some other mandatory stuff, after which you take a test (multiple times if needed) and only then are you allowed to vote. Now ultimately the courses could not teach the subjects in-depth, but it should be enough to educate voters on what they can realistically expect and demand from the government and their representative. The ultimate goal is to have a better educated voting base - a democracy is only as good as the citizen participating in it. Also - this should be by choice and not thought in school. Why? Because the school system cannot guarantee that the student is going to pay attention or remember everything in class. You might say that this a failing of the educational system, but I'd rather take into consideration the imperfect world we live in. That and things given freely and without effort are often unappreciated, having people work for their right to vote would make it much more dear to them. Some preemptive QA: What if the person doesn't have enough time for the course Then said person probably doesn't have enough time to properly research the candidates and political parties as well, making his vote - uneducated. Wouldn't that cut many people off Yes, that's the point. You remove people who tend to vote based or no information or with false expectations. What if someone fails the test Then they can take it again. How would such a system be implemented. Dunno. What stops someone from getting the license and then going "fuck it" Because the license would, ideally, need to be renewed every ten years or so.
