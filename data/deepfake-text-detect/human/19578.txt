Muddling through college beginning my Sophomore year, been bouncing back between Environmental Studies and International Studies. At this point, the investment seems frivolous. I look at my friends who have graduated college with these types of degrees and they work an okay job like I do now without a degree. I'm not gunning to be a doctor, a teacher, a lawyer, or any set profession from an academic pursuit. I believe that having a bachelor's degree, in just about anything, will not give me an advantage because I don't have a career in mind requiring a degree. EDIT: Thank you to all who have responded and future respondents. I have to leave for classwork right about now, but I promise to thoughtfully reply once I am home again tonight. I'm at a crossroads in these types of decisions right now, and I appreciate every bit of feedback.
