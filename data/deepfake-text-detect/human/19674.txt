This probably also extends beyond the United States. Learning history is obviously important. We need to understand the influences that have shaped the world into its current form. Being able to think that way is important. Memorizing the years of Millard Filmore's presidency is not. Easily-accessible data that we can google should not be the focus of history classes. They should focus on making students thoughtful and involved in society. We should teach students about important issues (Cuban Missile Crisis, Watergate, women's suffrage, etc), but not countless details to memorize. I realize I focused on the subject of United States history, but these arguments apply anywhere. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
