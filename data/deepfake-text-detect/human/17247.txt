Natural selection will naturally select the characteristics that are fit enough for their environment to live on and all the unfit characteristics will die off eventually. This happens over millions of years, of course. The way I see it, we are assisting these unfit characteristics survive by protecting these species that are dying off because of one reason or another. It seems to me like we are impeding evolution by trying to control another aspect of nature. I feel like the only really good reason we have for protecting these creatures is that we think they're adorable or can't imagine a world without them. Some people say that a creature dying out would have serious repercussions on its environment and of course it would but the other living creatures would have to adapt like they always have and always will.
