When I was a child, I was just fine playing with legos, barbies, and play doh. I don't condone the use of ipads and cell phones to entertain children. I see it all the time. In grocery stores and the mall, kids start acting up and the parents just shove an ipad in the child's face. There, problem solves. I'm not saying this is bad parenting. It's just lazy parenting. The parents could stand to take a break from shopping and pay little more attention to the kids to figure out what's wrong instead of just taking the easy way out. True, there are apps on there that are especially suited for children and help them learn, but children will get addicted to these things. I mean we, as grown adults, are inseparable from out technology. We shouldn't be forcing this addiction on children. They're too young to be so dependent on technology. On another note, there has been research done that concludes that Ipads affect a child's development negatively. They're less aware of their surroundings compared to when they're playing with normal toys. Other research suggests that using an ipad too often could lead to underdeveloped muscles because this kids are staying stationary for a long time, only making use of their fingers. They suggest that children shouldn't use an ipad for more than 15 minutes at a time! I know I've seen kids use them much longer than this!
