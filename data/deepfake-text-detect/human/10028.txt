I believe we should all be held accountable for our actions, both verbal and non-verbal. I believe folks say hurtful and mean things online that they wouldn't say we're they face to face with their victim. In the rules of this very sub it requests us to be respectful of one another. Shouldn't that go without saying via the golden rule? Why is the Internet the exception? For the record, what I mean by "basic info" is enough info that our mother could identify us (first name, last initial, city, stateprovince, country, age group, sex). I do NOT mean enough info that we be could be found by extremist bigots who disagree. As an alternative, why shouldn't sites offer two comment sections: Open and Anonymous. This way if you want to be an asshole, you still can, but the would-be victim and rest of us can take comfort that you wouldn't have the brass to say it without mask.
