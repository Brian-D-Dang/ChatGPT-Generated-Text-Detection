All eyes upon me. All eyes. I used to be like them, handsome and just. But now their beady eyes scan me with contempt as I pass by them in the street. Their faces twisted into a look of contempt, disgust, and never pity. In their eyes, I did this to myself. We break our appearance through our actions, and I've been shattered. They leer at me, they jeer at me. A disfigured man am I, and so I deserve their hatred. I did bad deeds. I broke myself for them. They know this, how could they not know? Judged by a beautiful jury, filled to the brim with their own righteousness. A thousand pretty faces made ugly by their scowls. For they wouldn't do it. So I had to end her suffering myself.
