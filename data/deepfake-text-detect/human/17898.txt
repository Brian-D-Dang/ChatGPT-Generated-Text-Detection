Like many of you reading this, I'm concerned about our educational system, whether you are from the US or not. There is always room for improvement. That said, I think homeschooling should be illegal (or severely restricted, i.e. tight requirements for testing, certification for the parents, standard curricula that mimics those taught in public schools) for a few reasons: 1.) From personal experience, homeschooling severely retards the growth of the homeschooled in terms of social and intellectual development. 2.) Homeschoolers do not have access to the same education as students in public school. They cannot share the same level of facilities, expertise in teaching, nor access to different opinions (the basis of higher education) when they are homeschooled. 3.) in an age of interconnectedness, interpersonal skills are paramount. Knowledge of how to deal with people is essential in every job. Being at home interacting with a few people every day does not allow the student to learn these skills. 4.) Motivation: Homeschoolers do the work because Mom or Dad tell them to. People who go to school do not. When they get to college, and Mommy or Daddy is no longer there, which one has a higher likelihood of success? In short, homeschooling should no longer be an option as it denies the child the basic right to an education that prepares the pupil for society. Instead, it is a breeding ground for narrow-mindedness, and limited social development. CMV reddit
