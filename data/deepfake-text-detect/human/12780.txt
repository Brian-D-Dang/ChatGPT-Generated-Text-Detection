How many dead people have you seen in your lifetime? One, Two, maybe more if you are some kind of emergency responder or in a natural disaster. Does it ever get easier for those people? Watching the thousands of electrical signals signifying life eventually die out like a candle on a windowsill. I have only ever seen one such dead body, and it was not in a casket. It was in the driver's seat of our car. He was drunk, what would you expect. He tried to stop us but it was too late. I will never forget the last thing he tried to do in his drunken state. He put his arm in front of me. He still wanted to protect me. Looks like he failed at that too. I can hear sirens now but they won't arrive quick enough. As the tears fall from both of our faces and alcohol drips from his mouth, I look at the ground and see that in the end, it all turns to blood.
