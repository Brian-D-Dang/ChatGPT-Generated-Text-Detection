So apparently I have to put some stuff here. I know this submission sounds very narcissistic and full of cynicism, but at this point I'm about ready to give up on relationships for awhile. Every relationship i've been in has ended in heartbreak, and it really makes me wonder what the hell is the point? The happiness is great while is lasts, but ultimately is culminates in sadness. I'm 25, I've been in a few longterm relationships. I just don't understand why it always ends poorly. Maybe this isn't the best sub to post this in. I'm just really losing faith in relationships and finding 'The One'.
