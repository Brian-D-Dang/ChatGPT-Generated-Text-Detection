I just discovered [G K Chesterton] and like it's not unheard of, I'm amazed at the guy's relevance to today's debates. I think everyone in Reddit should read him, for many reasons. First reason, the guy writes [deliciously] . If he had written nothing but nonsense it'd be a pitty too little people know about him. Second reason, he finds a very special place for the Christian comandment of loving your enemy: debate. Chesterton was incredibly respectful towards the other side, many times openly admiring his opponent's intelligence or intentions. This love for the enemy was so present in his philosophy, that he seldom let emotion cloud his judgement. Though he is many times stubborn or arrogant (I think? may be brit humor), it's seldom about the central disputes in the argument. This leads to a compassionate criticism of modernity that's easy to read by progressists, and may make conservatives question their own fury. Most of his apology of religion isn't something that would convert anyone; but it's about deconstructing silly assumptions people have on religion with common sense. He never disproved atheism, but I believe he demoralizes youthful anti-theism. The last and more important: his unsual arguing style is really mind opening. Even if you don't buy a single one of his arguments, it's really impressive how anarchic and yet logic his thinking is. And because modern thoughtReddit is so: - passionatebigotted against other beliefs - uninterested in knowing the other sides arguments and motivation - naively anti-theist - obsessed with rigid discussion patterns that go nowhere We all should read more Ches, and it would make the intellectual world a much better place.
