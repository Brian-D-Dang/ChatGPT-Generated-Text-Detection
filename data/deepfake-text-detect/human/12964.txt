Dad, The day I realized you didn't care anymore, I realized, neither did I. Mom found a man who loves her, and us, children he raised as though they were his own. I found a wonderful woman, one who I've given everything for. And looking at her, I know that I'm not your son. I know this, because I know I could never treat her the way you treated the woman you vowed to hold dearest until your dying breath. I was naive in thinking you'd come to the wedding. From what I heard, you opened the letter, glanced over it, and tossed it in the trash. A fitting gesture when looked at from the perspective of your only son who you did the same to. You're an old man now; bitter and alone. I take solace in the fact that you'll die alone. At least this way, you'll never treat another human being the way you treated us. Goodbye.
