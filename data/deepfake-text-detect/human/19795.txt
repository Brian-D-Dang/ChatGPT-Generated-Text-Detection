My reasoning for this is pretty simple. The main prerogative of a human's life [Edit: a living being's life] is to avoid death, at all costs. Therefore I can assume that anyone wishing for death needs mental help, and is certainly not in their right mind. I do feel that people in extreme, unsolvable physical pain should be allowed to die, however. There is a threshold which they would need to reach, and hopefully an age limit. This way, 100 year olds writhing in pain on the hospital bed may be euthanized, but only with theirtheir family's permission. Children born with a condition, however, should not be allowed. This is because I feel that there is hope that their illness will be cured in their lifetime, or very soon. This law does not apply to indirect suicide, such as refusing cancer treatment or not getting various inoculations. Please, CMV
