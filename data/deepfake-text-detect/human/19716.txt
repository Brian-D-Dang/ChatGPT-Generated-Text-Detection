And by companies, I don't mean websites and such, I mean the advertising services. As far as I know, Adblock doesn't block non-obtrusive ads and particularly doesn't have the capability of blocking actual product recommendations that are hand-coded (for instance, I can have a series of textimage blurbs that I write up for my site which use NO banner ad service and won't be blocked by Adblock). The banner ad industry is careless, abusive, and annoying and doesn't deserve my time, attention, or money. I don't feel in the slightest guilty for blocking them and recommending that others do the same. EDIT: When I said that adblock doesn't block unobtrusive ads, I meant they don't block ad services and methods that aren't known scum. Just because an ad service uses some ok ads and some shit ads doesn't mean that we should have to sift through them. There's nothing wrong with adblock blocking a service like that wholesale.
