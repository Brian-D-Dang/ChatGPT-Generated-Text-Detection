Arthur Cory, 49, said the flag had been kept in a cupboard at Penllyn Castle near Cowbridge, since he was a boy. The flag, one of only three surviving from the battle, is expected to fetch up to PS50,000 at auction. It is said to have flown above Nelson's warship HMS Leviathan. The flag's "most probable" route to Penllyn Castle was through Mr Cory's ancestor Nicholas Cory, a rear admiral on William IV's Royal George yacht, the auction house said. Roland Elworthy, senior valuer at Holt's Auctioneers, said he had "no doubt as to the flag's provenance."
