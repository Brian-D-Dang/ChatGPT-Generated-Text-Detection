August Henry's is a regular lunch stop for me downtown. Yes, it's still lent so I once again tried a fish sandwich. I promise I enjoy all types if food. I wanted to share that it can be tough squeezing in lunch here under the traditional 1 hour lunch window. Also anticipate the bill to be closer to 15 per person and easily could be 20 if you do some add on's. I went with jumbo fish sandwich and a cup of soup. The soup was a cup of clam chowder and it was delish! I could have just eaten a few bowl of that. The fish was breaded and perfectly cooked with a side of chips. I got my ever present coke w cherries added. I recommend this stop if you are lucky enough to work downtown.
