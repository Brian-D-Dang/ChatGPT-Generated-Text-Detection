There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man showing nothing but boxers with little girls walking nearby?), but it is not and will not be addressed because of the fear of being called racist. My view: Saggy pants is not a cultural quirk, nor akin wearing your hat backward. it is offensive in a very real way, and should not be tolerated (in the sense that indecency laws were created for the same underlying reason) Edit: so through a few comments in this thread, I've altered my view on this.... 1. it has been correctly noted that many ethnic groups sag their pants 2. Offensive really is subjective, and I've realized the solution is a society I really don't want to live in (shira law for example) 3. there really are examples of dress that could be more offensive from that perspective
