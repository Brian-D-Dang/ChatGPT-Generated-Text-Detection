As the human race has developed we have been fighting each other for a large portion of the time and as many have observed the development of new technologies has been accelerated in war time. I believe that it is now our prerogative to use whatever means necessary to advance our civilization. This would only be a means to an end to develop the technology to stop using fossil fuels once for all so that this slowly choking planet can once again breath.
