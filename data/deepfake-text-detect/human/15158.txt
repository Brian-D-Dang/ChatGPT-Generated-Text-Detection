This is the place to be in Charlotte. I am a nighttime gym-goer, and I needed a gym with late night hours. The Dowd is open until 10 during the week, which while I would prefer 11, works for me. Also, going at non-peak hours saves me from the parking and crowding issues that others seem to face- ain't no crowds at 9:30 pm! I generally stay in the Women's Fitness Center, which is a gym inside itself, but every now and then I'll make it upstairs. The desk staff is always friendly, and there are plenty of amenities to utilize. The one area I haven't ventured into yet are the group exercise, mainly for scheduling reasons, but I am eager to sneak into one one day.
