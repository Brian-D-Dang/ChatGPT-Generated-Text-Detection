To me, this is the exact same issue, just a different year. In 1967, the US passed a law which made it legal for two people of different races to marry; and just recently, in the year 2015, the US made it legal for two people of the same sex to marry. Some of the arguments i have seen in opposition of gay marriage are: "homosexuality is a sin" "not natural" "erodes the sanctity of marriage" "slippery slope leading to marriage of " "not healthy for children" "goes against God" These all seem to be the same arguments that were presented in the 1950's and 1960's when people were fighting for marriage equality between the races. So why haven't people learned anything about equality over the last 60 years? edit 1: The best argument iv seen thus far was by umoonflower when they said "Racial difference is not the same as sex difference, even if some of the the arguments against them sound similar." This isnt an end all statement; but a great point. What is the difference? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
