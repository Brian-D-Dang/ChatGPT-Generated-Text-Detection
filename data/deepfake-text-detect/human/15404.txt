Fantastic steakhouse. It has everything Flemings has with the same quality but within a five minute drive of my doorstep and at least 15-20 less expensive. We usually eat here on holidays (Christmas Eve, Easter and birthdays) when visitors come to town and the occasional happy hour which puts us there 12-15 times a year.
