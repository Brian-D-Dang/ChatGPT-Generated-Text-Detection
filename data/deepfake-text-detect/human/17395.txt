Last night, I was looking at various movie reviews on Reddit, and a lot of people seem to dislike the use of CGI in movies, and they say that it distracts them. I believe that certain scenessequences can't possibly be filmed without the use of CGI, and can't see why it's such a bad thing - For example, I think that the CGI based Hulk from the MCU is much more 'Comicbook'y and and was quite enjoyable, compared to the old Hulk TV series that featured Lou Ferrigno in body paint (It definitely was an entertaining show, but I feel that having something similar in the MCU would probably be weird to the viewer than what they have currently).So, Reddit, CMV.
