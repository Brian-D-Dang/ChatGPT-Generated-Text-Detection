A technically advanced indoor vertical farm is growing a range of crops inside the basement of a former sugar factor in Liverpool. Farm Urban was founded in 2014, growing salads and leafy greens all year round in vertically stacked foam-filled beds without natural sunlight and soil. Traditional methods of agriculture are no longer sustainable, and a complete overhaul of food production methods is required. Other alternative farming ventures have failed in the past. These alternative food production schemes face real financial challenges. Costs must be closely monitored in order to manage the business. Farm Urban has a plan to make sure their business is viable. Its strategy is to start small and increase production as demand increases.
