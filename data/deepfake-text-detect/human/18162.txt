I have a healthy six-figure sum of money in various investments and enough passive income that I actually don't need to work anymore. I like my work, but it is tiring and I'm getting old (I'm in my 30s). Should I just quit my job and stay at home and play WoW? Here's why I think this: I do find my work somewhat intellectually stimulating, but at the same time I don't feel like I'm doing much for society as a whole and, well, the time and energy of having obligations to fulfill is a bit of a drag. It'd be much easier to check out, and I can, so why not? I do not currently play WoW or any other MMORPGI did play it for a few months in 2007, though.
