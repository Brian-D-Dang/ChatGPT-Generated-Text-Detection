In my view, people in each culture inevitably and necessarily employ the ideas, symbols, and inventions of other cultures without understanding the larger context or history of these features of the other cultures. I don't see a fundamental difference in majority cultures appropriating minority cultures and the reverse situation. Further, I don't see how use of such cultures out of context is harmful to the original culture. What is "marginalization," really? Please help me understand why so many people at my university are so passionate about this issue.
