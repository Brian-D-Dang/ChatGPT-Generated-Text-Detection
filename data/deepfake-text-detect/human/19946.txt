Hi everyone, After watching the news recently, it really does seem that the cracks in the EU since the recession are starting to get larger because of foreign policy matters with Russia. Hearing that some member states (UK mainly) are really watching the elections sort of had me thinking if Europe could ever be a unified body. Dissolving of the EU would probably be terrible for the region because of increasingly nationalistic parties making a comeback into the political scene. That nationalism, I believe, will create animosity between countries, which, in a worst case scenario, lead to another war. I really hope I am not being too doom and gloom with this post, but I would really like to hear more about this subject. Please pardon my ignorance if this comes off as so, but I would really like to learn a bit more about what might happen and maybe CMV. Thanks!
