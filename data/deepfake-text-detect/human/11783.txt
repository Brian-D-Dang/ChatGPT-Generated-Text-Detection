GitHub Sponsors is a way to fund your Open Source project, but most developers aren't getting the most out of it. Getting people to sponsor you can be difficult. A way to increase your number of sponsors is to create exclusive content for them, for example, articles, videos, and other educational material. You can restrict who has access to your posts, depending on their sponsor tier. GitHub Sponsors is completely free to use.
