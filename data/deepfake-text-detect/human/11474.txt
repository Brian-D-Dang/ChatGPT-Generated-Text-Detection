Apple has released the iOS 13.1 beta, weeks before its September 10th event where it is expected to announce the iPhone 11 to the world. The early beta release may be due to Apple relieving pressure on their iOS 13 promises by spreading out the development process over the entirety of iOS 13, as well as allowing the company more time to fix bugs in the system. A changelog is available that lists features such as AirPods Audio Sharing, which appeared in previous versions of the iOS 13 beta. This may mean that the feature may be released with iOS 13.1, rather than iOS 13.
