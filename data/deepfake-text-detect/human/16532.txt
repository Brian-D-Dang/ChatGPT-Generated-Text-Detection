We developed a Statistical Automatic Post-Editing (SAPE) system that works on Machine Translation (MT) output. A hybrid word alignment model was employed into the SAPE system. The proposed hybrid approach combines different word alignment tables and provides the well estimated alignment links to the SAPE system. This also allows the proposed system to correct lexical errors, erroneous words using insertion and deletion, as well as word ordering. We carried out the experiments on parallel dataset consisting of English text, Spanish MT output and corresponding post-edited output. In this paper, we have also applied the Hierarchical Phrase Based SMT (HPBSMT) to the SAPE system. It has to be mentioned that the output of our SAPE system not only provides better translations than the standard MT output, but also reduces the post-editing efforts as per the evaluation done with respect to different MT evaluation metrics (BLEU, TER and METEOR).
