Specialization means they are better at acquiring that kind of food than an omnivore would be. For example, carnivores can have huge razor-sharp teeth. They couldn't have teeth as sharp or large if they also spent time eating plants since they would get in the way and biting the plants would dull the teeth making them worse for tearing flesh. The omnivores win out when food is fairly scarce and thus being able to eat whatever is more important than being good at eating a particular thing. When food is plentiful, carnivores that specialize in hunting are going to outcompete ones that can eat the occasional bunch of veggies.
