I mean seriously the government legalized out right spying when I was 8; its just been a part of the world I live in ive known about it for years; I don't really think privacy is that big an issue, you can still get it with some knowledge. The Iraq war is murder, the drug war is imprisoning innocents, the irs is theft; spying is just creepiness nothing more. cmv
