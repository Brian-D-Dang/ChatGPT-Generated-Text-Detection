This review is from march and was posted on the wrong Picazzos. Such a disappointment. I've enjoyed picazzos in Sedona and tempe and even the cactus location and the food and service quality has always been fantastic. Today we went in at 1230 with 5 people. The restaurant was more than half empty but I only saw 2 servers. They were extremely understaffed for what these servers could handle. It took 7 minutes to be greeted and took 20 (YES TWENTY) minutes just to get our drinks (all fountain drinks or waters.....) it took 15 minutes for an appetizer and our food arrived much later than that. When our food did arrive one person didn't even receive theirs. So disappointed. The waitress blamed it on the new cook. No apologies. She never came to check on how the food was. And now, 3 hours later all 5 of us are suffering from some form of food illness. I have been in the restaurant for years and if I preformed how the staff did today I would be fired on spot. Such a waste of a beautiful location and gorgeous restaurant. Shame.
