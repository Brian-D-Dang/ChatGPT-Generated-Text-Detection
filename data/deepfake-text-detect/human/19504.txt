Bloodline marriage is looked at as unacceptable and wrong to many people, and the majority of the people I know. The only reason I see this to be is because it is what they were taught, just like how some are taught gay marriage to be wrong. I don't care if people are gay, and I don't care if people like their cousin. However, plenty of people who accept and support gays are disgusted by these bloodline relations, when I see it as the same thing- people love each other and it doesn't matter who it is as it has no effect on anyone, but the lovers. Besides the risks of having inbred offspring, I don't see anything wrong. So tell me if I'm missing a detail and CMV. EDIT: heading to bed, will look at replies in morning
