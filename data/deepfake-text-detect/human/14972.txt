Old outdated rooms, my shower had luke warm water and I was told by hotel staff there was nothing they could do about it.... and suggested I try running my sinks, flushing my toilet over and over and again to get hot water.... Totally inept check in out staff or system. I waited in 4 person line for 45 minutes to get a final billing statement. Never coming back here again.
