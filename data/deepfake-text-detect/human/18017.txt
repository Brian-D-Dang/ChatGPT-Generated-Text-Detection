In a majority of the posts on the front page at the moment, the OP hasn't awarded any deltas, and in some of them they haven't even responded to any arguments. This seems to go against the point of the subreddit - people should be willing to listen to counter arguments, not just ignore them and keep their views. In some threads there may not be convincing enough arguments to make the OP change their view, but I think that if everyone was posting in good faith and with an open mind there wouldn't be such a large proportion of posts where the OP gave no deltas. I'm not exactly sure what we should do about it - perhaps we could have a system where the number of deltas you have given is counted, or we could tag posts where the OP doesn't respond. Any thoughts?
