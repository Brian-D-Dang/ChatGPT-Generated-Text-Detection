Pyongyang gets electricity semi-regularly during the day. Living in Pyongyang is reserved for the elites - ie, the leadership of the army and the worker's party of Korea. It's the only part of the country that isn't effected by food shortages, often to the expense of the rest of the country. It has a university, functioning hospitals and a working metro system. There is limited cell phone coverage. It's basically North Korea trying its hardest to present it as a normal city while the rest of the country starves and crumbles.
