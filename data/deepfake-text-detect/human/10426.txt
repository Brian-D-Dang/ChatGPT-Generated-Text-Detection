There's been so much uproar over Sweden and the Netherlands and other countries that have been dealing with immigration issues. I would like to move to another country in the future so I understand wanting to move to a country in Europe, although I am not seeking asylum from a war torn homeland. At any rate, these countries have a history of an ethnic population and when one thinks of Sweden, there's a certain image just as when one thinks of what and who constitutes any specific country. I would hate to have Sweden be overrun by rampant immigration from any country (my problem is not with the Muslim population specificallyMiddle eastern immigration but the idea of rampant immigration in general) just as I would hate for any other country, let's say Bangladesh, to be overrun with let's say, British immigration.
