Two stars for outrageous price, 3 stars for quality of food. If you have had real and inexpensive Chinese food, it will be very hard for you to justify a meal here. We came here only because 1) it was open late; 2) we needed soup for sick fiance. Didn't order any dim sum because at 6 for 4 hor gao, it seemed like highway robbery. I had the Mabo tofutasted just like the packaged kind I buy for 2. This was 15, plus 3 for steamed rice. Fiance got noodle soupnothing we haven't had before that was not only cheaper but better. Maybe if you are into PF Changs kind of Chinese food you should try this place. 50 for two people is cray cray. That would feed 4 people easily at a real Chinese restaurant! I realize this is Vegas and everything is expensive but for some reason, I have a harder time justifying paying this much for Chinese food because it is usually so cheap.
