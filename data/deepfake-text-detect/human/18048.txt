Well.....I guess I've said enough in my post. India, shockingly, the land of which wrote the Kamasutra, and the land respectful of transgenders historically, has now gone all ape-shit and is about to dictate what I should do in my bedroom... So, what next, ban blowjobs? Ban everything but the missionary position? Ban condoms too, because apparently, sex is only for procreation, and any recreational sex is criminal, then who needs condoms? So, as a direction to my CMV, I request to be convinced as to why gay sex is such a big issue...I know that american western redditors don't have much of an issue, but I ask specifically the Indian andor ultra-religious redditors...anyone can join though, not an issue...the focus being on the point that the things I mentioned as exactly as unnatural as gay-sex, and so should be banned too...
