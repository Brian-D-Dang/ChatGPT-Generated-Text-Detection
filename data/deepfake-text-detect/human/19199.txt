Let me just start by saying this is mostly to help me get out of a recent break up. My ex-girlfriend just left me for my ex-bro 2 weeks ago, and it's killing me trying to get over her because of my view on love. My view on love is this; everyone has 1 heart, everyone has 1 love. Since I was a wee lad (about 10, I'm 18 now) I decided that too many times people cheat and too many times people throw the word "love" out like it's nothing. If you look at a high school, even college too, people are going from one girl one week to a different one the next, and with all the girlsguys they are with they talk about how much they are in "love." I decided that there can only be one love, so I waited 17 years for my first girlfriend. After a year my so called bro called her beautiful once, the next day she was gone. It's too hard for me to get over her because we were in love. I said it, and I meant it. Because of my view on love I just can't imagine moving on.
