Yes, it does. What happens depends on the regenerative power of the type of tissue that the tumor is removed from. With the exception of the liver, our organs do not regenerate so if your remove any part of them that's it, it's gone. Usually when there's surgery involving tumors, they remove the tumor and take a little bit of the surrounding healthy tissue as well so they're ensuring they get all of the cancer. As a result, you're left with a gap in your body that either is permanent and the surgeon closes off (such as if it's an amputation) or that part fills with fluid (as is the case with a removed volume of cerebral material). Things may change further over time as your body reacts to scarring in the area or a large volume of material is removed from your internal tissues and there's no longer rigid structure there to support them. It's kind of like how the hole from an extracted wisdom tooth eventually fills in. [edit: adding one other option - a transplant or graft. They can introduce replacement living material like a tissue graft or transplanted organ to replace the area you lost, or they can introduce something like a'scaffold' graft of sterilized bone tissue that your body can incorporate into itself.
