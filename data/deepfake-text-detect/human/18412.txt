I grew up with the 151, and they're obviously great. But restricting yourself to just that set seems like purism for purism's sake, when in reality, of the [568] Pokemon that go almost completely unexplored by those who descry the later generations, it's impossible not to find something you like. This is true for two reasons: in the general sense, it's ridiculous to not think that in over 500 new creations, you won't find something cool. The law of large numbers just can't abide that, y'all. Second, there was a greater effort in the later games to find interesting type combinations that still look like animals or plausible creatures - a tired but valid criticism of later games is how weird and un-animalistic the later Pokemon get (What of Porygon? Mr. Mime? Jynx? That fucking tree with three eggheads on it?) - which I think yield a few universally awesome results: [Delphox, a FirePsychic fox pokemon, basically a better Ninetales] [Empoleon, an emperor penguin Water starter that gets the Steel type double for its wings and crown] And even the more innovative spirit-type pokemon get interesting type pairings: [Froslass, IceGhost Noh-inspired spirit] [Golurk, a Golem-inspired GroundGhost type] My view is that there are people who willfully ignore some of these later Pokemon out of purism, or maybe even laziness - but that checking them out would reveal some real gems.
