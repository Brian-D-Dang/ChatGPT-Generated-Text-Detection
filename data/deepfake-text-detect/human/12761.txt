For fuck's sake! What the hell happened to this thing?! What the fuck did I even make? I followed every instruction to the dot and I got this?! Everything looked before I went to sleep. I made the globe and made everything habitable and observed it until those cute little lizard looking things appeared. It should have stabilized at that level for a long long time. But look what I got. Such rotten looking globe! How? I looked away from my scope and sighed. Upon closer examination, I finally pinpointed what's killing my ball. It's these things. What are even these things? They're all over. It's like a plague. They're infesting my ball! How did they grow so much in such a short time? These things keep sending signals to me too. It's odd..they seem to be aware of my existence, but that's impossible! Yet all these crazy requests that don't make sense keep flooding my display board linked to this orb and they're all directed to me. This is bizzarre. I can't even do anything for them. They're just too freaking small. Those little lizards I made were already way too small as it is but these guys are still just dots on my scope at maximum magnification. I shouldn't even be touching the orb and risk contamination. Agh, what am I thinking? Now's not the time to be reading these weird requests! I should be figuring out how to reverse whatever's happening to my globe! But is that even possible? Should I just destroy the whole thing? Goddamit, this project is like forty percent of the class. How am I going to explain this to my teacher? It's over. I'm going to fail biology.
