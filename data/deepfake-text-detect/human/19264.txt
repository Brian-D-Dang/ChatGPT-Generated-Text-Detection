[edit]Thank you guys for your comments, I appreciate your answers! My view was slightly changed. I will still be ready to cover when inviting, but will communicate more when being invited. I am talking about movies, dates, shows etc. I invite someone out to a movie? I don't ask them if they have money? I will pay. I think it's unfair to get a person and launch them into the situation of 'spend money or don't spend time with me'. I think that if you ask someone to join you, you start with the assumption that they have no equipment that deals with the particular situation (that is in your control, of course). If I ask someone out I will pay, and vice versa (I would expect). What are your views, and should my view be changed?
