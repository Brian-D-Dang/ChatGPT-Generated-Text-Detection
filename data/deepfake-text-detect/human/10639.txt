I know of a way, that I have seen used in Brazil, but I don't know if this how indeed is done. So lets say A bad guy want to get a message to E the news agency. So A gives to B, B TO C, C to D, d to E, the reason is hard to track back, is that most of the chain is random, could be kids that are given 20 and "hey kid, give this to a man on the bar," man in the bar does it the same way, and so on... And not always the same people are used, so going to a kid and saying who has given you this? Is useless because the kid doesn't know. Another way, anonymous mail deliveries.
