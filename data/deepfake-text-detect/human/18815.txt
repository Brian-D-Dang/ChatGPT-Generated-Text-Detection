There's been a few things in the news recently, like HMV going into administration and Universal taking over about 50 of the music business that make me think my dream of being signed to a record label, releasing albums etc. may soon become impossible? I don't really know enough about what's going on but I've heard the music business is headed for disaster, and that it will become harder for small bands to get noticed.
