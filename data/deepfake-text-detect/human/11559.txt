From June 1, any photos uploaded to Google Photos will count towards the user's storage limit unless the photos come from a Pixel phone. Google One plans are available for additional storage space. Any photos uploaded before June 1 won't count towards the storage cap. 80 percent of users aren't expected to hit their storage caps for another three years. Google has created a tool that finds blurry snapshots, screenshots, and other items to make it easier to delete unwanted photos.
