[This] is an overview of what I'm talking about. Basically, the theory states that men and women have different mating strategies owing from the fact that women produce very few eggs and men produce tons of sperm. The optimal strategy for men to spread their genes as much as possible would be to mate with as many women as possible, and the optimal strategy for women to spread their genes successfully would be to mate with high quality men who are sure to help invest as much resources in the offspring as possible. In theory, this is supposed to explain: -Why men on average prefer short term flings and women prefer long term relationships. -Why women find wealth and status attractive and men don't -Why men are more commitment-averse -The virgin-whore dichotomy (men don't value the same things in a short term partner that they do in a long term partner) -Prostitution -Jealousy And a whole bunch of other stuff apparently. It makes sense on its face, but as we all know, academic science is highly volatile, and most studies aren't very good quality, especially in evo psych and sexual psychology. I'm not ready to be convinced just yet. Change my view?? Edit: If you have access to good quality studies refuting or confirming these points, be sure to post them as sources!
