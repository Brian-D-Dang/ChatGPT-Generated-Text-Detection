The fundamental theorem of arithmetic continues to hold in unique factorization domains. An example of such a domain is the Gaussian integers Z[i], that is, the set of complex numbers of the form a bi where I denotes the imaginary unit and a and b are arbitrary integers. Its prime elements are known as Gaussian primes. Not every prime (in Z) is a Gaussian prime: in the bigger ring Z[i], 2 factors into the product of the two Gaussian primes (1 i) and (1 - i). Rational primes (i.e. prime elements in Z) of the form 4k 3 are Gaussian primes, whereas rational primes of the form 4k 1 are not.
