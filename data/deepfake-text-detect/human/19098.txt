I think that Lycurgus was the greatest Greek reformer, though I have limited knowledge, considering just how many there were. I think that while he did leave his kingdom to go die, this was a lot more noble in his time and did not prevent his people from moving forward. I also think, that when compared to Solon, he was much better. His practices are still maintained today (in some form), and though Solon's are too, his people did not always like him. 50 were pissed off at him at all times, he could not please the rich and the poor, nor could he instill proper order like Lycurgus did. We debated this in my Greek Classics class and the opposite views were really pointless, though I know it's stupid to call one 'the best'. CMV!
