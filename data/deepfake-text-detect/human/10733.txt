The choice between "a" and "an" is based on how the word sounds, not how it's spelled. If it starts with a vowel sound, then we use "an." We pronounce "United" like "Yunited," so it's "a United States ship," but it's "an unsinkable ship., "You used'an' if the sound following is a vowel sound. United stated is pronounced sort of like yunited states. The'yu' in this case is not a vowel sound, so'a' gets used. Similarly, it is an MBA student, because the M is pronounced as'em' making it a vowel sound, thus needing the an.,Thanks, I asked my teacher this (Grade 8) and she said, "I dunno." So, thanks.','It's not the vowel, it's the consonent sound. United is pronounced "yoo" so we use A. Just like we say "An" honor despite honor not starting with a vowel. The vowel trick is an easy way to teach the grammatical difference between a and an when you're young, but it is not accurate all of the time.
