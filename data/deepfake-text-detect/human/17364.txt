Currently, the United States is kind of in shambles. The economy is really not doing well, the taxes are high, and poverty, unemployment, and homelessness are in the rise. I feel that the voting system needs to somehow be redone. I recently saw a video about voting, and how broken US voting can be, in particular the electoral vote. I think that the states should possess more local power, and that the federal government should be much less powerful. After all, the country is the United STATES. I also feel that the United States needs some different ways of regulating big businesses. If I am a president, and I want to limit big business. I will try to impose limits, which are actually achievable by the huge corporations, but not smaller ones. As a result, small business dies, and large ones flourish, and monopolize. Businesses like Wal-Mart are destroying local businesses across the United States, and there isn't enough action being taken to prevent it. I think the United States could benefit from returning to a somewhat isolationist foreign affairs policy, like it had in the time of the founding fathers. Patrolling the world and solving their problems is a waste of tax payer money, manpower, and time. The US should decrease military spending, and let the world deal with their own problems.
