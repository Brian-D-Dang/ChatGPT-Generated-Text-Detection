And I am talking only about showers like those at gyms or pools. Not the usual american bathroom style showers which double up as baths. There isn't much to say i defense but to quote George Costanza "its all pipes." The only argument I can think of is the urine might be passing over or under my feet. But its hugely diluted plus it isn't really so harmful to begin with. Also, possibly in some settings there might be different drains for toilets and showers where they might be repurposing the water after processing it. But I am not sure how prevalent that is. So, as I see it, it is a harmless practise and if anything it saves time and a bit of water which would have otherwise been wasted in flushing down the toilet (4 gallos is standard I believe). Please, change my view.
