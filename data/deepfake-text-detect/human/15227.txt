There is nice seating outside on the sidewalk, like many restaurants along Mont Royal. We had breakfast outdoors here one morning during our most recent stay in the Plateau area and both the food and service were excellent. Order taken promptly, waitress attentive, etc. My eggs over easy were cooked perfectly and my order of bacon was ample (4 slices). And fresh squeezed orange juice to boot. All for around 10. Great value and a nice little place for breakfast.
