In this paper a class of discrete optimization problems with uncertain costs is discussed. The uncertainty is modeled by introducing a scenario set containing a finite number of cost scenarios. A probability distribution over the set of scenarios is available. In order to choose a solution the weighted OWA criterion (WOWA) is applied. This criterion allows decision makers to take into account both probabilities for scenarios and the degree of pessimism optimism. In this paper the complexity of the considered class of discrete optimization problems is described and some exact and approximation algorithms for solving it are proposed. Applications to a selection and the assignment problems, together with results of computational tests are shown.
