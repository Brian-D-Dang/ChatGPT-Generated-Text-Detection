The number of live births to 15-19 year old girls in the US in 2012 was [305,388] . This is simply too damned high. The chances that a kid will have a normal life when birthed to a teenager is statistically [very small] , as are the chances that a teenage pregnancy is within wedlock. Statistics of when people choose to have a kid show a definite upward trend. In addition, we already require male physicals that involve digital penetration of their sphincter. With those facts in-hand, I can't see a good reason why we shouldn't require that males in the US undergo a [RISUG] at the age of 13 as a part of their physical exam, giving them an injection of polymers into their vas deferens that causes them to become reversibly infertile for 10 years. At the age of 18 (or earlier, with parental consent), they can easily have this reversed with another shot, or let it continue to provide contraception until they're 23 and out of college. This has so many benefits to society with so few negatives that I can't think of a good reason why not to do it once RISUGs go on the market. But that's where you come in. Hello, users of CMV!
