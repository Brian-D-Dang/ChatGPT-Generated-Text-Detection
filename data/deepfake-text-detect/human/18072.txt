TCMV: [Earthlings.] Some of you may have heard of it before, but it is an incredibly powerful film. Basically, I didn't understand the extent to which cruelty was going on within the industry until I saw this, and it's definitely changed the way I view meat. Please tell me your thoughts on this. I think it's only natural for a human to be affected by this video. Edit: The video doesn't just explore cruelty, it opened my eyes to other things like deforestation etc. as well.
