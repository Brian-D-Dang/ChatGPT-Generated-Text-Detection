Came here this past weekend to pick up some donuts before heading back to the OC. Got there about an hour before they closed so we knew we would be limited to selection. The place was quiet and clean. We picked up a dozen of their donut holes, an apple fritter, and an apple filled tostada looking pastry. it was pretty cheap too!! The donut holes tasted fresh. The apple fritter was huge but full of sugar to me. The apple filled tostada was the best..it was not too sweet and had good amount of apples in it. A great place to get a deal if you like donuts.
