Quick background: I'm a male feminist. I believe that women should be treated equally in all areas of life, whether that be in the workplace, in politics, in the home, etc. The objectification of women is a very serious moral issue that does nothing but hold women at a different standard than men. It stratifies women and places value in the superficial that is completely irrelevant. The Miss America pageant was held last night, and I feel that having a contest to determine the most beautiful girl on stage, who has the best runway walk, the best bikini body, etc., is demeaning. I know that the contestants also have to interview well and have some distinguishable talent and in this way they are supposedly role models, but in the end, the image of the winner is more significant than anything she did or said. Obviously the contest exists because it generates revenue for [whatever network it was on], but I don't understand why these pageants are accepted and even celebrated. EDIT: I have to get ready for class, so I must be off for now. I'll log back on ASAP. Sorry! Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
