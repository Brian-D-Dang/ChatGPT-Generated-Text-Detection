Water is constantly naturally recycled - indeed, the process that does so is called the water cycle. Water only leaves the cycle (and then only temporarily), when it is locked in ice or when it is deep underground. The issue with water conservation is not that the world will run out of water, it is that the water isn't necessarily where the people are or that the water that is accessible there is not clean. Climate change is changing the patterns of weather; it is raining more in some places, less in others. The difficulty comes in places like California, which have lots of people and are now getting less rain. Overall, due to the melting glaciers, we probably have more water in the global water system than before. One note: in general, we can trade energy for water, so should we solve our energy problems, we can also provide water, through desalination (removing salt from sea water)
