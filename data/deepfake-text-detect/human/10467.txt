There are several kinds of microphones. The most basic is called a "dynamic" microphone. It works by having a large coil of wire move around a magnet, which induces a current that we can record and playback as sound. The problem with dynamic mics is that they aren't very sensitive, so they don't pick up quiet sounds very well. The solution is to use a condenser mic. It's called a condenser because in British English the word "condenser" is the same as the American word "capacitor." A capacitor is an electrical component where there are two plates separated by some material and then charged. A condenser or capacitor microphone works by charging one of the plates (which means a condenser mic has to be powered, dynamics do not need a power source), and then one of the plates is free to move with sound, which changes the capacitence, which we can use as a signal. The thing is you can make those plates very, very small and out of very light materials, which makes them much more sensitive. The pro of a condenser is it allows us to record softer sounds a lot better, which makes them great as studio mics. The con is it picks up everything we don't want a lot better than a dynamic. You tend to use dynamics in places with loud sounds where you don't want room noise or any bleed, like in a live concert or in a noisey environment that you can't control.
