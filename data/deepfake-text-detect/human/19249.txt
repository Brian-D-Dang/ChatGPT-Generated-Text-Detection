I despise the darn "the man" ideal-ology. It's too wide ranging of a label and too varied of situations to use such broad strokes when painting that picture. But, I feel ish is pretty messed up. The current "system" seems to perpetuate a continued loss of voice for the individual in favor of the lobbies and PACs. The lobbies, regardless of political affiliation, are voiced by dollars. Because money is what it takes to win elections (average Senate seat costs 10.5 million to win). If I were politician I would like to keep my job, as long I don't feel it's morally or ethically wrong, I assume I would do what I need do to remain employed. Politicians, I assume, vote a particular way not always because they want to, but because they have to. They want to keep their job too. (I'm trying not to point the finger at politicians. I don't think most politicians are corrupt, per se. I think the way things work currently can force their hand in a direction they might not favor. I'm sure [read: hope] most politicians get in the game to try to do good - I just don't think it normally turns out that way because the of the system we have created.) Politicians vote in favor of the bill because come election time they are going to need the financial backing from those PACs for their re-election campaign. I feel this issue, if not addressed soon, will be America's Achilles Heel.
