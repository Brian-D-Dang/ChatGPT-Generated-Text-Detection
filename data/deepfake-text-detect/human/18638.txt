Based on some ideas from [here:] There has been recent clamor from many (especially on the internet) over the DC Circuit decisions regarding Net Neutrality. Many Internet users, including myself initially, felt that the Court shouldn't make such petty distinctions between a "telecommunications carrier" and "information service providers" and as such eliminate ISP's from net neutrality. But, rather than innovate the Internet, keep ISP's from monopolizing service, and ultimately "save the internet," reclassifying ISP's to fall under Net Neutrality rules will hurt the industry more than help it, because it is now government forced. This is because the new legislation will cause ISP's to be harassed with legal turmoil out the ass, making it even more difficult for potential new ISP's to start up. It will place legal limits on existing and future ISP's, again harming business. Government can force an industry to act a certain way, but it will ultimately lead to a less beneficial business for all parties involved (except government). Not convinced? Consider Comcast. Net Neutrality is no longer around. Let's assume that they start nickel-and-diming Netflix for using their bandwidth every time a customer streams (which is a big concern nowadays). Netflix gets upset and ultimately has to charge their customers more. They tell their customers this, and the customers protest in various ways. Everyone hates Comcast now, and Comcast either loses business (through its dislike with its customer base), or stops nickel-and-diming Netflix. We all hate when big business monopolizes. Net neutrality encourages monopolization through legal limits, and while it may seem that government regulation will preserve our internet, its important to remember that the internet has never been neutral, but nor has it been monopolized.
