Hello. I have awesome friends of all age, in different social groups. They are funny, smart, witty, comfortable with themselves and self confident. And that makes me angry, jealous and depressed. One time I talked with some guy, my friend came and stole all his attention. They smiled, talked, I stood there and felt like a fifth wheel. It's not the first time when one of them do something that makes me feel inadequate and stupid. I know they are just being themselves and not trying to offend me. But lately I feel that I'm not good enough and always will be in their shadow. Please CMV
