Two people become friends by making fun of the same person. They continue to grow a stronger friendship by making fun of more people. I think this is wrong. It's mean and it promotes bullying. Back when I was in high school, people would always make friends like this. Maybe adults still do it, but less obvious. I would see teens laughing at others behind their backs, and that person was just being themselves. I think it's a terrible way to make friends because of how cruel it is on other people. It creates these inside jokes that are harmful to others. I dislike people who are sometimes proud of having friendships where they can always laugh at others.
