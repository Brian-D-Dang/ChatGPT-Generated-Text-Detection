So, son. We've got a situation yet We're not sure what might occur We know in the next twenty minutes You will die Don't give me that face, you're a child right now. Stop treating this valuable time like a broken toy on the floor. No point in tears, son. The police have already arrived. You had a burglar? Fork on the socket? No? Feeling suicidal? Homicidal? Genocidal? No? Look, son. In eighteen or so lousy minutes you will rise above the singe and smell and swooping beige spattered with the blood of a thousand innocents that is our mortal life. You will see green shores. And rise from a sea flecked with coral. And enter the house And all will be fine. They're waiting Look, son. Just there. That's your body bag, right? All will be fine. Standard operating procedure, son. Standard procedure. You're on your own, at the end.
