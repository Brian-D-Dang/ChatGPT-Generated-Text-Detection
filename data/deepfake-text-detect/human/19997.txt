My general point of view is rooted in the belief that as Americans we have the ability to change our policies and that is through voting. In light of the recent events in Ferguson and Baltimore, I repeatedly here complaints about local corruption and institutional racism found in local officials against African Americans. My problem with this is that African Americans have a reasonable and non-violent way of changing this and that is through voting. Take Ferguson as an example. Ferguson's population is 67 black, but only 6 of African-Americans voted in the 2013 municipal elections. Right there they had their chance to change the institution but through their apathy they choose not to. I don't think people who don't actively try to change their situation should have the right to complain about these problems.
