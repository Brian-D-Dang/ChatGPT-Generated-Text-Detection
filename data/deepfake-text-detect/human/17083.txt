This paper proposes an adaptive human pilot model that is able to mimic the crossover model in the presence of uncertainties. The proposed structure is based on the model reference adaptive control, and the adaptive laws are obtained using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability criteria. The model can be employed for human-in-the-loop stability and performance analyses incorporating different types of controllers and plant types. For validation purposes, an experimental setup is employed to collect data and a statistical analysis is conducted to measure the predictive power of the pilot model.
