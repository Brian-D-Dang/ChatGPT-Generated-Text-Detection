I see no reason that the KXL should be so hated, besides the (in my opinion unjust, but that's a topic for another CMV) practice of Imminent Domain being used. I oppose Imminent Domain for obvious reasons, but I see no reason why people are against the pipeline for things like environmental reasons. First off, the oil is being mined anyways- it's going to happen, period. This pipeline will do nothing but speed up the way it's transported, and make it safer than road-travel. Secondly, there's already a pipeline, it just takes a much less direct route. That's the whole point of the KXL, is to give it a direct route, with a faster flow. And finally, it will, in fact, create jobs. Mostly temporary, but some will be permanent. That point in itself is enough to get many people on-board, including myself. Again, my only complaint is the use of Imminent Domain, but that's not a thing that's going away any time soon. But if anyone has any unmentioned reasons, then I'd be happy to hear them. So far, though, I haven't heard anything to change my view that the KXL is a good idea. EDIT: Eminent- blame Chrome Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
