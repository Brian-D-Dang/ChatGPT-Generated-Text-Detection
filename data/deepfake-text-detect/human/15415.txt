The hostess was not able to help when we asked where our party's reserved table was located (probably because no one updated the iPad, she was completely incapable of problem solving) So we missed the surprise for our friends b day because not a single staff member was able or willing to assist us, they avoided eye contact, one server actually pretended not to see me, I was 2 feet from her. Service ultimately was slow but friendly. The pretzel app was very yummy and the dinner was good, sliders. The place is too big for efficiency or they need to hire problem solvers. If you have time on your hands the food is good, loud and live music too. Only 2 stars for ruining the surprise party.
