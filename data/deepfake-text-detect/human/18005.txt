I think title 9 means well and that women should be treated equal to men, but it is unfair in its application on college sports because it ignores many facts . 1: Men are more likely to compete in sports. From a young age boys are encouraged to try sports in a way women aren't. This is definitely a problem that needs to be addressed, but by society, not the law. Since there are more men in sports the proportionality is way off, but title 9 treats it as equal. It's comparable to a hypothetical scenario where an engineering program had to contain the same number of female students as male. There's just a larger supply of guys. 2: It isn't so much that women are being empowered, but more that men are being depowered. The university I attended was forced to cut 4 men's programs as a result, no women's programs were added. 3: People watch men's sports. American culture is based around male athletes who are revered and idolized. Obviously this happens for female athletes too, but nowhere near the same level. Just try to name 3 WNBA players. Speaking of which, the WNBA actually runs a 300,000 dollar deficit every year. Why should a university have to cut programs out that are making money to fit in some that are running a deficit? I'll be honest I don't know that much about title 9 so I could be completely missing something. Please change my view!
