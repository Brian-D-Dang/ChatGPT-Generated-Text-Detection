It seems to me that we always look at improving the quality of life for the poorest citizens, but nobody dares mention reducing the lavishness of the ultra wealthy. By implementing a system that requires CEO to pay his workers more money in order to make more money himself, wealth is better distributed without removing the incentive to work hard and earn more. A 500x increase is still a huge disparity. In 2010 the CEO of Walmart made 35,000,000, the average sales associate made just over 15,000. The CEO made 2333x more than he was paying the average associate. If this limit was implemented the CEO would make a maximum of 7,500,000 if he wanted to continue paying his workers so poorly. Or he could increase their wages and at the same time increase his. It's not communism, it's moderated capitalism. I am not someone who has studied economics or business, I am coming to CMW with an open mind to learn why a system like this supposedly doesn't work. [Edit, View changed] Hello, users of CMV!
