The kilogram is the only unit that currently isn't defined by some constant of the universe. The second comes from atomic transitions, the meter by the distance light travels in some amount of time in a vacuum, the mole by the number of atoms in 12g of carbon-12. But the kilogram doesn't have a definition other than "however much the prototype kilogram weighs." It's the only one of the seven base units that is this way, and we need a definition to derive a lot of other units and ultimately do science. And it's the only one that is based on a physical object because so far no method based on a universal constant has produced a definition that is precise and consistent enough.','This video explains it very well in simple to understand terminology. they also have a lot of other good videos.
