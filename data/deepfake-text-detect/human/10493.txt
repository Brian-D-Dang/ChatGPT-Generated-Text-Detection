They haven't published much yet, but from his wording on twitter, it sounds like he DDOS'd them. A DDOS is a specific type of attack where you - very simply - send them more traffic than they can accept. It sounds dumb when congress says it, but if you picture a network as a pipe, it's easy to visualize. The pipe has a fixed amount of'bandwidth' (the amount of data that can go in and out). Normally, GoDaddy probably keeps their pipes about 5-10 full, and they have lots of pipes going to different companies, just in case a pipe breaks, their computers are still connected to the world. In this case, someone pointed a firehose (or many firehoses) at GoDaddy, and their pipes got filled, and their computers broke. Instead of pointing at the website, they seem to have pointed them at the DNS subsystem, which causes all of the clients to break, too, not just URL0. The'how' is generally complex - it's very likely that they use a'botnet' of computers. Botnets are lots of computers, generally infected by a virus or servers in datacenters that have been hacked, that can be turned onoff to attack systems at will. If you have a few thousand computers, each sending a gallon of water per minute through a pipe that holds 100 gallons per minute, it's easy to see how that pipe could overflow and break. It's an oversimplification, but that's what ELI5 is for, right? This isn't a new or novel attack. There are lots of ways to prevent this from happening, and a lot of people will want to know why GoDaddy was vulnerable, given how much of the internet they actually control DNS for.
