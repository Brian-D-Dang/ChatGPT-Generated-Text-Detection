There is serious separation anxiety when you have to leave your stylist, with whom you have established a bond, and maybe even spilled serious personal information to. Having moved from the south, I had to leave a woman I loved and strike out into all new territory. It was the end of a 2 year relationship, and I wasn't prepared to see just any old body after that. Then I found Nicolette at MCN. She's amazing and chill and friendly and interesting and and AND she's great at her job. Also, the salon is beautiful and the stylists range in price, so if you are occasionally living from paycheck to paycheck (like me,) you can see Jenn or Kara and get a great cut without having to scrounge through your piggy bank for a little extra. However, if you don't like dogs, be aware that Josie, the bulldog, is frequently around and about.
