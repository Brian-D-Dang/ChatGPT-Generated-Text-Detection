I posted this comment that describes my view in another subreddit and it got downvoted with no explanation as to why people disagreed with me: I can not understand it. Why would anyone who is not trying to get pregnant (or on birth control and with a confirmed healthy partner) not wear a condom? It is not awkward or hard to bring up and it has never "ruined the mood" for me. It's as simple as being in a hot session where you know things are about to get hotter and saying "Do you have a condom?" Of course it helps to try to keep onesome of your own around so that if they say "no" you can say "that's okay, I do" and continue on. And if you end up in a situation where neither of you have a condom, there are other good options that are not just having sex without one anyway. There are other satisfying sexual acts that can be engaged in intercourse's stead. You can put the act on hold temporarily and go get your penis gloves. Or you can just postpone it to another time when you're more prepared. OR even just give the opportunity a pass. It may not be exactly what you wanted, or how you pictured it, BUT IT IS WORTH IT. There is no lay worth disregarding safeguards against pregnancy and disease. This is the conclusion that I have come to, but if anyone can provide a good argument as to why unprotected sex (other than in the situations I mentioned) is a good idea and worth it, I will certainly change my mind. To quote Tim Minchin, "You show me that it works and how it works, and when I recover from the shock, I will take a compass and carve "fancy that" on the side of my cock!" I'm interested in legitimate arguments for unprotected sex, but I would also like to know the different reasons people currently engage in it (even if it isn't a good or convincing reason), just for the reference.
