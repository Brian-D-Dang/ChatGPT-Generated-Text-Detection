In practically all sports, world records - and the general levels of achievement - held by men are higher than those held by women. An average man is taller and stronger than an average woman, and a woman capable of physically overpowering a man is always an unusual freak case. Men have it easier when it comes to reproduction, as if a woman wanted 15 children, it would take her a lifetime of effort, while a man could do the same within a year and not even know it. Being stuck with the resulting spawn can doubtfully be considered a benefit. Men's capability to reproduce also doesn't diminish with age. While it can be argued that there are skills and capabilities that men and women are equal in, the skills that women are supposed to be better at are fewer than those of men, and in general society almost completely useless, such as better colour vision. Though equal societies have existed, there has never been a civilisation in which women would have been the dominant sex. And while I don't condone wiping out 52 of the species, I believe that being a female human is a hinderance. A handicap that doesn't give you special parking. Change my view.
