Specifically, I think with this standard, either both people should be considered to be raped, or neither should. I just want to clarify, if somebody is passed out, or if verbal consent is not obtained, it is definitely rapesexual assault. However, if two people are drunk and consent to sex, then they have made the choice to do so. The law (USA) says that if I get drunk and vandalize something, I am responsible for my actions, even though I was drunk. The law says that if I get drunk and drive a vehicle, I am responsible for my actions even though I was drunk. If I get drunk and consent to sex, I am responsible for my action even though I was drunk, even if I regret it the next day. The law clearly makes it so that people cannot use the "I was drunk" excuse to avoid owning up to their actions and decisions except in this case. It doesn't help that there is a huge double standard among men and women. We usually hear about women regretting their decision the next day and we never see the man be able to counter with "I was drunk too, she raped me." Another aspect I would like to point out are the stereotypical (just using men as an example, either gender can do this to either gender) men who try and get a women to drink more so she consents to sex. If the women is still consenting and the man is still consenting, I think this makes the man an asshole trying to take advantage of a woman, but not a rapist or sexual assaulter. She is not passed out and she gave a verbal yes. A decision was made was made while both parties were under the influence of alcohol and these people are responsible for their actions, just like they would be if the committed a crime. CMV.
