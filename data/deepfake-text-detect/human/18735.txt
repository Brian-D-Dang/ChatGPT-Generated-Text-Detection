I think that according to any fair criterion of what makes a view valuable or convincing, their way of looking at the world is just as valid as mine. But I don't really want to have this conclusion - I want to go back to feeling as if religious people and I have a real quarrel. My agnosticism is based on the simple lack of a convincing argument for the existence of God. I've looked into all of the most popular ones - ontological argument, cosmological argument, design argument, argument from consciousness... in their various forms, and I'm just not convinced by any of them. Not only that, but I don't think religious believers should be convinced by them, because I think they're based on poor reasoning. However, for those that have felt like they've had divine revelations or experiences that have convinced them of God's existence, I think their views are perfectly justified. I just haven't had an experience I interpreted as having religious meaning, despite having felt a connection with the numinous many times. So, non-rhetorical question: Why should I think people who're convinced of God's existence have a less valid view than mine?
