Freedom of speech is paramount in the US, as is the Freedom of Religion. There are limits to free speech, such as it being illegal to slander someone, being illegal to intentionally cause an unwarranted panic (yelling fire in a theater), or to call for violence against someone. Harassment is a nebulous area. Actual harassment when you are following someone and attempting to prompt them into violence is illegal. Calling everyone of group an idiot or saying they should leave the country is not illegal, that is a right of free speech. You also cannot discriminate against someone of a protected class (ethnicity, gender, age, disability, religion) unless there is a legitimate reason to require the discrimination. So if you are a religious organization you can require everyone who works for you to be a member of said religion. If you work in a job that requires living 200 lbs and climbing ladders can require you be able to do those things. As for religions who have discriminatory practices. The US government can in no way prohibit the free exercise of a religion and its practices up until the point that those practices put the public at risk. So they can stop human sacrifice, but they cannot stop a church from being whites only. They can stop uncontrolled burnt offerings on an alter (due to fire risk) but they cannot stop a synagogue from requiring the men wear yarmulke.', "URL0 Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances we do have a law that says you can practice any religion you want...it's called the first amendment
