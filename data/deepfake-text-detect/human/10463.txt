Are you talking about TMJ? TMJ (Temporomandibular Joint Disorders) can cause clicking, pain, jaw locking, etc. because the'hinge' of the jaw is misaligned or otherwise dysfunctional. I had pretty severe TMJ (with pain, clicking and jaw locking) as a teenager and one of the ball joints on my jawbone was ground flat on one side due to constant friction with the other half of the joint. Once I had braces put on my teeth my bite shifted and I have had almost no problems since.
