When I go on Wikipedia, most of the stuff is cited and I feel as if every fact stated is backed up by a source. People say that anyone can change it, but usually, it is either blatantly obvious or quickly reverted. When I read something on Wikipedia, I automatically assume it is the truth. I understand that most of the stuff written is by mundane people, but the fact that an overwhelming amount of people have confronted me that the site has little value to knowledge absolutely astounds me. Sure, it's written by everyday people, but it has a sophisticated enough moderation to make it as truthful as possible in which I find a highly reliable source of knowledge.
