They made him out to be some sort of evil person. The article seems very biased. To me, just because you made money from stock of a gun company who's product was used in a shooting, doesn't make you in any way responsible or supportive of the shooting. It's kinda like...say McDonald's stock went down because it became public that they were using some nasty additive responsible for a number of deaths. So you buy a bunch of stocks in McDonalds when they are down, knowing that they will inevitably rebound when people forget. I also made a bunch of money off of devalued gun stocks right after the shooting. I have no moral qualms about it. Zero. I think the author of the article has his head up his A.
