I strongly believe that post-secondary education is a privilege and not a right. One can still get a job or start a business with just a high school diploma. Many self-made millionaires only have a high school degree and have been able to succeed through determination. Furthermore, the economy is bad enough without having the government subsidize post-secondary education through taxes. If a student is interested in exploring this opportunity but isn't financially able to they could always apply to one of the many scholar ship opportunities, grants and student loans. Also, if students are given secondary education opportunities for free, they will inevitably take it for granted and not value it as one who is paying for a higher education. I live in Toronto, Ontario and I am currently in gr 11. I was talking to some friends recently but their opinion differed. Help me see their reasoning.
