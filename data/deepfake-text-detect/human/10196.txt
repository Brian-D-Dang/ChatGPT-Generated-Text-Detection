First, I know "egalitarian" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word "feminism" has, but I feel like it's time for a change. The internet has caused a lot of voices that may otherwise be drowned out come to the forefront, such as the feminist extremists (or "feminazis" if you will). It seems that because of this many people are being turned off by the idea of feminism (myself included) because they associate that word with the people that blame all of life's problems on the patriarchy. My friends are starting to joke about feminism and I see more people mocking it every day. I believe it is due to the extremists, and how polarizing and antagonistic a lot of their views are. This stubbornness to stick to the name is causing a lot of people to dismiss, or even despise, the movement and is hurting it's support. I feel that if true feminists were willing to distance themselves from the "feminazis" it would stop a lot of animosity people have towards them. This might end up being as simple as calling it something different, because maybe the only ones that would keep the term "feminism" would be the extremists. They might want to retain the name so as to not give in or lose the fight. Of course there is no way of telling, and they may very well go along with the "true feminists" and call themselves egalitarian anyways. In either case, I feel like it would be beneficial to cause a clear divide between feminists and feminazis in order to garner more support and to have feminist ideas to be taken more seriously. Change my view guys!
