While it is true that you will eventually leave traditional education establishments and maybe push on to a couple of years of higher education (Collages, Tech Schools, ETC), I feel that many people feel that it ends there. I have always felt that it never ends, and that people can learn anything and everything if they feel compelled too push themselves. Keeping yourself just limited to what you learn over the time you go through the normal school is dumb and overall ruins what we as a society can achieve. Hello, users of CMV!
