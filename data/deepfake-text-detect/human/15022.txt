Just walk away. While my specific waitress was doing her job everyone else was clearly slacking. The food was bad even for a chain, and the worst part might have been one of the idle wait staff making loud clicking noises with his mouth to our annoyance even after we made it clear that it was aggravating. This was the worst place I visited in Vegas, and maybe one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant.
