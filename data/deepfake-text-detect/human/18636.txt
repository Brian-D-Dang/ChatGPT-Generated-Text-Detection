This is a long-held belief of mine and just one of many gripes about movie theaters. Movie theater seats are first-come, first-serve. If I want to get there 20 minutes early for the ability to leave a one-seat buffer on either side of me, that's my choice. That's the seat I have chosen. If you show up after the scheduled start time of the movie, I believe that you forfeit any ability you may have had to kindly ask people to scoot over to create more seats for you to fit. If you want to guarantee two seats together at a popular movie, show up earlier. If you're late, you should take what you can get and not be rude by asking someone who has been sitting there already for 30 minutes to move over to accommodate you. The trigger of this particular rant occurred a few nights ago when a THEATER EMPLOYEE escorted late arrivals into the theater 20 minutes late and proceeded to shout at the people in front of us to move over to make two seats for these people. If it had happened to me, I would have ripped the theater manager a new asshole. To be clear, I am literally saying that this practice should be disallowed entirely. People should NOT BE ABLE to ask others to move if the movie or previews have already started. And the request certainly should not be coming from a theater employee. If you're late, take what you can get and don't be an asshole. Things that will not change my view: saying that leaving seats on either side of you is also an dick move saying that even if everyone gets there early, someone is going to be out of luck pointing out that disallowing this practice is likely unenforceable
