The majority of redditors are just white suburban kids that have a very narrow minded view of the world. If you think about reddit in this way, most if not all reddit comments you come across really makes sense in that context. It makes sense that the majority of AMA's that commercialize and plug in their own products are catered towards that demographic. It makes sense that the movement towards a more liberal viewpoint, of environmental conservation, and homosexual rights are limited to whatever they know between 2009 - 2014 It makes sense, that "slut shaming is bad" makes the front page twice, with any opinions opposing this downvoted. With any other ethnic or cultural background, this would never be agreed on. CHANGE MY VIEW. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things. Firstly, please remember to [read through our rules] . If you see a comment that has broken one, it is more effective to report it than just downvote it. Speaking of which, [downvotes don't change views] !
