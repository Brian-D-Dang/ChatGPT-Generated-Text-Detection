Great store with a lot of cool clothes! It is true with all the other reviews...the regular price clothing can be a lil steep but you have to check out the sales rack. I got a pair of J Brand Jeans that were originally 225 for only 68!!! I seriously should have considered buying two pairs! The customer service is really great and everyone is very helpful and finding your size and recommending items. If you're in the mall, be sure to just stop in and check out the sales section...definitely worth your time!
