I'm referring to this one: What would happen if you tried that in real life: the dog would get a bunch of severe health problems, become obese, and soon die. Basically a situation the complete opposite of the happy and healthy one that is shown on screen. This is the general reason I hate it, though I'm not sure why specifically. One possible issue is that it will cause pet ownerschildren to mess their pets up after watching this but I don't think that's why I care (or it is a reason I would consider for disliking the film, but it is not the reason that I currently despise the film). I guess the actual point of the movie is some dog-human love and whatnot but they could easily have done it about something else, that in real life wouldn't end up killing the dog. So please CMV or else I'll have to think about how horrible the film is until I eventually forget about it.
