Well, Reddit, I can't see how it is widely appreciated or even accepted telling the whole islamic community "If our cartoons offend you, don't look at them." How is this different to tell ethnic minorities being offended by racist statements they should just not listen to racist people? My view (yes, this is about Charlie Hebdo, and no, I'm not charlie): Cartoons don't affect the degree of humiliation in any message. If you say something, be it in a humorous satire or in a serious speech, you should always be respectful to others. So if someone gets offended by something we ourselves wouldn't consider offending, we should overthink our situation, should consider the loss we suffer from not printing such cartoons in contrary to the benefit of the people that are offended by these actions. Please change my view. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things. Firstly, please remember to [read through our rules] .
