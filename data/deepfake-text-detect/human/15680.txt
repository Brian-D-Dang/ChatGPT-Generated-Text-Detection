I wanted a reasonably priced hotel in the heart of the Strip. I thought the price was a little less than I would have went for, but I took it anyway. It is the Flamingo, right? WHAT A MISTAKE! I began having second thoughts when I walked through the casino to the elevators; the check-in was ok, though they wanted to charge me extra for being an hour early and sent me to get a rewards card to avoid the fee. The casino has a worn, depressing, smoked-out truck stop feel to it, like the Golden Nugget. OK, I told myself. But it is cheaper. I boarded the elevator with my friends, they were staying elsewhere and wanted to see the Flamingo for the first time. The elevators closed, revealing kick marks, scuffs, dirt and smears all over the interior. They opened to reveal carpet taped down with old duct tape. We walked past the old vending and ice machines, right in the hall, no room of their own. It gets better! As we entered my room, there was a nasty fake fur godawful throw laying across the bed, sticky stuff on the floor, mildew around the tub, blistered ceiling and cracks above the shower, and the closet door was hanging off its rollers. A look inside revealed that the entire door was peeling apart. The safe was useless- swipe any casino card from any casino (it asks you to swipe a credit card- yeah, right!!) and it will open. The lamps had not been dusted in at least months and the tables were dingy, as if wiped with a dirty rag. The floors are dark fake wood vinyl...depressing as the room itself. Nice towels- they were better than the Wynn's inexplicable sandpaper ones- but the damage was done. I was mortified and embarrased. I reported the problems to a Jennifer who could not have cared less. They didn't offer a refund- only an upgrade next time. Fool me once, shame on you- fool me twice, shame on me. To think for twenty bucks more a night I would have avoided all this at any other surrounding hotel. Lesson learned.
