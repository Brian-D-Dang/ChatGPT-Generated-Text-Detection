I only have the power to offend you with words if you give me that power. Words are ultimately just symbols. WE give them meaning. With that being said, symbols can be a very subjective thing, no? For instance, the cross could represent 2 different things to 2 different people. If you hear the word "faggot," and are offended, you are only empowering the traditional meaning and use of that word further. If you choose to not let if phase you, you are taking that power back. Even better, we can redefine the symbols and use them to serve our own purposes, like the word nigga being used as a term of endearment in black culture (in america at least). I cannot offend you without your consent. Same goes for any other "offensive" word. So while I respect others who would rather not hear such words, I find it hard to sympathize with them. I don't use such language more for the sake of courtesy rather than an actual opposition to them. I'm interested in opposing viewpoints. Maybe I'm wrong, you know? However, if I am, I have never been convinced of otherwise, and this is a discussion I've had many times. Many people don't see eye to eye with me on this. Maybe it has more to do with my perspective? Edit: I've read all the responses, but I feel many of them overlap and I don't want to be talking the same points with 4 or 5 different people at a time. However, there was one user that pointed out how my rational and technical approach to this issue doesn't fit with the irrational nature of emotional responses, which I still can't say changed my line of thinking but allowed me a better understanding as to why. I think that's as close as we're gonna get to seeing eye to eye on this. I just subscribe to a different school of thought than most of you, so I'm gonna have to just agree to disagree. However, I appreciate all your responses and inputs, even if you think I may be kind of an asshole lol. Thank you very much for your time and efforts!
