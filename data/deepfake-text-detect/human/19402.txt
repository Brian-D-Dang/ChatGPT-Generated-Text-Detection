Yes. There is no relationship without possessing selfishness. We all assume that mother's love for their children is the purest love on earth but if we dive into this relationship, the selfishness will appear. For example, when a baby cries, herhis mother feels pain inside that push the mother to take care of baby. This act is because of the mother's wish to decreasing her pain. Mom does it for herself. It is obviously selfishness. We are all selfish humanbeing whether or not be aware of it. Change my view or change yours. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
