First, your city has to decide that it wants to build and maintain a municipal network. Good luck with that. Then, it has to make sure it's even legal, because the big industry providers have lobbied to make it illegal or damn hard for anyone to get into the market. Then, your city has to pass a tax ordnance to pay for it. With the bookkeeping out of the way, there WILL be a lot of guys in orange vests laying cable everywhere. In my old hometown, they bid for Google to run their initial fiber network and suggested they could pull cable through the cities street light conduits. If your city doesn't have such a convenient option, it can lay conduit, or more likely, they'll just use an insulated buried cable. They use a machine that is a diesel powered vibrating knife, attach the cable to the bottom, and drag the thing down through the soil. There are also diggers that look like chainsaws that can make narrow trenches. And yes, fiber is fiber. It's glass (or acrylic, but I don't think they use that in this application). And every house needs it's own line back to the hub. Your city would probably wire up whole neighborhoods and subdivisions, and all that would come to a local hub, a box where all the fiber comes together and gets "multiplexed" onto higher bandwidth fiber, because one wire is better than hundreds, in terms of cost and complexity. These hubs will connect to routers, which are themselves connected to each other and to "peers," aka other networks, other service providers, the internet.
