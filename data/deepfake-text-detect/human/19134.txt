Individually, both superheroes are interesting and can have great stories (my personal favorites are The Dark Knight Returns and All-Star Superman), but putting them on a team together makes the suspension of disbelief really hard. I'm not saying that the dynamic between them doesn't work, it does and really well. I'd even go so far as to say that some of the best DC moments involve both of them. The problem arises when they're teaming up against common foes. This applies to the rest of the Justice League as well; you have this handful of heroes like Superman and Wonder Woman that are such a different "power level" as the rest of the members that they become vestigial. "Oh you can fight really well with knives? Well I'm essentially a God." It often feels like a contrivance when writers find a way for Batman or The Green Arrow to be fighting the same villains as Superman or The Flash. That's not even going into the problem of "why doesn't Superman just beat up all the villains in Gotham?" Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
