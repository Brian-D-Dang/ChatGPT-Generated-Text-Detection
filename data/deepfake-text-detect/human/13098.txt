There is a moment after Elle wakes up where she thinks she is still dreaming. Her alarm is still going on the nightstand. The strains of Stand By Me are familiar. Usually by this time Alice would be up and boiling water. She can feel a slight breeze from the cracked window, a bird wailing somewhere outside. The apartment is quiet. Elle blinks rapidly. There is nothing. She runs her hands along the blanket. Wiggles her feet to fight the asinine fear that they have cesed to exist. Someone shuffles in the next room (it must be Alice) but they are coming closer. The song continues to play. They knock. Elle looks to where the door would be. "Come in." Her voice is rough. "Elle?" Alice calls. "Eleanor? I can't see." She is crying. "I know." Elle swallows. Her throat feels constricted. "I can't either." The floor creaks as Alice approaches. Elle feels sick. Her mouth tastes scummy. Elle reaches to her through the dark. "I'm here," and Alice grabs her hand. Elle feels the bed shift as Alice sits. "Have you called work?" The hand squeezed. "Yes. Cam answered. He can still see, but there's...... There's no one else. He's been calling every house in town." "That's rough." "Patty wants to have a meeting. Tomorrow night at the high school." "I don't know how to get there." Elle says. "Me either." comes Alice's voice. They sit in the dark and laugh.
