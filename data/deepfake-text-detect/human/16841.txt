Random Constraint Satisfaction Problems exhibit several phase transitionswhen their density of constraints is varied. One of these threshold phenomena,known as the clustering or dynamic transition, corresponds to a transition foran information theoretic problem called tree reconstruction. In this article westudy this threshold for two CSPs, namely the bicoloring of k-uniformhypergraphs with a density lpha of constraints, and the q-coloring ofrandom graphs with average degree c. We show that in the large k,q limitthe clustering transition occurs for lpha rac{2{k-1k} (ln k lnln k gamma{ m d} o (1 , c q (ln q ln ln q gamma{ m d}o (1 , where gamma{ m d} is the same constant for both models. Wecharacterize gamma{ m d} via a functional equation, solve the latternumerically to estimate gamma{ m d} pprox 0.871, and obtain an analyticlowerbound gamma{ m d} ge 1 ln (2 (sqrt{21 pprox 0.812. Ouranalysis unveils a subtle interplay of the clustering transition with therigidity (naive reconstruction) threshold that occurs on the same asymptoticscale at gamma{ m r}1.
