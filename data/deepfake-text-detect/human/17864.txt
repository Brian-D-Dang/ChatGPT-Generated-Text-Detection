It has occurred to me that some random animal without higher cognitive abilities will lead a happier life than a human who has to constantly reassess life and understands death and loss, who feels hopelessness and defeat, even alongside the occasional love and victory. The "dumb" animal, on the other hand, doesn't have to deal with reasons behind everything, but rather feels things as they come, and has no sense of the deeper perceived problems of existence that intelligence brings. An ignorant person would potentially have the same outlook, and thus would lead a happier, more blissful life. CMV.
