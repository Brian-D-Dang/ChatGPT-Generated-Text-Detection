Margarita pizza was like out of a box from grocery sauce. The tofu fries tasted weird. The hummus was not authentic. The smoothies were watered down all I can taste was the powder or syrup they used to blended. The chicken breast that my sister got was sooo small it looked like it was for a 6 year old child not an adult. It was very over priced for juice bar food we spend almost 50 for the both if us for lunch the funny thing we were still hungry the portion are really small. We really want it to like this new place, but it's not for us.
