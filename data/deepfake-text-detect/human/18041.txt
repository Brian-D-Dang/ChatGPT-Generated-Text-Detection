Reason 1 - Most posts on Cake Day are about either their Cake Day or how they couldn't think about something for their Cake Day. They don't add any real substance to the Reddit Community. Reason 2 - In one of the FAQ that Reddit has put out, they ascertain that Karma is simply a by-product of being awesome. Cake Days, however, are designed specifically for someone to procure Karma in the case that they typically do not get much of it on daily basis. If Reddit doesn't want to make getting Karma the main reason for posting something, why have a Cake Day, that does exactly that?
