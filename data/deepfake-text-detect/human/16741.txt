Long Term Evolution (LTE) is expanding its utilization in unlicensed band by deploying LTE Unlicensed (LTE-U) and Licensed Assisted Access LTE (LTE-LAA) technology. Smart Grid can take the advantages of unlicensed bands for achieving two-way communication between smart meters and utility data centers by using LTE-ULTE-LAA. However, both schemes must co-exist with the incumbent Wi-Fi system. In this paper, several co-existence schemes of Wi-Fi and LTE technology is comprehensively reviewed. The challenges of deploying LTE and Wi-Fi in the same band are clearly addressed based on the papers reviewed. Solution procedures and techniques to resolve the challenging issues are discussed in a short manner. The performance of various network architectures such as listen- before-talk (LBT) based LTE, carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMACA) based Wi-Fi is briefly compared. Finally, an attempt is made to implement these proposed LTE-Wi-Fi models in smart grid technology.
