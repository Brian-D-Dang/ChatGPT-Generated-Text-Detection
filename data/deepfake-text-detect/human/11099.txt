Leaving a country is typically labelled as "defecting" if it is done due to political reasons. Essentially, the person who defects leaves Country A, and typically will never return. What could go right? Well, perhaps their new-found freedom. What could go wrong? If they left their country while wanted, they could be hunted down. That's the easiest way I can describe it, others feel free to correct me. Examples of defectors include PFC Joe Dresnok of the US army, who fled to North Korea from the south in the 60s (70s?) and is living there ever since.
