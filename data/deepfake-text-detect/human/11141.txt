most cases take a long time to come to trial. Boston bombing and OKC bombing were both pretty speedy when compared to the average. Courts have huge backlogs, and even minor criminal matters - a trial over a traffic ticket - can easily have a year or more between arraignment and hearing. There's a whole lot of reasons for it, but the ones that come to mind: Court time is expensive and scarce Seating a jury is a major pain, and again, expensive. The lawyers for both prosecution and defense have their own workloads and fixed dates they can't change Defendants can ask for a "speedy trial," but in doing so they give up some abilities to do evidence discovery that could be to their advantage. Disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer and do not play one on TV.', "There is a rule that you can't try someone for the same crime twice (double jeopardy), so you have to make sure that you have ALL the evidence you need to get it right the first time. Also, there are a lot of hearings and other procedure where what evidence is admissible or not is decided, etc. Everything has to be right the first time of the defense can call the prosecutors on a technicality or point to some missing evidence. The burden of proof is on the state, so if they can't prove beyond reasonable doubt that the perpetrator did the crime (and there weren't certain extenuating circumstances or problems with how the perpetrators were tried), the perpetrator can go free.," "If you're the bostom bomber, what's the hurry to go to trial? When the trial finishes, you're going to get a jail sentence of a few hundred years or execution. If you stall as much as possible, witnesses die, move out of the area, forget details, etc. Evidence gets lost, damaged, tainted. The defense has every advantage in delaying the trial as long as possible. In this case, his lawyers have only one goal, keep him out of prison for as long as possible, or try and get the shortest jail sentence possible.
