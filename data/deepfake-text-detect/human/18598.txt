editi appreciate the conversation. My battery died last night, but I will get to everyone's post. Thanks! Yes, I'm anti gay. I think homosexuality is disgusting. I think a cause that had genuine beginnings, (the lgbt push for equal federal rights) but it has been commandeered by people, organizations, and corporations who couldn't care less about the actual day to day plight of gay people, and are only interested in dealing with a lucrative opportunity. I think words like hate, homophobic, bigot,and etc. have been introduced into the discourse to create division, not understanding and respect. I don't hate, fear, or discriminate against gays, outside of my mind. I won a "call of the day" award from some radio host on msnbc named Stephanie or something. I said I disagreed with homosexuality, but you can't legislate morality. If I were elected president, I would quit the next day, because I'm a human like every other human, and I won't force people to live a certain way. But I am anti gay. That's no reason for us to be enemies. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
