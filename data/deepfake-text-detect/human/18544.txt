This issue arose in [my previous deafness CMV] , which failed to change my views. It should be a simple train of logical thought. People are not allowed to wear earplugs or headphones while driving. The justification for this is that hearing is a fundamental sense necessary to drive. Deaf people, by definition, cannot hear. Deaf people, lacking a fundamental sense necessary to drive, should not be allowed to drive. Some more specific risks that deaf drivers pose source] : Talking with their hands, when they should be on the wheel. Trying to lip read a passenger while driving. Not being able to hear emergency vehicles coming. Not being able to call for help if their car breaks down. Not being able to talk to an officer if they are pulled over. Not being able to hear warnings their car is giving them. The sole argument I have seen presented against this is that deaf people are accustomed to not hearing and are better at vision. But people who become deaf later in life are used to hearing, so at the very least they should not be allowed to drive. And this same logic could be applied to say that blind people should be allowed to drive, or that "I always wear headphones while driving" should be a valid excuse. Edit: at the advice of a commenter, a [study] by the California DMV found that deaf male drivers have twice the accident rate of hearing male drivers. Hello, users of CMV!
