Prisons and prisoners take up a great deal of taxpayer money to maintain and they do very little while in prison. Prisons themselves serve as high security dorm rooms, since inmates have the chance at furthering their education, finding faith, and having structured social interaction. If inmates are forced to work, the nation will be able to increase its exports and "made in USA" products. Workers would not be paid, because the prison serves as their home. If we're paying for them to sit in a cell and rot for the rest of their lives, we might as well force them to do something productive. This wouldn't apply to petty things, but to longer sentences and life sentences.
