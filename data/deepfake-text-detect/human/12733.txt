"But Daddy, there are so many doors, they go on forever!" Ah yes, I can see them now. There are quite a lot of them! I don't know if they go on forever, but there's only one way to find out! "But Daddy, I'm scared of what's behind this door." Don't be silly, that door is not even real, how can you be afraid of what is behind it? "But Daddy, it IS real!" The idea of it is real, and the feeling from that idea is real, but the idea is only an idea. There are a million variations of that idea, each equally scary. Fear is only another door in which you must open. You might be pleasantly surprised with what lay behind some of these fear locked doors. "I've watched you unlock some of them! You're so brave, but Daddy, how are you so brave?" Bravery is an illusion of understanding, which is usually good enough to dismiss fears created by the ego. Bravery is being scared and continuing on with faith in success. "If you say so, Daddy." Now watch carefully, listen to what I have to say, and focus precisely. Everyone has a museum behind their eyes; every exhibit ever imagined: real or not real, currently existing, previously existing and will exist one day. "I see mommy!" Yes you would, she would be an exhibit. "I do miss her." As do I, my daughter. As do I. "I miss you too Daddy." I'll always be here for you. "One day I will grow old and forget you too, like with Grandpa and Grandma." I suppose you will.
