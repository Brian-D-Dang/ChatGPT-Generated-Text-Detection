I would like to change my mind on this issue, I hold my opinion because: the healthcare system is a disgrace. How on earth can a government of one of the most powerful countries in the world not look after its own citizens? Apparently roughly 40 of the population are creationists. University fees are ridiculous, and just create a cycle of rich people getting good jobs and poor people working crap jobs. is there a way for a poor person to make a proper life? ridiculous levels of obesity and based on who I've met europeans just seem to be a better educated bunch.
