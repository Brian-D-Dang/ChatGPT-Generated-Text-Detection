Used to be a regular at bazix. But now the servers here are disgusting. Rude and gives you an attitude especially the female waitresses (especially the one with the brown, crooked teeth) Sorry I'm calling you out! She charged me and my friends for everything without even telling us. And talks back rudely to us and yelled. WOWW... She got lucky we tipped her 2. Food is over rated here and wayy overpriced. It's even empty here now on the weekends (when it used to be packed). It's EMPTY HERE NOW. Only old folks come and eat and talk. That's telling you something. Theres a reason why people don't come here anymore!
