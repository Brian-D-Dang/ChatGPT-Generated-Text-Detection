After getting back from Golden Carrol, my father had two curb checks, ran a stop sign, and merged into someone else's lane. He's 78, and to get a better understanding of why I think its his age that's affecting his driving and not his actual ability: He's retired GM truck driver, and has over 35 plus year experience driving 18 wheelers; he has a spotless driving record, and I can only recount 1 accident when I was younger; he takes (took) extreme pride in his driving ability.Over the past 20 yrs I seen his mental ability and reflexes take a dive due to poor health. He also has back and leg problems. I feel like his inability to drive safely might put him in harm or harm others. California has already in acted similar laws, and traffic accidents have lowered by 5.I put the question to you reddit, do you think senior citizens should have to take a competence test, i.e. written test, vision test, and driving portion to insure their safety and the safety of other motorist? Edit; Oh wow, first thread that actually exceeded 100. Thank you for all the input.
