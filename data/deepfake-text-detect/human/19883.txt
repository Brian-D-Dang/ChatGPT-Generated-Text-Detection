I feel like people who choose such majors are setting themselves up for failure in corporate America. Complaining about not having a job or working at fast food joints after graduating is their fault. These majors are useless in a world that favors degrees which are pragmatic and useful (i.e. IT, engineering, health sciences). I've noticed that in the current economic situation, those with a degree in the "hard" sciences hold their own better following graduation. The rigorous and competitive nature that entail these majors directly forces students to learn and adapt, lest they fail. This is not to say that in the "soft" sciences, competition is absent. The difference is that in the hard sciences, competitive nature is the standard, in which holding a decent GPA, having the proper techniques that (some say unfortunately) allow oneself to succeed, however unfortunate the circumstances (i.e. throw someone under the bus) are present. These skills extend themselves into the workplace environment and more, especially with the current standard of outsourcing jobs to other countries. "Soft" sciences inherently promote a lackadaisical approach, simply because of the lack of a competitive structure in which students perceive their majors.
