It boils down to one thing: After a drug has been invented we have two options: we can either test it on animals first before letting a human try it, or we can give it straight to humans and see what happens to them. Is it right to give a human a drug we haven't tested before? No. Is it right to give an animals a drug we haven't tested before? No. But we have to do one or the other. Is one of them better than the other? Yes, testing it on an animal and risking its life instead of a human's is the better option. Just to cover all possibilities. The last possibility is to not develop new drugs so we don't have to test them but that's just bad because even more people will die of thing we could potentially treat. Hello, users of CMV!
