Because Steam is downloading your game from multiple sources at once and the computer sees this as multiple downloads, so it appears to you that Steam is going faster.','The TCP protocol divides your bandwidth equally among connections, not among programs. Every program can decide for itself how many connections it would like to open. Steam probably opens three connections and UPlay only one. Opening more than one connection has some advantages (reliability, load-balancing,...) and is probably not a deliberate attempt to prioritise itself over other downloads on the same machine.
