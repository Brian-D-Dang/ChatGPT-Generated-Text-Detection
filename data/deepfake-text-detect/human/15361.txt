Ppl were ranting about the All natural burgers - they are frozen patties. There was a long line of customers upset at the fact the food took forever. 20 min wait just for ice cream. The kicker of the whole experience was the 6 dollar burger that looks like it came from In and Out. Place is ridiculous. Wont last.
