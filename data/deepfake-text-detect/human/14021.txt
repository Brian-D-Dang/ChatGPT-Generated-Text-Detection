My friend decided on taking me to the Renaissance fair for some fun. I felt down for some time, so I thought this could be a pick me up. As I prepared my outfit, he came out and had clothes from the era. I looked at him as my facade fell beside me, and let out a big smile. With arms locked, and armed with smiles, we walked inside the fair.
