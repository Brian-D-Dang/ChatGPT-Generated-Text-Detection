Why should you feel proud of your country? Most, if not all, nations have deeply problematic chapters in their history that are by no means worth celebrating. Plus, even if there's great things in your country's history and culture, how does that give you the right to feel proud about the achievements of people you just happened to be born in the same place as? I'm not denying that there's things to celebrate in one's own culture and i'm not rooting for completely trashing the culture you were born into, i'm just saying that i think it would do everyone good to treat their country as one of many and not prioritize its good or its citizens or anything about it over others.
