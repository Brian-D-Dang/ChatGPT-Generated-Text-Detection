The US has several interests in the South China Sea. There is regular economic transport through the region, and they have several allies whose national defense and economics are based on their presence in certain regions of the SCS. Yet the US has almost no involvement, as they are allowing a regional hegemon (China) to dominate politics related to the US and its regional allies. The risk of losing access to free economic movement in the South China Sea can be greatly detrimental to many US allies, mostly due to the fact that parts of the South China Sea see more energy (Oil) related shipping traffic than the Panama Canal and the Suez Canal, and therefore should be a higher priority for the US. However, because the US is losing global dominance, they are opting to refrain from involvement in the political conflict.
