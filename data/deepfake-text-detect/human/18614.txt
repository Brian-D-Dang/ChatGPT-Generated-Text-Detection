As far as I can see, Libertarians want to do away with government. I believe that there are things far too big for private enterprise to undertake without state assistance: communications, schools, infrastructure, police, currency and finance etc. I think that Libertarians can only claim to be able to live in a truly libertarian way because a succession of governments has advanced the country to the point where they are privileged enough to live in an advanced economy in a first world society. I'm from the UK, which I guess makes me a filthy socialist.
