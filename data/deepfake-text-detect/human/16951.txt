We propose a comprehensive nonlinear ODE-based thermo-hydraulic model of a district heating system featuring several heat producers, consumers and storage devices which are interconnected through a distribution network of meshed topology whose temperature dynamics are explicitly considered. Moreover, we present conditions under which the hydraulic and thermal subsystems of the model exhibit shifted passivity properties and discuss some of the beneficial implications for decentralized control design and stability analysis. For the former subsystem, our results draw on the monotonicity attributes manifested by the mappings involved. For the latter, we propose a storage function based on the ectropy function of a thermodynamic system, recently used in the passivity analysis of heat exchanger networks. Our formal analysis is supported with numerical simulations on a case study using realistic system parameters.
