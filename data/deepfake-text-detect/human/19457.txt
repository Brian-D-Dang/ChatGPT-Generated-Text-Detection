My reasoning is simple: there is no feminism. Any argument about what feminism is, is completely baseless in that there are no rules to be a feminist, outside some nebulous definition of "advocate for women on the pretense of equality." You can get crazy with that definition. Its so broad you can argue to keep women out of colleges or at least make it harder for them because there are more female students. On top of that, you have the endless " Straw ManNo True Scotsman fallacy cycle." Feminists have protested both violently and criminally in Toronto and the first thing feminism defenders will say is "They're not really feminists" as if their small definition makes or breaks the vague ideology and who can join. I've had a "feminist" tell me I was a feminist even though I disagree with a lot of it and don't identify as one, because I support gender equality. In the end, if you want justice for everyone regardless of gender, you're not a feminist, you're just a regular person who isn't an asshole. Edit: I should have known this was down vote bait.
