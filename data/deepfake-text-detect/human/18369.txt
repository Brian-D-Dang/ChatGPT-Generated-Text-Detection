The previous national election cycle saw voter turnout of only 36 of eligible voters. Voter turnout is at record lows, and a result is the hyper-partisan government we see today. Far right and far left politicians have been able to gain office due to the fact that the far right and far left are turning out to vote far more often then moderate voters. A common complaint is that one persons vote does not matter, so many people choose not to vote. Others abstain from voting as a protest against the current state of the government. These are weak excuses to try and deflect responsibility for the political climate we have today, and the only way to create a change is to actively participate in politics, become educated about current affairs and political candidates, and vote in elections for the person you think is best suited to hold office. Edit: Many of the responses are not actually providing an answer to the question. Several of the responses talk about the issue of a two party system, but this question does not rely on what system of government is in place. Any representational democracy relies on votes, and I am specifically looking for responses that can challenge the view that voting is the best way to create change within the system, regardless of what it is.
