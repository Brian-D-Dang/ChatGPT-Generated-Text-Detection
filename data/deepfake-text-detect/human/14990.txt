I love taking my friends from out of town to Bistro Fruits Folie. It is much better than Chez Cora and rivals Eggspectations in my opinion. The servers are always super cheerful and efficient. Portions are pretty big and prices are reasonable. The food itself isn't AMAZING, but it's still good...definitely hits the spot after a night of drinking. Their roasted potatoes are great, as is their smoked salmon omlette. Definitely a place I'll be visiting again and again!
