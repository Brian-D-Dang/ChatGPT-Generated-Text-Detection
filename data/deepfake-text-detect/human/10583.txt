I grew up trilingual and today I'm in my 20s and I can still speak and understand both languages my parents taught me fluently. The biggest issue I have is vocabulary: I simply learned the vocabulary of my parents which makes sense sense I never actually formally studied their languages. It's more of a technicality though: if another native speaker from my parent's country talked to me we could communicate perfectly fine. I can pick up new words and understand them even though I never heard them before simply due to the context, and if I don't understand then I'm not so arrogant that I can't ask for them to explain. Sometimes I don't know the vocabulary to voice something so I just use what I know, and whenif I'm corrected or learn a new word I start working those into my vocabulary. It's a pretty fluid thing and not something I really think about or have to "translate" to or from. I don't think my parents did anything special to teach me. They just talked to me. They are immigrants and where they're from they speak and use three totally different languages (English nowadays). The two they taught me are their "mother tongues." I didn't actually learn English until kindergarten but you would never know that from listening to me.','You speak your mother tongue at home with your children. This lets them get started with understanding one until they go to school. They will then pick up the mainstream one from school and their surrounding which will be their dominant language, however they are still able to understand your mother language. Then you take them to a specific language school to further their understanding of your mother language.
