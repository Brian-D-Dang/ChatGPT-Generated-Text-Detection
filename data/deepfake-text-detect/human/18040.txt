First of all, I've seen his show. I enjoyed his show. I watched it a lot. After a few years of being a fan, I started to look past, "this is pretty cool," and wondered whether or not it was realistic. It really seems as though what Cesar is doing is just stopping bad behaviors temporarily. He uses methods like positive punishment, which have proven effective for human beings, but what logical reason could there be for it to have the exact same effect on dogs? Sometimes, even more effective. My most solid piece of evidence is this episode in which he helps a family, with a guy named Greg. Who is Greg? Greg is an actor. You may know him from his youtube channel, "MediocreFilms." I believe that he was hired to pretend that this dog was his. They used his real name and everything in the show, so even the dumbest internet sleuth could find the guy. I think it's kind of obvious to anyone who is skeptical, and has heard of MediocreFilms. Please Reddit. Change my view. I want to believe. edited for spelling errors
