Clara's house has a screened-in porch in back. Her cat, Snowball, is allowed out there until Clara's bedtime. One night, Snowball caught a bat on the porch and brought it in. Clara had to catch the bat with a net and set it free. Snowball can still go out, but Clara keeps the door to the house shut.
