I turned twenty-seven today. Not a major milestone like turning eighteen, or twenty-one, or even forty. I'm surprised I've managed to stay who I am this long. Especially with this power. I've had this power since I was six. Six years old. A man who's eighty shouldn't have this power! And I've had it since I was a toddler. The power to kill anyone with a single thought. Oh, you didn't use your blinker and cut me off? Boom. You're dead. Terrible waitress? You're dead. A terrorist who just blew up a school? Dead. Have you ever thought about how much a human thinks about killing other humans? In a single day? No one can count that high. And can you think how many times you've said "I wish you were dead!" When you were a kid? At least once a day by what I've seen. I haven't killed anyone. Anything. Doing so will end a life. And also mine. Not like I die if I kill someone, but I'd die. Everything I am. Everything I stand for. Will die if I use this power. So no, I don't plan on using it. I plan on staying locked in my house forever to lower the chances of me slipping up and ending a life. I turned twenty-seven today..... it's been an eternity for me. Sorry. Wrote this on mobile at work just now in notepad on my phone! Sorry if it isn't the prompt "exactly" but I got inspired. Any advice would be great!
