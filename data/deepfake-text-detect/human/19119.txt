Ok so this "view" is a bit different than most posts here. It's not so much a philosophy I hold, just something I don't fully trust but I want to! I love the idea of backing up my computer to an online server such as crashplan, but I can't help but be a little bit paranoid that it's not 100 safe. Especially with all the NSA news at the minute, it just seems like nothing can be really safe. I'm a musician and I make my living off of writing songs, the thought that someone out there could steal my material or even just listen to products that I don't want in the public domain absolutely terrifies me. I recently had trouble restoring from a time machine backup though after upgrading my hard drive and the online backup solution sounds so good. I just can't quite bring myself to trust it. Could someone more knowledgeable than me on this kind of stuff please change my view?!! EDIT: Wow. Posted this last night and woke up to some really good answers! Thanks guys! I have to go out now but I'll try to reply to them all as soon as I can. One quick note, my NSA comment seemed to have been misread. I don't mean that the NSA cares about my data. I don't think anyone wants to steal my songs either, I'm just saying that a lot of people are completely shocked by the amount of info the NSA have had access to and are storing. Now if a company as massive as that was able to obtain so much information over so many years and only now people are finding out about it, it wouldn't surprise me if companies like Crash Plan were also making copies of everyone's data and either storing it for themselves or maybe even sharing it with others. I know it's a bit of a paranoid view, but can anyone address that?
