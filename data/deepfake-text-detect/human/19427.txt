They lie to the face of someone they claim to love, make them a fucking fool, and prevent them from finding someone who would treat them with the respect they deserve by keeping them tied down. In many instances, their significant other will discover the betrayal and experience extreme heartache. Despite these facts, SO MANY people cheat on their significant others, so obviously not everyone agrees that people who cheat are worthless scumbags since they do it themselves. I just read something stating that 70 of men admitted to cheating on their wives. I doubt (hope) that the statistic isn't really that high in actuality, but even if half of all people cheat, someone out there should be able to change my view. I would honestly like to hear a different perspective; perhaps it will help me move forward after feeling like a fool for being betrayed myself.
