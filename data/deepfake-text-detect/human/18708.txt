He spends the entire song assuring a girl that she wants] it," even though she clearly doesn't. The video objectifies and sexualizes women. They're shown prancing around (near naked, of course) and are referred to as animals throughout the song. The "blurred lines" refer to those of consent. He's clearly forcing himself on her. "I know you want it"? Why would he have to repeatedly assert this if she actually wanted] it"? How could this possibly be considered anything but sexist? In its essence, this song is a man telling a woman that she wants to have sex with him when she has given no such indications. He refers to her as an animal, mentions domesticating her, and is clearly overstepping his boundaries. And I haven't even mentioned T.I.'s verse, which contains such progressive lyrics as "I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two." What about this isn't gross?
