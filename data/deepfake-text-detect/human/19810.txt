I always find it baffling that there's always advertisements about charities or Goodwill-esque organizations asking for the common person to donate when the wealthy can donate an exorbitant amount of money. I understand celebrities have a finite amount of currency, but I don't see why they can't donate a lump-sum, effectively allowing the middle and lower classes to feel less "wrong" morally by not helping a good cause. Also, a wealthy person's single contribution can easily outnumber a large amount of common donations, allowing more research and awareness to be completed at a much faster rate.
