As it stands, there are many topics of opinion which are taboo to discuss. Many of these topics have to do with sex and sexual behavior, and especially unconventional forms of sexual activity or orientations, such as ZoophiliaBestiality, Incest, Necrophilia, Pedophilia, and so on, though other restrictions exist. I think taboos exist to suppress unpopular viewpoints. No one wants to hear from someone who thinks that, say, necrophilia is okay. But people still hold those unpopular viewpoints, and, without discussion, who is to say they are not right? I freely admit, there are some topics that I am squeamish about (corophagia, for example). But I shouldn't feel that way, and I wouldn't stop such discussion. And, I do admit that some topics need to be discussed carefully (such as letting young children know about death). But though care may be necessary, an outright taboo is completely overkill. Edit: There seems to be a common misconception here. A taboo is a prevailing societal attitude which discourages someone from bringing up a subject, enforced through societal pressures. Whether you have the right to bring up those topics is an entirely different subject, falling under freedom of speech. Whether anyone listens to you or not is also an entirely different subject, and no one here (not me, certainly, and no one else I've seen) is suggesting that people should be forced to listen. Note: I used "topic of opinion" to avoid issues about discussion of, say, military troop positions and so on, which are not matters of opinion but of information - and such information is important to be kept secret. I do not believe this applies to any matter of opinion.
