There is a second mirrors behind the first which reflects less of the light. So you see a dimmer image. This mirror is set at a different angle. When you flip the switch it aligns the second mirror with your eyes while the first mirror's reflection goes elsewhere. So you see a dimmer image which will not dazzle you.
