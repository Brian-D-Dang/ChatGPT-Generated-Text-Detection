47 Million pounds is about 78 Million. General Motors (who owns Chevy) made about 155 BILLION last year in revenue. As far as they are concerned 78 Million is literally pocket change. Man Utd. is a very popular team and has a loyal fan base. Having their logo featured on Man Utd. stuff is a great deal for Chevy who gets a bunch of free publicity for (relatively speaking) pocket change. 78 Million sounds like a lot to you.... but on the level GM operates its barely noticeable if its going to something that helps the business.
