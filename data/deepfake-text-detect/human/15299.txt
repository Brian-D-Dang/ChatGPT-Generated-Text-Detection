I've been to XS twice now and both times have been nothing but great times. The layout is supposed to be the representation of a girl's body figure, which is obvious when you go to the bar. XS brings in a lot of DJs on Fridays and Saturdays so just check to see who might be there beforehand if you're not into house music and whatnot. The first time I went was back in November for my 21st birthday with my small group of girlfriends on a Saturday night. We got there around 10:30 I think, and there was hardly a line. We decided to walk to Surrender to get our hand stamps there and get free drinks before going back to XS. We came back to XS probably about 11:30 and at that point, the line was crazy. The bouncers pissed us off because we already told one of them that we were on the guest list, but he told us we couldn't pass the line because we had to show him a direct text message from the promoter we talked to. So then we had to wait for about 10-15 minutes before we could reach our promoter and skip the line. Considering that it was just a group of 4 girls, this was annoying. But once we got inside the club, we completely got in our zones and started dancing away with random people and had a good time. They were playing Top40 music which I LOVE. My friends and I ended up staying there until closing (5AM). Whew my feet hurt like hell but overall an awesome time at XS. I think every Vegas trip I make, XS will always be my defaultgo-to club.
