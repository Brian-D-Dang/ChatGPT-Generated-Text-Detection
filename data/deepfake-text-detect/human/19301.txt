It seems to me that the prevailing American attitude is that it is wrong and unrealistic to expect 18-21 year olds to live adult lives. I may be mistaken here, as I have never actually been to America and my view is largely informed by discussions on Reddit, such as [this one] . [Most countries have an age of majority of 18, whilst only 15 countries have decided upon 21] . Most of the world's youngsters manage just fine with adult life at 18, I can't think of any plausible reason why American youth would be any different. I think allowing youngsters to remain in childhood (eg financially dependent, not responsible for running their household and life, being bailed out of sticky situations they get themselves into etc.) is harmful to both the young individual and society as a whole. The youngster fails to learn life skills, and, through an absence of challenging circumstances and general life experience, fails to develop character. This stuff can be picked up later, but it's great to have it before living with a spouse, moving country, or popping out a kid. Further, a sheltered life makes it difficult to appreciate what life is like. I think that this leads to a diminished level of respect for others and a lessened sense of duty to one's community. Of course I can understand the instinct to want to protect your kids for as long as possible, but I believe that it ultimately does more harm than good. Hello, users of CMV!
