I'm about to make generalizations, and I usually hate generalizing, but I'm specifically talking about the general cases here. Stereotypes are obviously never true for everyone, but they are often based on real trends and I think this is one of those times. I think it's a pretty universally accepted stereotype that men try to work through problems logically and solve them, whereas women prefer to address and share their emotional responses to problems. The epitome of relationship troubles: Girl is upset about something, wants to share and work through feelings, guy wants to solve the underlying problem and move on, girl gets frustrated by the analytical approach guy is taking to this emotional topic and little expression of sympathy, guy gets frustrated by his efforts to solve the problem backfiring, fight ensues. The point of my CMV is that as (you guessed it) a guy, I feel like this is not simply a case of different styles or personality trends which suggest neither one is better than the other, just different. I believe the typical male approach is objectively superior because by addressing the underlying issue, the source of the negative emotions is eliminated. With the female response, even if things are mended in the short-term, they rarely are in the long-term, and a relapse into negative emotion is likely. In addition, I tend to notice the stereotypical male responses in 'good life advice' and the stereotypical female responses in 'behaviour to avoid'. I feel like a lame sexist writing this, but I'm not. I wonder if this view is linked to patriarchal culture in some way.. Please CMV Edit: I can't hand out deltas to everyone who's brought it up (or maybe I can?), but consider my view changed on the basis that the two approaches are complementary. A rational approach and an emotional approach both bring something valuable to the table.
