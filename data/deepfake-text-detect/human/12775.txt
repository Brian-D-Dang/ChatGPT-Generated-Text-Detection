What does it mean to be dangerous? I can't see the numbers in pictures or through the TV. I don't know how Hitler or Pol Pot or Charles Taylor rank, but before Eric showed up at our school I had never seen a 10 before. Most everyone I see is a one or a two. Mr. Henderson, the guy who killed his wife and family and then held off the cops for 24 hours, was only a 5. I saw him for a second as they pushed him into the back of a police car. Eric was a nice kid. He was genuinly polite and pretty smart, but not the smartest kid in school by any stretch. We had a lot of classes together and, partially due to his number I guess, he intrigued me. We became friends. We'd play Halo most afternoons. His parents even invited me to join them all on a summer vacation. They were going to travel all over the place. My parents said I couldn't go. We were all going to visit my grandma who is getting old and might not make it though another year. I was happy to see him when Eric got back. He looked a little pale and definitely jet lagged. He said he had a great time, but maybe I could come back when he was feeling a bit better. He died that night. His mom and dad and his older brother died two days later. The outbreak spead. On the news there were red cicles that seemed to center on every country they visted on their vacation. It seemed to be a mutated bird flu. The anchorman, while he was still alive, said that the CDC was looking for "patient one" in hopes that it would help them find a cure. There was a number to call. No one answered.
