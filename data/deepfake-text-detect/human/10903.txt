Not a medical professional so anyone with more knowledge please correct it: Wounds have exposed nerves. Nerves send signals through ions such as sodium and potassium; chlorine exists in the ECF. When exposed to salt, the sodium ions react with the nerves, mimicking a signal in the body and you interpret that as pain.
