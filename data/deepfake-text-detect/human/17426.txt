In the past I have tried to start reading comic books, but I find a certain hurdle that prevents me from really delving into the medium, the price. While three or four dollars is not much money on its own, the entertainment value of the product, in my experience, not worth the amount I pay. I'll use an example. Recently, I bought the first issue of the new Ms. Marvel series at 2.99. In it, there were 20 pages of story and it took me about 10-15 minutes maybe to read through the whole book. There were about four scenes in the book (the store, the house, the party, and Kamala gaining her powers), all of which served to introduce Kamala, but little else. While the narrative was entertaining, it stopped the moment it began to develop, leaving a hook for the reader to dish out an additional three dollars to further the story. Conversely, a film ticket may cost about three times as much (about seven-ten dollars depending on where and when you buy the ticket), but for that price you're getting at least an hour and a half of entertainment with a full three act story. [A book can cost between five to twenty dollars, but for that price you're getting at least several hours worth of entertainment.] . I've read other comics and I can usually finish an issue in about 10 minutes. To me, paying three or four dollars for about ten minutes of entertainment is not worth it. Hello, users of CMV!
