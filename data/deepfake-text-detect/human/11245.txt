A group of startups is using end-to-end learning to teach self-driving cars how to drive. Despite investors sinking more than 100 billion into self-driving car technology, driverless tech is still stuck in the pilot phase. The current approach to driverless car technology uses a robotics mindset, which is hard to build and maintain. The startups are building neural networks that can figure out how to drive themselves using new AI techniques. More details about the new approach and the startups trying to build the next generation of self-driving cars are available in the article.
