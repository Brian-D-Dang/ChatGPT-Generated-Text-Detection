I let my Costco membership expire when this Sam's Club near my house opened up. At first it was nice but then the honeymoon wore off. The selection was not as good and the service was horrible. It seems the last few times I have gone the person in front of me buys something from the security cage. It has taken what seems like 20 minutes for them to get the manager who has the key and get the item every time. The manager is at a podium 20 yards away and the secure cage is 20 yards in the other direction. I don't expect Olympic pace but this is not even a snail's pace. Then the service at the food counter is also horrible continuing with the theme. The employees walk around behind the counter like they are laboring just to move around and it hurts them to grab a hot dog out of the container and put it in a bun and wrapper for you. To drive it home they might throw it on the counter for you like they did for me. Even though the Costco is a few more miles away and much busier all I have to say is Costco here I come.
