Had dinner here the other night for my birthday. I've been to teppanyaki restaurants before and have had a good time as the chef always told jokes while he was cooking and really kept us entertained throwing stuff up in the air. So we decided to try Benihana's. Unfortunately, I think maybe our chef was new as he really just concentrated on his cooking and didn't tell a single joke. His performance was boring, I think he only got 2 shrimp tails in his hat! The food was very pricey, but the shrimp was tasty. You need to eat as you go otherwise the food gets cold. They brought the rice too early and it sat there getting cold while the chef was cooking the meats. They need little rice pots with a lid instead of the bowls. They also kept pushing the birthday club and the manager even came around and handed each of us a form to fill out. This just wasn't the experience I was hoping for.
