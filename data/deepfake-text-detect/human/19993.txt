If I put effort into something and as a result I get something out of it, I have a reason to be proud. I've put effort into something and it's turned out well. Surely the only things that you should be proud of are things that you've had to work hard for? But, I see many LGBT people say that they're proud of their sexuality, which I just can't get my head around. What is their to be proud about? They haven't put any work into it. Have they had to work hard to be gay? I don't feel they have a reason to be proud. CMV. edit: Actually, this could be extended to everything that we're born with. I'm black. I'm not proud of being black and I don't see why some people are. I didn't have to put any effort into being black, I was just born this way. Why should I be proud of being black?
