So today in one of my classes, someone brought this point up in a case about someone who murdered a 23-year-old Law student. "Should the murderer receive more time in prison because he ended the life of someone who was 'Doing Something' with their life and had a (more likely than not) 'Bright' Future? Compared to killing an infant or elderly person, he should receive either A) Harsher prison time (for killing the 23YO) or B) lessened time for killing the infantelderly couple." (we debate for a while (i was assigned the opposing view) He says "also to add, should criminal punishments be changed according to the criminals age? should the elderly woman really get as much time as an 20 year old? Should the 20 year old really get the time as a 40 year old? the 20 has his whole life in front of him, sure hes in prison, but this gives him better odds once out..." I can't help but agree with this point. I had a hard time debating this point because I do believe it, I think that who you act against (Kill for ex), should effect your consequence. easy example - Kill a homeless man - 10 years. Kill a doctor fresh out of college - 30 years. EDITS: basic stuff I missed.... Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
