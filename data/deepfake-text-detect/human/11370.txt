A good friend of mine recently started an ecommerce business called Drunk Shrub, it sells shrub, a tangy syrup that you can mix with alcoholic beverages or carbonated water to make soda. If you're an adventurous foodie and live in the United States, you might want to check this out. I highly recommend the raspberry mint jalapeno!
