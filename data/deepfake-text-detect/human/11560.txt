SpaceX's SN3 prototype experienced a structural failure while undergoing the same cryptogenic proof test that killed the previous two Starship prototypes. The test involves filling the vehicle's fuel tanks to capacity with cooled gasses. Elon Musk has stated that these failures are expected during the tests and that they provide vital information to use in the designs of future prototypes. The next prototype has already begun construction at Boca Chica.
