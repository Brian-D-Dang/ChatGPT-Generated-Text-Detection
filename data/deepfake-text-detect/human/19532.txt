When people talk about Islamic extremism, the first thing they like to bring up is that, "All religions have dangerous extremists, and it's not fair to pick on just Islam." Well first of all, that's not true. For example in Jainism, the more extreme you become the less violent you are. The most extreme members put clothes over their mouths in fear of accidentally inhaling in insects. Secondly, while it's true that all the large religions have violent extremists, it seems that Islam has a lot more of them. Why should religion be exempt from individual scrutiny? Religion is like sports; there's football, tennis, hockey, etc. Not every sport is the same just like not ever religion is the same - and just like sports some are more dangerous than others. Every week there are multiple suicide bombings in places like Iraq, Yemen, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Somalia, Nigeria, etc. Hundreds of people die every week at the hands of Islamic extremism. How can that compare to the one abortion doctor that gets killed by the Catholic extremist every 5 years or even the Westboro Baptist Church? Say what you want about the hateful things that groups spews, at least they don't kill people. tl;dr Most religions have dangerous extremists, but Islam seems to have the majority of them
