If you do not exist as a living being, you cannot feel suffering. Granted, you cannot feel pleasure, either, but is pleasure better than non-existence? If you exist, you feel suffering. But if you don't exist, you feel neither suffering nor pleasure, thus making it better. Why do we continue to procreate if life is not as good as non-life. We should stop all advancements in technology and science and focus on ending the torture of everyone, which we call life. Life sucks, and people don't realize this because, as a society, we think that death is bad, that life is preferable to non-life, when in reality we would all be better off it none of us had ever existed in the first place. Non-existence trumps existence. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
