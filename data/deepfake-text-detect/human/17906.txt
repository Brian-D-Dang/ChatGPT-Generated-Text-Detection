As the Internet contributes more and more to the spreading of knowledge globally, I believe that with time borders and recognition of nationality will be a thing of the past. As people grow up with the Internet their influences doesn't come from one single culture anymore, hence their allegiance to a specific geographically bound culture will weaken. The same mechanisms will destroy the political and economical power structures of today as people no longer rely on authority for information and knowledge. Countries will stop existing and politicians and authorities will no longer be needed because the world will be a self-regulatory system based on knowledge. Knowledge is control. If everyone has access to the same knowledge no one can be in control. The Internet finally makes anarchy viable. Please, change my view.
