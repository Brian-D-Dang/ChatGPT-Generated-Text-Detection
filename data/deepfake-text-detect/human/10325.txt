I spend my summer as a representative of the college I attend and interact regularly with kids between the ages of 10 and 18. In these interactions, I have noticed that - regardless of age and gender, these kids are often unable to write in cursive and sometimes even their print Handwriting is hardly legible. Now, I realize that we live in the digital age and typing is king (I think touch typing should also be taught), but I believe that learning handwriting from an early age (and throughout even high school) has several benefits including... 1) Improved sense of symmetry and order 2) Improved appreciation for art of different time periods 3) Largermore diverse vocabulary 4) Prepares users for the business world where signatures and other handwritten items are still fairly common Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I really think good Handwriting is useful even in the digital age.
