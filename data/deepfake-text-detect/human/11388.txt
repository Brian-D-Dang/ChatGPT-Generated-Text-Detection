It's a big day for billionaires with rockets folks! Jeff Bezos' rocket company Blue Origin is set to launch their New Shepard 10 rocket at 9:30 AM EST (3 hours and 30 minutes after you receive this email). Blue Origin says that they may begin to sell tickets for flights on their New Shepard rockets very soon. Jeff Bezos says "I'm hopeful it will happen in 2019. I was hopeful it would happen in 2018. I keep telling the team that it's not a race. I want this to be the safest space vehicle in history."
