I tried hard. Watched all three original seasons. It seems so hurried as if all the characters are on crack. If it were not a respected show and aired on History Channel, I think everyone would have blasted it. I could easily predict that there was money in the banana stand. The joke seemed so juvenile and unfunny that it could easily appear in a lame comic strip for children. Even when the show tried to be funny via quirky stuff like bobloblawlawblog or methodone, they were lost in the unnecessarily fast paced nature of the show. It just seems too rushed. How is a middle-aged woman with vertigo funny at all? Imagine if Chandler kept fainting all of a sudden and that itself were a running gag - it wouldn't work would it? In the same vein, I never found the hook funny at all. I am not saying I found it offensive to make fun of these disabilities, but they seem, like most of the humor in the show, a poor and lazy attempt. Hello, users of CMV!
