As a previous rater acknowledged, this is the only Club Car dealer in the area. This is unfortunate. Several things bugged me about this place. They overprice their new carts, then heavily discount them (kinda like cheap used car dealers of old.) But the real issue for me was the service department and dealership management. They did not listen and therefore prescribed the wrong fix at inflated pricing. When I asked questions in an attempt to get them to better understand the issue, I was told, maybe you should just fix it yourself. In addition the service department was very dirty and seemed disorganized. The experience led me to leave their facility, do some research, and actually fix it myself. Their quote was 2000, my cost ended up at 750. The combination of incompetence and arrogance at this place must come from their near monopoly in Phoenix for Club Car. I would push my car off a cliff and buy an EZGO before I would ever do business with them.
