OK, here is what I see what I look at the entire mainstream media, leaving aside any and all political bias. TV news isn't about journalism anymore, whoever is doing it. It's about infotainment. All American news channels are horrible. They pander to an audience and the only question is how much they pander. Some foreign networks are OK, but others are going the same route or were always just an arm of their country's propaganda machine. The standards at newspapers suck donkey balls. Does the New York Times even care about how they have a new "said reporter didn't even go there and do that" scandal every six months? It's a dying medium that has chosen to help itself commit suicide with incompetency, and nothing is really taking its place. And magazines are even worse. The quality of my magazine articles has slid terribly over the last 20 years. BOOKS. It seems like every book I pick up these days, even the big legacy publisher stuff, is sprinkled with proofing errors. Where I used to find one typo in 300 pages, I now find like one per 25 pages. I constantly find factual errors in my non-fiction books as well, as if fact-checked were left up to the author. The mainstream media is a bloated, stinking half-dead carcass floating on a river of raw sewage. Convince me there is hope for the future.
