I've always been a massive fan of the steam system and was really excited when xbox announced they'd do it. Now I do think they could of worked on their offline play a little better but it's 2013 and the dvd drive HAS to go. Dvds are outdated and create complications and limitations with developing a game. They're slow to process and hold barely any space compared to a hddsdd. Why us everyone so obsessed with cddvds? People do need to remember when purchasing a game you aren't buying the game, you are buying a license to play the game and the developer can add whatever terms they want to it. EDIT: To avoid confusing, by DRM, i mean the system where you purchase a game, it's downloaded and locked to a single account.
