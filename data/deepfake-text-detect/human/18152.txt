I read this [article] and I think it makes some good points. People seem to be gathering a smaller attention span and news seems to be following demand - giving snippets of information rather than looking and finding the meaning of text for themselves. because of this our understanding of things slowly becomes more cut and dry - there is less ambiguity left over for contemplation over a book or piece of writing. google actually benefits from us not gathering complete information. because we tend to gather smaller snippets of information as opposed to spending long periods of time reading and thinking over a single piece. With this in mind it is in google's best interest to have us select more superficial and easy to skim articles so that we keep bouncing from link to link so that they have the most exposure for their ads. Those are just the ones that are coming to me now. If any others occur to me I'll let you know.
