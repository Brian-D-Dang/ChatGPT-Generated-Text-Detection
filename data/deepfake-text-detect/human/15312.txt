maybe I'm being too harsh, but I barely got a greeting here. the staffer was too busy talking to a friend who had stopped by about her childcare plans for the week. as the staffer weighed my package and completed the shipping information she continued to engage her friend in conversation and ignore me. only when it was time to ask how quickly I wanted the package to arrive did she talk to me. I guess if my package arrives at the destination they've done their job, but I don't think they did it very well. I'll find another shipper next time I need to mail something.
