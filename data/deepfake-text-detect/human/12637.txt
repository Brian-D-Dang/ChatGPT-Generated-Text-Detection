My C.O. was a man named Kurtz. Brilliant man..... Insane man. Fancied himself God. After a while in the service, it could screw up your head. On this small spit of land out in the middle of nowhere, the intricate processes of sanity tended to break down rather quickly. "This, my boys, is the promised land. Now, I'm sure you all heard the rumors.... The tensions between the Reds and our boys in uniform.... Well, I'm afraid that we won't be returning to the states anytime soon. Fact of the matter is that there isn't much of the states to return to. "Kurtz spoke, but we couldn't believe it. "That's bullshit, man! That's not true, goddamn it!" Morales spoke up. He was too high strung for war, too high strung for most things. Under these circumstances, I couldn't blame him. He had a kid at home. Born of out wedlock, but he loved his son. Me, I just felt numb inside. I never had much of a family. Parents died when I was a kid, joined the service to avoid starvation or a slow death from alcoholism like a lot of my peers. I figured it would be easier to die quick in battle than to die slow in the civilian world. Only, it didn't turn out that way. There weren't any combatants left. There wasn't any flag left to fight for. We were absent without leave from a military that didn't even exist. "Calm down. It'll be okay." "Shut the fuck up, Jackson. It's not okay, and it ain't going to be, ever again."
