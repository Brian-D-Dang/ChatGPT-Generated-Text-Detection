You probably get this a lot, but I was thinking about it in the shower today. Yes, mac computers themselves are overpriced for the hardware, but what about software? If I have a Razerblade, I would want that to be bootcamped OSX for daily and windows for gaming. I find OSX to be an improvement over windows, and to be fair, I've bootcamped my mac, I have plenty of experience with windows. As a computer science student, I find my work is a lot easier on a mac. I have multiple desktops that I can switch between with a swipe of my trackpad, I have a UNIX coding environment thanks to Terminal, I have a free notepad editor thanks to Textwrangler (I recognize windows has notepad) I like the fact due to the low market share, viruses for macs aren't that common, and (This is one for apple) I like my 3 year warranty. The only drawback I can think of is that there aren't many games for OSX, but macs come with bootcamp, which doesn't void the warranty thankfully, so I can install windows quite easily. I like having the app store. I like having messages integrated with my iPhone. I guess in short: good for coding in unix languages like cc App store Multiple desktops Not a lot of viruses - (drawback) not a lot of games available.
