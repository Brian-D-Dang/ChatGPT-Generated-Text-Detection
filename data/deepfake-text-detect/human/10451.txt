The 90's saw us getting away from the big, bright colors of the 80's. Think of the old-fashioned kitchens and living rooms previous (avacado-colored refrigerators, etc). The 90's went for a much cleaner, interchangeable look. A beige sofa can take on a completely different look depending on the pillows, throw blanket, etc. Jewel tones became popular in contrast to the bright primary colors that had been popular before. Whatever neutral color became commonplace had to work with what was already there as well. Beige works well with wood grains and earth tones as opposed to, say, gray (browns and grays being very difficult colors to combine correctly). Also, the 80's were very much associated with "excess." The 90's tried to introduce "simplicity." It may look very "blah" from today's standpoint, but at the time it was quite refreshing to pare things down and simplify.
