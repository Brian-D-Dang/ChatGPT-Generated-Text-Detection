[ From Wikipedia] : Descriptive moral relativism holds only that some people do in fact disagree about what is moral; meta-ethical moral relativism holds that in such disagreements, nobody is objectively right or wrong; and normative moral relativism holds that because nobody is right or wrong, we ought to tolerate the behavior of others even when we disagree about the morality of it. I see this view brought up as a very common groundwork in social science and humanities classes (except for philosophy). It's often used to justify allowing other cultures to do different things and the main argument against cultural imperialism. In this way, it's the groundwork for cultural relativism. But even domestically, this sort of thinking denies us the groundwork to argue why we have a right to punish murderers and rapists. Since I see this to be the case, I oppose moral relativism fiercely and hope its influence in our universities is halted soon. Change my view.
