Why do you think that the circulation is improved? It isn't that I know of. Also more than likely the drawbacks would outweigh the positives. Thos pulseless hearts dont last forever, I am pretty sure they have to be hooked up to a battery supply, they dont scale with oxygen demand (Ie if you were to start running they wouldnt speed up) etc.," "No. Your heart beats precisely according to the rest of your body. The chemical checks for heartbeat to pulse is maintained through many different interwoven systems. Think if you get into a panic and there is a lot more o2 needed. Well if there's a lot of o2 we need to tone it down so we slow the heart to get more carbonic acid in and try to balance o2 and co2. That's an easy example, but we also have capillary beds and blood plasma that is synchronized to the heartbeat. The capillaries can rewire when needed, and set the heart to whatever the bed is going to need because those capillary beds effect the amount of pressure going into and out of them. Also the capilarry beds need to balance out the blood pressure to keep the osmotic properties where they need to be. This can be something like the adrenyl gland needs to pump a tiny bit of adrenyline to get a different hormone reacted, or there needs to be more blood plasma around a lymph node to increase production of lymphocytes. Its very very complicated and the heart and the pressure it keeps the circulation at is maintained integrally through different parts of the body.
