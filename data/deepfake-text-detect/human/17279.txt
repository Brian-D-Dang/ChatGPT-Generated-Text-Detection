We now know that verbal abuse causes damage to the brain. Since verbal abuse causes damage to the brain, how is this any different than a punch causing a bruise or cut? Both are physical damage, the fact that one is not visible is irrelevant. It follows from this equivalency that if someone is verbally abusing you, it is ok to retaliate physically, even if they have not touched you in a classically physical way (punch, push, kick, act).
