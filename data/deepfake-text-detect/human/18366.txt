I posted [this pic in rpics] . In the post title, I gave context for the picture. I also posted the pic in three relevant subreddits that I thought would enjoy the content. I am now aware that what I did is classically referred to as 'Karma-whoring'. However, when the actions were undertaken, all I was trying to do was share what had happened in my life with a society of like-minded people in an online community. I had no intention of attempting to accrue undue karma. I subsequently deleted the x-posts, and, only after a discussion with the top-comment holder in the original post via pm, did I not delete the original, as we determined it would most likely eliminate their comment karma. This turn of events kept me away from reddit for some time, and still, to this day, leaves a dark spot in my good cheer. I have come to love reddit for all that it can do and do well. However: I believe that the community's desire to self-police has turned into a situation where, much like 'racist' in public sphere, or 'PED user' in sports, 'Karma-whore' is a label that get thrown around with impunity, and individual people are hurt more by the possibility of false accusation than the community could possibly be hurt by the actual action. Change my view.
