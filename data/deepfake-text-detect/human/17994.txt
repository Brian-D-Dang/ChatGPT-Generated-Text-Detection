It makes no appreciable, tangible difference to be well-informed about international news. People who like to discuss global issues prefer to think themselves well-informed but it's meaningless chatter that isn't really that different from discussing sports or reality show, especially in terms of impact on one's personal life. I don't even really see how one can claim it makes someone a "better person" to be aware or conscious or what have you. Even for voting, how much do foreign affairs really factor into American elections? Other than places we're directly involved, why should anyone care about what's going on in say, Somalia or the Republic of Congo?
