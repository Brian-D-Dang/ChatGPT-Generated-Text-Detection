Harvard has created a Harvard Ambulatory Microrobot the size of a penny that can run at speeds of 13.9 body lengths per second. HAMR-JR was built as a test to see whether the origami-style manufacturing process used to make it could produce robots of all different scales. The design of HAMR-JR is exactly the same as the one used in its predecessor, HAMR, but scaled down. Photos and videos of the robots are available in the article.
