Ok, first off i am a Junior in High school and i always wanted to be in the electrical field. I was always interested in wiring and circuits, and just wanting to fix things. Any electrical degree that is offered by universities is always "engineering." And frankly, i don't want to be an engineer. I suck at all types of math and numbers. Not just math, but i've never been a "good" student. I would almost always end the marking period failing 1 or 2 classes. Although i would rarely obtain merit and honor roll. And engineering degrees take A LOT of dedication, smarts, and money. I just think a regular electrician job is for me. This may sound weird, but i actually want to do labor. I want to be moving, using my hands, and actually working. The electric fields mostly contain technicians, repairmen, installation, and maintenance. And i don't think colleges or universities prepare you for these types of jobs. i may be misled , but if i actually wanted to wirefix electric in houses and industry, my best choice would be a trade school or a vocational school. They offer classes that teach you about certain trades until you graduate, and then you act as an apprentice to a experienced one until your ready. My parents want me to attend college, but i just think it might not be for everyone (me). I don't like the degrees they offer and maybe trade school could save me from student debt, and i could enjoy my job a lot better. Thanks for reading.
