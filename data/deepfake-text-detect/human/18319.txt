Disclaimer first: I believe global warming could be a very real threat, and obviously should be prepared against. Having said that: Since Thatcher's era, our industry has dwindled to the point where we are now effectively a consumer society. Areas of Britain, the north in particular, have been gutted, and unemployment in these areas are a grim read. All because the industry moved away. With fracking, we have a genuine opportunity to bring a form of industry back to the UK, with no provisos due to the fact that it is a natural substance rooted in the ground. No manufacture costs that hold businesses back from coming to the UK- if you want the materials, you have to come into the country to extract it, you have to employ people to do it. When people also hear the word 'fossil fuel', it becomes a buzz-word for bad. And sometimes rightly so. However, the extraction of gas is a lesser evil than oil- its slightly cleaner for starters. And, with extraction coming to the UK, we may be able to switch to a less damaging product in a host of areas, such as in our cars. What keeps us back at the moment is the sheer cost of importing gas from areas like Russia, and with a domestic product available, so too will cheaper energy. Of course it's not the ideal scenario, but right now we have no other alternatives. 'Green' energy carry with it a huge carbon debt made from the production stage that relies on oil, and are proving to be inefficient and intrusive towards people's lives. We need to slow down implementation of green sources and plough that money into research and development, but also reduce dependency on oil, something that, for the mean time, gas can provide.
