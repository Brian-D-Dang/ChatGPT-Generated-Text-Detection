I believe that birth control, while generally a quality of life improvement, is not a "basic human right" as many people would argue. The largest argument I have heard is one of women's rights, in that women should have control over their own reproductive choices, and birth control is a means to that end. I believe that the basic human right associated with reproductive choice is the right to refuse sexual intercourse. People are entirely free to not have children, and that freedom should be protected as a human right. However, I don't believe that people are entitled to having sex without consequences. There are many things in this world that are quality of life improvements, but that doesn't necesitate that they be provided free of charge and considered fundamental to decent human existance. As an aside, I understand that birth control pills are often prescribed as a treatment for certain conditions. I would consider that as medicine and a basic human right. I am speaking only to birth control to be used for the purpose of recreational sex. So there you have it, please CMV. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
