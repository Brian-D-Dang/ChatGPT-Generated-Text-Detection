"It has to look nice- but not too expensive." I tell the middle aged man in the orange apron. "Right, but what kind are you looking for?" He asks again, obviously not understanding my limited parameters. "It really doesn't matter. It just needs to look nice and" "Not be too expensive. Right, right, I get it. So what do you want to use it for? This really changes what variety you want and the price range." The man tries to explain again. He must have had a landscaping company before he worked here. There is no other explanation as to why he knows or cares so much. My face sinks into my palm. Sure, it isn't everyday someone is so desperate to buy some plants, but dammit how does this man not understand urgency! "It will make my wish come true, now PLEASE! SELL ME A SHRUBBERY!"
