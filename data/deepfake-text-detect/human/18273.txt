I feel some higher education courses at universities are too vocational at the moment. I think they should be more about studying the subject and gaining a deeper understanding of the subject rather than simply job training. I study computer science at university and I have to do two courses I disagree with. One in design and one in business and law. Although these courses may be useful when looking for a job after graduating, that is not what I am looking for in a degree. I go to university as a scholar and therefore want to study the subject not vocational skills. Change my view.
