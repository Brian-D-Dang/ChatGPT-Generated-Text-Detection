This paper proposes a robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL) -based multi-access point (AP) coordination method that is robust even against unexpected decentralized operations of uncoordinated APs. Multi-AP coordination is a promising technique towards IEEE 802.11be, and there are studies that use RL for multi-AP coordination. Indeed, a simple RL-based multi-AP coordination method diminishes the collision probability among the APs; therefore, the method is a promising approach to improve time-resource efficiency. However, this method is vulnerable to frame transmissions of uncoordinated APs that are less aware of frame transmissions of other coordinated APs. To help the central agent experience even such unexpected frame transmissions, in addition to the central agent, the proposed method also competitively trains an adversarial AP that disturbs coordinated APs by causing frame collisions intensively. Besides, we propose to exploit a history of frame losses of a coordinated AP to promote reasonable competition between the central agent and adversarial AP. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method can avoid uncoordinated interference and thereby improve the minimum sum of the throughputs in the system compared to not considering the uncoordinated AP.
