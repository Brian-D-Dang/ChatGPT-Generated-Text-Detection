I've followed the Hobby Lobby case for awhile and the resent ruling basically allows for only Christian religious beliefs to be considered valid. The main reason I bring this argument is how in the explanation of the ruling the justices noted that this ruling does not cover instances of religious refusal for vaccinations or blood transfusions, rather just on birth control pills that whose prime purposes are (to hobby lobby) abortion aids. The problem lies in that one of the main arguments for this case was hobby lobby was not demanding their employees not take BC just that they should not be financially responsible. I see no difference between this and a scenario where a business owned by a jehovah's witness who while allowing their employees to have blood transfusions would not wish to be financially liable as it violates their religious beliefs. The only difference between the two scenarios is that hobby lobby dealt with Christian values. Therefore my conclusion is that the supreme court just issued a ruling allowing for government sponsored religious discrimination. CMV Please! Edit: hey everyone I realize my CMV I'd a little murky what I am arguing really is "mainstream" Christian beliefs as for in my example I did not realize that jehovah's witnesses were christian.
