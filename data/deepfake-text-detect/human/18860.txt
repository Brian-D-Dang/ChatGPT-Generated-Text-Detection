First off let me say that I do not think that when it comes to a job application, choosing a white person with worse qualifications over a black person is acceptable. I just think that being racist is a part of free speech . No matter how ignorant or offensive something is, it should not be illegal to share your own opinion or just throw hate at a certain group of people.
