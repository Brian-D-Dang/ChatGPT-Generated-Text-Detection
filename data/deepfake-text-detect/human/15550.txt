2 young ladies behind the counter could not have cared less to be serving customers. 5 of us in line received the same unenthusiastic, practically scowling and somewhat confusing service. Mac and cheese heavily promoted, out of Mac and cheese. Out of soup. Out of raspberry smoothie mix. Out of blue cheese for my salad.... Asked for feta instead, ultimately received no cheese. Nor a fork. Nor a napkin. Prices are reasonable, that's about all I can say. I'm sure the other 4 customers are also wishing they'd gone to Starbucks. Or S'barro. Or just grabbed a 6 mini bag of Chex Mix and a 4 water at the sundries shop. Not your best location, Paradise. PS: if I ask for no tomato or onion on my sandwich, pretty sure I don't want them on my side salad either. PPS: oh look! No cranberry on my cranberry turkey sandwich! The hits keep coming...
