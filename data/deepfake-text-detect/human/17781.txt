Added for clarity: the [lump of labor fallacy] doesn't take into account intelligent machines. Added for more clarity: 'Intelligent' like Google self-driving cars and automated stock trading programs, not 'Intelligent' like we've cracked hard AI. Final clarification of assumptions: 1. Previous technological innovations have decreased the need for, and reduced the cost of, physical human labor. 2. New jobs emerged in the past because of increased demand for intellectual labor. 3. Current technological developments are competing with humans in the intellectual labor job market. 4. Technology gets both smarter and cheaper over time. Humans do not. 5. Technology will, eventually, be able to outcompete humans in almost all current jobs on a cost basis. 6. New jobs will be created in the future, but the number of them where technology cannot outcompete humans will be tiny. Thus, massive unemployment.
