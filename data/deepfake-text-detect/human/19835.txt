As I said, I myself am an atheist. I completely accept homosexuality, and find nothing wrong with it. People who are in love are in love. I don't believe it is a choice, because I don't know anybody in their right mind who would voluntarily choose a more difficult, less socially accepted life. That being said, I support the church's decision to not allow same-sex marriage. I believe that the institution of marriage is a religious institution, and I know that the bible deems homosexuality as "an abomination." Because of that, if the church doesn't want to allow same sex marriage, I don't see a problem with that because the book that they follow, and that the religion is based around, forbids it. I believe that same sex relationships should have the same legal benefits as heterosexual relationships, in the eyes of the government and what not, I just don't believe the church should have to break the rules of their religion because people, including myself, find it socially wrong and discriminatory. I would love to hear what reddit has to say about this topic, because I am so torn on this issue. EDIT: Thank you guys so much for your responses. This was my first time posting to this subreddit, and I wasn't really sure what kind of responses I would get. That being said, I would like to apologize for my ignorance on the topic of holy marriage and the legality behind the institution of marriage. I should have looked a little further into the entire issue before composing my stance. I really appreciate the input you guys have all given me, and it makes me feel a lot better knowing that I am a bit more educated on the subject.
