This was our second time dining here. It was just as good as the first. First, the wait staff remembered us from our previous visit over a year ago. Impressive. I'm typically a steakpotato type guy, but place is really great. I don't know what half the ingredients are in a entree, but they all taste great. Every thing we had was prepared well, tasty, and a good sized portion. The staff is very attentive, and the place has a great vibe. We don't get down to old town much, but will make this the place for dinner when we do. We prefer the chefs table (Bar) over a table, seems way more fun and hip.
