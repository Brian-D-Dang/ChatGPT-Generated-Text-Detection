A report by the World Wildlife Foundation involving 59 scientists has found that humanity has wiped out 60 of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles since 1970. Other studies have shown that humans have wiped out about 83 of mammals, and even if we stop now the natural world will take 5 to 7 million years to recover. Many scientists believe that this is the sixth mass extinction, the first to be caused by a single species. The biggest causes of death are the destruction of natural habitats, followed by killing for food (300 mammals are being eaten into extinction). Mike Barrett, executive director of science and conservation at WWF, says "We need a new global deal for nature and people and we have this narrow window of less than two years to get it. This really is the last chance. We have to get it right this time."
