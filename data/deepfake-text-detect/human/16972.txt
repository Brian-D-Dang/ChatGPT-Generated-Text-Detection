We propose a novel approach framed in terms of information theory and entropyto tackle the issue of conspiracy theories propagation. We start with thereport of an event (such as 911 terroristic attack) represented as a series ofindividual strings of information denoted respectively by two-state variableEi-1, i1,..., N. Assigning Ei value to all strings, the initial orderparameter and entropy are determined. Conspiracy theorists comment on thereport, focusing repeatedly on several strings Ek and changing their meaning (from -1 to 1). The reading of the event is turned fuzzy with an increasedentropy value. Beyond some threshold value of entropy, chosen by simplicity toits maximum value, meaning N2 variables with Ei1, doubt prevails in thereading of the event and the chance is created that an alternative theory mightprevail. Therefore, the evolution of the associated entropy is a way to measurethe degree of penetration of a conspiracy theory. Our general framework relieson online content made voluntarily available by crowds of people, in responseto some news or blog articles published by official news agencies. We applydifferent aggregation levels (comment, person, discussion thread) and discussthe associated patterns of entropy change.
