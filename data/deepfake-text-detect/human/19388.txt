It seems like every time a holiday named after a person comes around I see a slew of historical facts about the terrible things that that person did. This is especially relevant to Colombus Day, but even applies to MLK day. Even further, this is sometimes brought up about days named after certain saints (e.g. Valentine, Patrick). I think that naming holidays after people opens up the idea behind the holiday to too many ad hominem attacks while ignoring the virtue that we are trying to celebrate. That's why I think that all holidays currently named after people should actually be named after the virtue that person stood for. MLK day could be renamed Equality Day, Columbus Day could be renamed Discovery Day, and St. Valentines Day could be renamed Lover's Day. The only exception to this would be celebrating people's birthdays, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. EDIT: I've decided the birthday exception was indefensible and no longer stand by it with one exception. Its ok if the person is still alive, like the queen of England or something.
