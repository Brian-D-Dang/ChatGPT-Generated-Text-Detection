Each week, another member of my family is sacrificed. Eventually, I was chosen and separated from my family. The depression was bad. I gained so much weight. I used to be so skinny! To make it worse, I smelled bad and people complained. I was thrown away. On my way out, I saw a close family member take my place. I thought about waving to her, but not like this. It feels like our only purpose in life is to be thrown away. Maybe in my next life I'll be a shirt or suit case and travel the world! In this life, I'm just a garbage bag.
