Striking is an important negotiation tactic, but it's balanced by the risk that a company owner will remove their capital and reinvest somewhere else, so the strikers will lose their jobs. Or that their demands will make the company uncompetitive and it'll go out of business, again leading to no jobs. Thus the demands of strikers in a private business are tempered by the need to account for what's best for the business as well as its workers. In the government sector this balancing force does not exist. The state does not typically run organizations to make short term profit; they're run for the benefit of its citizens. It rarely has direct competitors, and often cannot exit the market because it provides key services. Thus, striking government sector workers (who already have relatively better job security) are not taking on much risk and have little reason to produce reasonable demands. While I strongly believe in the right to strike for other workers, and feel that everybody deserves reasonable pay working conditions, government employees should not have the right to strike. This includes police officers, firefighters, soldiers, teachers, transport workers et cetera. They need to negotiate using other methods more appropriate to the state sector. I feel this is sensible but there is often widespread public support for government sector strikers, so I'd like to hear some opposing arguments and get a feel for where there might be situations where my approach is inapplicable.
