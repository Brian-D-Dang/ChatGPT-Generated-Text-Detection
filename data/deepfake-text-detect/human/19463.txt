We live in the information age, so those with physical disabilities are still very easily able to assist in most areas of the workforce. Those with what I consider "minor" mental disabilities (example- autism (though there are exceptions I would assume Are still useful in the labor force. The ones that I am talking about are those that are essentially adult babies, they must be watched and assisted by other humans almost constantly, and perhaps they are even restricted to using a form of mobility assistance. They would most certainly be unable to support themselves. So why do we help them? Forgive me for being somewhat unsympathetic, but isn't that what natural selection is for?
