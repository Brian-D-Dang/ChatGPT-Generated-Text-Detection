So, recently, I've been stressing over basic High School math. Algebra to be exact. To be on-the-dot precise, inequalities and absolute variation... But, what I'm worried about is not this lesson specifically. I want to fall in love with math, so much so that I am willing to teach it to myself, and pay attention in class. That's usually where the issue is, I suppose. As a person who has taken a liking to English, Science, and Preforming, I tend to daydream in class, causing a dent in my grade no amount of internet tutorials can make up for. So, my goal today is to make math interesting. For it to captivate me, and so that in the end, I can finally reclaim my spot among my fellow geeks as an algebra wizard. TL;DR: Math sucks. I don't want it to. Help.
