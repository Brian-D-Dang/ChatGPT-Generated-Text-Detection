Wow... I smell a bankruptcy happening here soon. This place is amazingly outdated. I mean REALLY old school. Dirty, dingy, and just plain silly. The attractions at the top are more for gimick sake, than any real excitement. I did enjoy the view from the observation deck though. I mean it was cool and you didn't have to splurge for a helicopter tour. Other than that, this place is easily skippable.
