A great example of this was the badminton scandal at the 2012 olympics: [LINK] I think that the tournament organizers should be able to properly seed the players using data obtained during the tournament AND before the tournament. For example, in Women's Hockey, where Team USA and Team Canada are dominant, and have met in all but one gold-medal-game, it is always made sure that they won't meet in an elimination game before the final itself (assuming they perform their best and each win all their games). So they never need to throw matches to avoid facing each other before the finals. Also, it should be acceptable to throw a match to avoid eliminating or playing a teammate from your country. To avoid this necessity, there should be rules in the seeding procedure to make matches between country-mates occur as late in competition as possible. (e.g. if the normal seeding dictated semifinal matchups of China vs. China and Japan vs. India, the normal seeding would be overridden and instead you would see China vs. Japan and China vs. India) EDIT: I'm going to simplify my opinion to say the following: even if seeding procedures are done "properly," the competitors should be allowed to lose if they perceive a future advantage to losing. If officials don't want players to have to deliberately lose, they should allow players to forfeit individual matches before the match begins.
