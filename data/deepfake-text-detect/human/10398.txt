The likes of ratheism argue that most of the world's problems come from religion, and that a post-religion world would be miles better. As humans, we inherently drive ourselves into groups based on similarities. Sometimes, these groups bunch up against each other. Eventually, the groups will want to expand over the same area. Each group thinks that they are the sole group worthy of that land, and that they must display this worthiness by stopping anyone that gets into their way. You could replace the word "group" with anything: religion, race, color, etc. Sure, religion's the largest group, but if religion were to disappear any day, there would still be sectarian fighting. You'd hear news about conflicts between the "Arab Nationalist Front" and the "Pashtun Defense Brigade" instead of ISIS that could be just as violent as religious conflict. TL;DR: If humans weren't killing each other over religion, they'd be killing each other over ethnicity or race.
