As humans we were always concerned about what was going on around us. We tried to search for causes of actions and consequences of other actions. We tried to predict and reverse engineer everything we could. Today we assume that most things follow rules. Atoms form bonds in a certain way and apparently do not do anything at random. As we know the human body is made up out of a huge load of molecules, made out of even more Atoms, all behaving in a known and predictable way. All these Atoms interact with each other in more complicated ways since we have to calculate all there single behaviours together. The whole body is just a huge chain-reactions of atoms forming and leaving bonds. Eventhough you are able to react to things in a complicated way it still is nothing else than a huge chain-reaction. Even your brain, the center of the "You" is still only a bunch of atoms doing what ever atoms do. This means that eventhough we aren't at the moment able to percisely predict the whole behaviour of a human to every possible impulse we in theory were able to do this, given enough calculationpower and information. This is true for every human being, so every human is just like a very inteligent machine, doing what nature tells him to do. And because of that you aswell as me and anyone else only follows a pattern, each his own, individual way, interacting with all the other patterns but still as ruled by nature as the most fundamental parts of our existence, also called "fate" by some esoteric humans.
