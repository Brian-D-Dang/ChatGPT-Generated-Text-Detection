I don't understand why [these] [kinds] [of] [pictures] are needed to tell a one or two sentence story. I feel like most of the time, a text post would be more interesting and actually give details to the story. Currently on the front page: [To the guy who plans on letting his girlfriend to continue thinking he is cheating on her, just so he can surprise her with a puppy] What does that accomplish that simply posting a comment on the original thread would not? Aside from the general idea of that sub, there are a few of its more popular memes that I don't get. The 'Am I the only one around here' meme. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] By the nature of how reddit works, those posting this meme clearly do not think that they are truly the only one that feels that way. The same is true for the 'unpopular opinion puffin' thing. The 'Good Girl Gina' meme. [This SRS post goes into more detail about this meme than I care to] The 'Actual Advice Mallard' meme. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] These are admittedly a little worse than the typical ones, but I feel in general that the advice given on these pictures is either extremely obvious or impractical. Lastly, a large portion of the posts I see there are attempts at bragging through obviously fake stories. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
