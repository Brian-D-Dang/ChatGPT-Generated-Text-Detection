I know people will still come and eat here even after reading all the horrid reviews... But seriously though, this place has a bunch of dumbasses working here. I called around 10:35 at night no one picked up.... I called back in ten minutes.... No answer.... By the way, all this is happening Ehile driving there...I end getting there and see all the workers outside smoking... No one was inside at all! The phone was ringing off the hook. Customers were waiting for their pizza also. This will be the last time I ever come here ever. Dear Management if you are reading this, I advise you to fix this piece of shit location. I am currently typing this as I wait for my pizza in this crap establishment, my pizza better be good.
