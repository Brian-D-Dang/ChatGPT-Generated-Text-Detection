I have one child in college now, and three more who will be heading off in the next few years. I believe that there is nothing wrong with setting reasonable conditions upon which I will pay for their education. I think it's perfectly reasonable to set conditions on locations and majors if they're expecting me to pay for it. My general rule is: they can major in anything they like if they go to either UF or FSU (we're in Florida obviously). If however they want to go to Miami, or (as with my daughter) Yale, or any other top school, then I have final approval on their major; I'm not going to pay 200k - 300k for a Liberal Arts, or Art History degree. College is about education, yes, but it's every bit as much an investment in the future, and paying top dollar for a degree with limited earning potential is, quite simply, a bad investment. And before the "but the quality of the education is better" arguments start, I'm not debating that; of course an Art History education (for example) from Yale will be of higher quality than one from University of Florida, but at the end of the day, even the highest quality Art History degree is still just an Art History degree. If you want to change my view, convince me that the value of the degree should be irrelevant when it comes to the cost of the education. Edit: To be clear, I'm willing to pay the cost of four years at a state school towards any school if they decide to go it on their own. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
