Whoever said the portions here are small must eat some serious food! Yes, the portion sizes are small, but c'mon, it's an all-you-can-eat buffet! Have 10 rounds if you're that hungry. I thought the sizes were just perfect. Served in their own cute, little platters, everything they offered was so rich and savory! Here's a sampling of what I tried: -Risotto with mushroom medley -Collared greens and ham hocks -Prime rib (and they can cook it a little more if it's too raw for you -Custom mac and cheese bar. I had crab, mushroom, bacon and sun dried tomatoes on mine. -Bone marrow spread for your bread...heh, not my taste, but worth trying. -Truffle ravioli -Grilled salmon -Grilled shrimp on risotto -An assortment of dessert options (i.e. fried beignet with coffee sauce) Verdict? Wicked SpoonWicked Good! One of the best Vegas buffets I've tried, ever. There are lots of buffets worth checking out in Vegas and this one should definitely be one of them! Plus, it's an excuse to come visit one of the newer hotels on the strip, and probably one of the last ones to be built for awhile. So purrty!
