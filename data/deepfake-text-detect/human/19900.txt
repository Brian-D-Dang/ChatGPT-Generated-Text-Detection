I live in Utah, and because of that, I am surrounded by Christians. In my experience these people respect individual decisions and beliefs to a far greater extent that the posts I've seen in ratheism. I think there are similarities to religion and atheism that can be made, one of them being the desire to share knowledge that can improve the lives of others. But from there, I think that Christians are much more pleasant in their approach to sharing their views. Now these people can be pushy (Mormons are famous for it) but they are far less hostile and much more accepting of people who may share beliefs that are in-congruent of their own.
