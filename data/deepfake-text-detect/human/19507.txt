So, for example, lets say President A said "I will lower unemployment to below 6 by November of next year." If the President does this, then it is all fine and dandy. However, if he does not he should be impeached. The senate should then decide if he is worth of being removed from office. I think this would work because it would force the President A to state how he is going to get unemployment below 6, instead of just saying blatant lies. It would also add some transparency to the President and U.S. Government, instead of everything being "hush-hush." I agree, some things have got to be kept quiet but blatant lies should be punishable.
