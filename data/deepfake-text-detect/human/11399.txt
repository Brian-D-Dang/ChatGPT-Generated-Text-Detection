Researchers have created a smart textile that is flexible, breathable, durable, and functions as a display. It can be integrated with a fabric keyboard and power supply. The textile has been tested through 1,000 cycles of bending, stretching, and pressing, as well as 100 cycles of washing and drying. At 6 meters long and 25 centimeters wide, the textile can display a consistent image while lasting as long as traditional fabrics.
