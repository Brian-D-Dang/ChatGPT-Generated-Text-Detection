"So, your name is Esther?" "That's correct, Jamie." She nods, a glimmer dancing around the room. "My guardian angel." Jamie looks over to the wall where his prosthetic leg rests. "I don't believe you did a very good job." "If you're talking about Fallujah, then yes. I will take full responsibility for what happened there." Esther bows her head. "He was my spotter, and you couldn't save him?" Jamie's eye goes over to his ghillie suit. "You feel betrayed, and I understand that. But you should know that in death, Virgil was able to save seven lives." Esther answers. "He was an organ donor. So what?" Jamie answers, sitting up now. "I'm never going to meet the people who got his organs." "Yes you did. Aaliyah." Aaliyah The name sends shivers down his spine. She was a girl who had left Iraq to learn in the UK, and she had wanted to meet him before he went home. "What did she get from him?" "Corneas." "She..... she was looking at me with his eyes?" Jamie starts sobbing. "So why tell me this? Where are you going now?" "I've been reassigned to Aaliyah. My replacement will be coming to see you soon. But he is not going to be taking a humanoid form." "What's his name?" Jamie asks. "Lionel. You will know him when you see him." Esther fades from view, leaving Jamie to try to sleep. Two days later, Jamie walks into the animal shelter to meet with the trauma dog team. He's been putting this off too long, but he knows if he wants to get past his pain, he'll need a companion. He walks past the female collie, the male boxer and the male cocker spaniel. But then he sees the male beagle. The nametag reads "Lionel." "Hello there, Lionel. Something tells me we were meant for each other." The beagle reaches up, gently placing a paw in his hand. Jamie can't be sure, but he thinks the dog just winked at him.
