Hardcore gaming: your primary hobby, the thing you do most in your spare time. Games are simulations of real life. Hardcore gamers are people who have given up on real life and decided to rely on games in order to achieve the satisfaction that was once only available from real life situations. Hardcore gaming is a form of escapism for people who have kind of given up on achieving serious satisfaction in real life from friendships, romantic relationships or just generally being successful in your personal and professional life. I believe hardcore gaming is a lifestyle you settle for rather than something you choose, I believe every hardcore gamer has hopes and dreams that their gaming partially or completely stops them from achieving. It subtracts from hobbys and activities which can improve your skills and your life in general. Hardcore gamers are rarely interesting people, this isnt inherent, it's a product of the fact that all they do is work in an office and sit on the couch all weekend. Something that consumes your life and produces nothing of value for you other than a distraction from a life you have the power to change, cant be healthy for you physically or emotionally.
