The word is "osmosis." Osmosis refers to how water will move across a permeable membrane from an area of low salinity (inside the slug) to and area of high salinity (pure salt). So basically because science, the salt just sucks the moisture out of them. This doesn't happen to many other organisms (like you for instance) because their skin is not quite so permeable and water can't slow across it.
