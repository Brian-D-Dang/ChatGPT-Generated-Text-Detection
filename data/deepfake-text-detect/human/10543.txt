Sometimes they develop into their own capillary beds, but if the amputation is done properly, then the surgeon will try to attach the loose ends together. Cauterizing the stump may work, but also may send the person into shock, so it shouldn't be used on someone who is weak, and is not normally used for major amputations (such as limbs) and are more for gashes, cuts, bullet wounds and minor amputations (such as losing a finger)
