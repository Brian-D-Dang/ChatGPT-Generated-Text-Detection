Norway is building the world's first ship tunnel to help vessels navigate the Stadhavet Sea. The tunnel will cost around 2.8 billion Norwegian kroner and take between three to four years to build. Construction is due to begin in 2022. The tunnel will protect ships from the weather and tide. It could also enable a ferry service in the future. Building the tunnel will involve removing roughly three million cubic meters of rock.
