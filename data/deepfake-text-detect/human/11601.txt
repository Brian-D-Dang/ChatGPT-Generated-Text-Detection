The 61st International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) is the first IMO that has been held remotely and may also be the last time that artificial intelligence doesn't compete. Researchers view the IMO as an ideal proving ground for machines designed to think like humans. The problems don't require any advanced math, but they are extremely difficult. The most decorated IMO participants become legends in the mathematics community and some go on to become superlative research mathematicians. Solving IMO problems usually requires a flash of insight, which may not be possible on AI. Teaching an AI to compete in the IMO will be a challenge, as current software would probably completely fail at the task.
