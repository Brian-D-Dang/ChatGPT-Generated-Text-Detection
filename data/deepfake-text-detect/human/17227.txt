Two reason why I do not believe he is deserving. - Obama Syndrome. He's been given an award for saying good things, rather than doing actual good things. Where is the evidence of actual positive change that has been accomplished as a result of Francis? - He's the head of the Catholic Church, a group with a sordid history based on unproven superstitions that is continuing to repress basic human rights in many areas. Personally, I do not think anyone affiliated with such a religion should be given such a honor, and rather such rewards should be given to people from groups that are willing to embrace science and independent thought rather than reject it.
