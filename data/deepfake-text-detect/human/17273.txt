I've noticed a lot that people are easily offended when others use the word gay as an adjective, i.e. "That's gay." While I agree that there are probably better words that could be used in place of this, I don't think it is appropriate to be offended by its use. Obviously the person saying gay doesn't mean to insult anyone of that sexual orientation, it's just that the word has become more or less ingrained into our language, and sometimes it comes out subconsciously. Again, I'm not saying that 'gay' should be used in this manner, I just think that being outraged when you hear it is being over sensitive. CMV.
