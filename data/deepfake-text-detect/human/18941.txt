Whenever I play any console, I receive trophies for just playing some parts of the campaignstory mode. What's the purpose of it? I mean, I they are going to give me a prize, it should be for something special, not something I'm supposed to do (For example, I was playing Need For Speed: The run, and I was given a trophy for finishing the 5th stage). Trophies should be given only when someone does something unusual, or moderately hard (Such as completing an objective in a short time, killing enemies efficiently, etc.), as they are in real life. I know that sometimes trophies give you points that can be traded for special features or other minor advantages, but, Do we deserve them just for doing something that is required? The prize we get from playing story mode is fun, and the prize we should get for doing special gaming performances should be additional fun.
