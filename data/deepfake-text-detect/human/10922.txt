During Nixon's presidency a few guys from CREEP (the committee to re-elect the president) decided they wanted to break into the DNC's headquarters at the Watergate Hotel in DC. Their intent was to snoop around in the different papers and plant microphones so they could hear private Democratic conversarions. They successfully broke into the HQ. However the burglars were caught by hotel security and promptly arrested by the police. The burglars either confessed or were indicted. Whether Nixon himself had a hand in the whole break-in is a bit cloudy however most believe he didn't order a break-in at all, and CREEP acted alone. However Nixon shot himself in the foot because he decided to try to cover up the whole enchilada. Nixon was a very paranoid person to begin with. The break-in basically made him spiral into a state of severe distrust of anyone in the press or his own cabinet. Eventually Congress got through all the BS he tried throwing their way and found out he covered up the whole thing. It looks really bad on Nixon's part, so the House Judiciary Committee approved impeachment articles. Nixon resigned before he could be removed from office. Edit: spelling, words," "At the low point of the whole thing Nixon ordered the Attorney General to fire the special prosecutor assigned to investigate the case, and close the case. The Attorney General refused and was fired by Nixon. He then ordered the Deputy Attorney General to do the same. This person refused and was also fired. The 3rd person up ultimately completed the task. All of this occured in one night. If that's not abuse of Executive Power, I don't know what is.," "There were so many different aspects to it. There was the cover ups and the lies about what happened. They bugged people's offices and were spying on American citizens, similar to NSA in recent times. They used the FBI, CIA, and IRS to harass political figures. Also a general abuse of power by Nixon.
