"But think about the people who care about you." Ok, so now the persons only reason to live is to prevent others from getting sad? It kinda contradicts itself "you should live for my sake" yea..they totally care about the suicidal person.. "It can get better" Just like how you can win the lottery, doesn't mean you should keep on trying. Assess the situation, if meds and therapy hasn't helped then this is a BS argument. I think people are reflecting their perspective on life onto other people and assume they process the world the same as them and get the same enjoyment out of it when they actually don't. Also in many cases people are severely suicidal (not just thinking about it) because they don't have anyone who genuinely cares about them, so I think that kind of debate is saved for a minority and even then encouraging the suffering of others is ridiculous. edit: Sorry for my insecurity, and getting extremely defensive at first, I understand your perspectives now, I just picked a topic I felt strongly about it. The first one suggests don't do it because it makes others sad. But that argument could be used for the suicidal person. Don't live because it makes you sad. The second one "it can get better" works both ways. It can also get worse, and nothing is certain.
