For a soul food place that prides itself on their fried chicken, I was severely dissapointed! Who serves the breast piece deboned. The bone provides the juicy juicy and all the flavor. Instead I got an overcooked dry and inedible breast. I was starving so I forced myself to eat it by washing it down with lots of hot sauce. I ordered the chicken dinner with 2 sides, collards and cabbage which were both good. The cornbread pancake amuse was a nice starter as I waited 15 minutes for the chicken. I certainly dont mind the wait but dont serve me a well done piece of chicken when I can pay a fraction and get better fried chicken at popeye's or churches. I wont be back - yes it s possible they missed but you cant miss on fried chicken when that's one of your staples....it should be easy...like a layup for them...come on man!
