After Tito's death, there were far too many forces in the country to have it all work out. Everyone wanted fame and recognition, which had been held in place by the police. I was told beatings, imprisonment and a host of other methods were commonplace. The upside was peace and safety. The war afterwards was not necessary. In my humble opinion, the war happened because of the fact the three presidents (Tudman, Izetbegovic, Milosevic) all had too big of an ego and no idea of the consequences of their actions. The UN were originally not involved as far as I know, but later on, when it seemed like it could take forever, they made their move and sent troops, help etc. Coming from someone who is from Croatia, but was spared of the war since he lived in an unaffected area, as well as was a kid then, the war didn't have to happen, and it is sad people shed blood for the state we are in right now. It's chaotic and it doesn't look pretty. tldr: Tito dies. Hell ensues.,There are some documentaries available if you have access to youtube. The BBC one I saw earlier this week was pretty good. Lots of footage from parliament and thorough explanations. Be prepared though, none of it is HD (obviously, just due to the time period).','It had a civil war along ethnic lines. NATO came in as peacekeepers to stop ethnic cleansing until a political solution (breaking apart the country into several smaller countries) could be found.
