Whenever I see anime art, I can only think of how it has all of the negatives of classicism without embodying any of the positives. I see it as boring and without a point beyond just, "oh look at how pretty this is, isn't it so pretty?" All that I see are just a few stock charactersdesigns that are placed on a different backdrop. It all looks the same and there's little to no variation. I think of art as something that tries to evoke a meaning beyond just a literal interpretation (be that meaning political, emotional, or otherwise) and anime artmanga or whatever doesn't seem to do this. AT ALL. However, I am open to change so please show me how I'm wrong because I'd love to appreciate all different forms of art (although now I do not think of it as art). EDIT: Sorry, I am not referring to the anime shows as much as I am referring to the culture of drawings that surrounds it. Example: Sorry for any misconceptions due to my part. Also, I am referring to more modern kinds of art surrounding anime. I am a very big fan of Miyazaki, but I feel as though the large majority of anime-themed art is just derivative and doesn't break new ground. When things do break new ground (such as Takashi Murakami) I do like them.
