Chivalry, in some way or another, promotes the idea that men are supposed to provide everything for the inferior woman. Chivalry in a modern sense means: paying for all the meals, picking her up from her apartment and driving her back, and offering his chair or seat to a woman that's standing. While chivalry is flattering for women, it also reinforces the idea that women should get preferred treatment. I don't think you can have gender equality and chivalry coexist. Don't get me wrong - men should respect women at all times anyways, especially pregnant women. But the expectation that a guy should pay for every date (or even most of them) is sexist. Obviously women may try to play the chivalry card on a guy that wants to split the meal, but by encouraging chivalry, a woman is either 1) confirming her status as the weaker gender that the stronger male should provide for, 2) confirming the man's status as a weaker gender that should work for her benefit. EDIT1: I pay for all my date's meals, before anyone hops on the "you're an asshole!" train. This idea just lingers in my head. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
