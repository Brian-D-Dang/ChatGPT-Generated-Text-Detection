To me growth of economy is a meaningless statistic. Economy means exchange of goods and growth of economy is thus increase in exchange. What kind of person evaluates actions in their personal life based on this kind of statistic? For example, picking blueberries in the forest is extremely bad for growth of economy: low skill job and doing things yourself means you won't be buying blueberries from other people. Growth of economy means one should buy processed, marketed, branded food producs in the store and abandon working electronic devices whenever a new model comes to market. One could do that, yes, but I find it laughable how this is the priority goal for politicians - not health, literacy, justice, equality or some other virtue. When asked why economy should grow, they give contrived reasoning from dynamics of economy. They ignore that economy seems to work in cyclic process of growth and decline. Tragicomically many are ready to worsen living conditions of masses to accelerate economic growth. What is the point in all this? How can someone strongly support economic growth while having no interest in either means or results of it?
