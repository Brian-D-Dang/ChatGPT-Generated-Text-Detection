You feel the family ambiance as soon as you walk in. The server's are very attentive and greet you with their name. The food is great! My party of 4 had the Mamas Chicken Fried Steak Eggs, Mamas Breakfast Burrito, Denver Omelet and French Toast. The food was delicious! The restaurant is small however it's worth the wait.
