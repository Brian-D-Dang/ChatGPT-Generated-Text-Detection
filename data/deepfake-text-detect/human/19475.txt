It has never been owned by Argentina, there has never been an Argentine presence there, the British were the first people ever to live there. In fact The first British colony predates Argentina's existence as a state. In many ways Canada has a better claim to Alaska than Argentina does to the Falklands. At least Canada borders Alaska whereas you could literally fit France into the space between Argentina and the Falklands (not that the UK isn't very far away but once you're over 100km away I think self determination is the only important factor). However I am very aware that living in the UK may place me in something of an echo chamber so I would love to hear some reasoned opposition. I can't promise I haven't been brainwashed but I'll try to keep an open mind! Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
