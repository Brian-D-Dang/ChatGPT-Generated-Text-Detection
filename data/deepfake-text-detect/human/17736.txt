I had a discussion with a Muslim man on the Quran. I decided that the best thing to do would be to hear him out and let him explain his beliefs to me in detail. He did a good job. He really did. So good it should be his job converting people. However, when I asked him about some of the more violent aspects of it he replied simply with "It's all about how you interpret it...." That's where the conversation ended. I went home and thought hard about this. I went to work and thought about this. It's been nagging at me for days because when you ask any religious person about the questionable things in there literature that is ultimately their closing rebuttal. After much thought and debate I've come up with a theory. The theory is that most religions are ticking time bombs because of their "interpretation." I say this because I think that their interpretation is solely based on the present environment. We live in generally a stable community and therefore there is no need for violence. However, upon financial collapse, environmental collapse or civil unrest those interpretations would change drastically for the worst. Eventually things will get worse. It's inevitable in my opinion. We've seen the rise and fall of many civilizations and it's bound to happen again and when it does we will once again see religion at it's worse. Please, back me up or oppose me. Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Maybe I'm just being naive. I'm only 23 after all. Closure would be nice though.
