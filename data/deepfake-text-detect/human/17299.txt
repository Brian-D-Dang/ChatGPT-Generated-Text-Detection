The back story to this is that one of my friends found out that another was having sex with his girlfriend behind his back and when he confronted him, they got into a fight. Punches were thrown both ways but friend A who was cheated on beat friend B pretty badly. When the police came (not from noise but from the girl who called) friend B admitted "I don't want to press charges, I deserved it" and yet they are both facing possible jail time, possible suspension from school, and possible firing from jobs. I have also personally seen a fist fight settle the tension between two friends faster than any other option (between men at least). It is legal in hockey, boxing, etc so why not in every day life. Assuming: consent, no weapons, no damage to a third party property, no killing or extreme harm Edit: children sticking up to bullies is another example I thought of. I believe that fighting is the only way to end that situation and no amount of mediating, talking, punishment for the bully will end it entirely okay guys- very good points presented below, I enjoyed the mature debate. Opinions are like assholes, everyone has one and some may be shitty, but they are extremely important to society. Thanks
