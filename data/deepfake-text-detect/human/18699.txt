Income and wealth inequality had been increasing fairly consistently for the past 35 years. The trend seems to begin during the Carter Administration, when Democrats controlled the Presidency and both houses of Congress. From that point in time to the present, Republicans only controlled the Presidency and both houses of Congress for a total of four years, and those were two sessions of Congress during George W. Bush's presidency. The Democrats dominated the House throughout the 1980s, and controlled the Senate from . The Democrats have controlled the Senate since 2007, and held the House from 2007-2011. Obama has held the presidency since 2009. Income distributions have only gotten more unequal since Obama entered office. Please show me what I'm missing here. Somehow Democrats have gotten a good reputation for their record on inequality, much better than the Republicans, yet the Republicans do not seem to have had much (if any) of an advantage in terms of their policy-making ability. In fact, [looking at this list of states ranked by their Gini coefficients] , which measures inequality, 6-7 of the top 10 most equal states traditionally lean Republican, while the top 3 unequal states all traditionally lean Democrat. Washington, DC is the least equal of all, and many would consider DC to be a liberal stronghold. Please change my view and explain to me why Democrats are considered tougher on inequality.
