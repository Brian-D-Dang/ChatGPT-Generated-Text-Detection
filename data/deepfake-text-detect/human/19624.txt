As in title, my girlfriend opted to be an organ donor, before we got together. When I found out I'll admit I was upset. To my mind it feels as if you're not burying the person, just a few bits and bobs, rudely cut open and stolen from. I'm not religious (anymore, yay child brainwashing (but that's my opinion so ignore me), so that's not an excusereason. I just feel that saying goodbye to a person that they should be whole. Okay, say they've been dying for a while, you've had time to say your goodbyes properly, but if they die suddenly, then come back with a big cut and some rough stitches... There's something that doesn't feel right about it... It's like how people say after an autopsy the body comes back looking awful and bruised, seeming as the crack open ribs and all sorts (I say crack, I think they use a very sharp saw). It's an argument we've had before, and that we might end up having again now it's on my mind. ChangeMyViewers, can you make me see sense?
