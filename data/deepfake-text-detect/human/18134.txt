My perspective is that Suarez is a scumbag and a disgrace to the sport. For what it's worth, and by my own free admission, I tend to think the "honor" of a sport is more important than the average person. I really hate that taking a dive, faking an injury, and other gamesmanship techniques are not dealt with harshly. In any event, Rojas was given a lifetime ban for taking a dive (more info: ) in a game. Suarez was worse, he directly attacked another player, and has already been penalized for the exact same action. He should be thrown out forever, I don't care how talented he is. Thoughts?
