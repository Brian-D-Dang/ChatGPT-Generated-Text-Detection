Most people get offended by every single thing someone says about a race, nation or religion. If someone even mentions a race, they get hated. If you make a joke about Americans being fat, uneducated andor arrogant, I'm okay with that and can find funny in it with no offense even as a 'Murican. First of all, a joke is supposed to be funny and should not be taken seriously. Also, in my eyes, no statement is racist. Either you like someone, or you don't. Either you think something, or you don't. Either you believe something, or you don't. As for disorders such as dyslexia, everyone gets offended by dyslexia jokes except for people who have dyslexia, who are thankful for being able to find humor in their problem. Notice that [on this page] , along with jokes about dyslexics are letters from people who have viewed the page. Also notice that while there are plenty of letters scolding the author for his jokes about dyslexics, no such letters are from dyslexics. People who do write in claiming to have dyslexia do not complain about the jokes, and instead encourage them. IT should be like this for other discriminations. If I can find humor in who I am, that's good in itself. Who wants to try and change my view?
