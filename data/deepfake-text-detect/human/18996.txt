I believe that, by the time students reach high school, they have already decided what they want out of school. I teach 9th grade in high school in a struggling area, and day after day I fight the "motivation" battle with the students. Sure, I can motivate them in trivial ways. "If you do your assignment, you'll get a good grade or x privilege." However, I think it is impossible for a teacher to motivate a student long term if they do not already want to do well or to graduate themselves. Day after day, I have various students who tell me that they are just waiting until they turn 16 to drop out. I could talk to them about the benefits of a diploma until I'm blue in the face, but they come with their minds made up. I can provide positive support, hours and hours of unpaid time dedicated to helping them in school, but, in the end, some students just won't care and can't be made to. CMV?
