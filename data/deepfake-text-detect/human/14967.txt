The Peppermill defies description. Refined tackiness. Utterly Craptastic. Could it be that a Flamingo exploded in this place to give it the outragious pink hues? All kidding aside, the best thing about this restaurant is the decor. It screams cheesiness and vintage Vegas, with its faux neon lights and the veritable faux forest. When was the last time you saw a deciduous tree in the middle of the desert? I love the decor, and make sure that I always step into the lounge, open 24 hours a day, to see the fire and water fountain as well as the cocktail servers in the evening gowns split up to...here. Now to the substance. Peppermill is an institution. It has been around seeming forever, and had a scene from Casino filmed there with Sharon Stone. The food is average, at best. It is also overpriced. The place is best on its breakfast foods, in my humble opinion. The omelets are huge, but again, overpriced. The appetizer sampler platter is good, but overpriced. Oddly enough, the onion rings on the appetizer platter are different than the onion rings as a side item. I recommend this place for drinks in the lounge, and for breakfast on the weekends if you are staying on the Strip. The place, while overpriced, is still cheaper than the buffet. And more fun. Are you noticing a trend here? I will hit you over the head with it one more time...overpriced.
