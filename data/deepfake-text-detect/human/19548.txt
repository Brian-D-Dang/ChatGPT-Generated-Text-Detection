I read a lot of alarmist stuff about drinking soda. 6 years ago, before I got diagnosed with ADHD, I was unknowingly self-medicating with caffeine by chugging upwards of 6 cans of regular Coke per day. I maxed out at 260 pounds. Once I started treating my ADHD correctly, I cut down but did not completely stop my soda intake. I enjoy food, and while I recognize that there is a great risk of "eatingdrinking your feelings" for people who get a lot of enjoyment out of it, it did not stop me from losing (and keeping off) 60 pounds over the last six years. So, keep in mind that I'm not talking about OVERCONSUMPTION. I'm talking about one cup of soda per day, maybe a bit more, maybe a bit less. There are all kinds of anecdotes about how why Coke is bad for you. It rots your teeth; they use it to clean blood off the highway after accidents; Coke has so much sugar that if the taste wasn't tempered by carbonation, you would vomit immediately upon drinking it; one soda per day can make you gain 15 pounds per year; and so on. Well, I have been drinking at least one soda per day for the past six years, but I have lost sixty pounds. I do my best to exercise regularly, get outside regularly, and keep my nutritional intake balanced: lots of veggies and lean meats, not many processed foods and simple carbs. In terms of dental health, I've had two cavities in about ten years. I have a family history of high blood pressure, but when I keep on my nutrition exercise habits, my numbers are all well within a health range, even when I drink about one soda per day. Are there hidden costs? Is my risk of some type of cancer skyrocketing even though I appear to be functionally getting healthier? Cut through the hype, Reddit, and CMV.
