I always hear people say "I want so and so" or "I want to have kidsget marriedwhatever." I always hear "I want," not "I need." Is it just people I'm around or people in general that make me feel this way? And like all other threads in the subreddit, CMV. Also, I don't think anyone directly forced the opinion if love being a want because alot of people, honestly (imo) are dumb. I guess I built it up over time? Lol.
