I have been to other GBK locations (London) and was in the mood for a great burger but I was so disappointed! I typically would have given the other location I visited 4 stars so I had expectations. I ordered a buffalo burger. Sorry, no buffalo today. So I said I'll take a regular burger with cheddar. Plain. No sauces. No salad. No toppings. And an order of sweet potato fries. Sorry, no sweet potato today. Ok, onion rings. So I wait for what seems like an eternity for my burger (and the place only has about 4 tables with customers...mid afternoon) and the burger is wrong and the onion rings are burnt. The burger has lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, mayo and salsa. I send it back and it returns less than a minute later. I asked the waitress if they just scraped off the toppings, to which she answered no but when I lifted the bun, I showed her the remains of the salsa. Walked out without eating lunch. Won't be back to this location.
