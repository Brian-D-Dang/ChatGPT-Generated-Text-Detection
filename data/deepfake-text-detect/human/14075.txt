Marion liked the boy who lived in the apartment next door. Every day she would try to ask his name but he never looked her way. Finally she got desperate and asked his mom what his name was. His mom smiled and told her that Ron had been wondering her name too. Marion politely gave her name, thanked Ron's mom and went home happy.
