Just started my first job and I took a lot of time to make sure my W4 was filled out correctly so that I can maximize each paycheck without too little withheld. When I asked others for help seems like very few people knew about the nuances of W4s and they all were too afraid to pay too little taxes fearing huge backlash from IRS at tax time. And alot of people get refunds each year in the thousands so that means the government is getting millions in interest-free loans from the people. So why not have an option for people to pay the IRS directly each year instead of having it deducted from each paycheck. And then just send them a tax bill each year so they have until April 1st to pay up that bill. This way people maximize their spending power to boost economy and the government is not getting interest-free loans at the expense of its people.
