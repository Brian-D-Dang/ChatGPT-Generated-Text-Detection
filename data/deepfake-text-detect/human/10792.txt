The inside of your eye is lined with a viscous fluid called the vitreous humor. This gel is attached to your retina, the light sensing part inside of the eye. Normally with age, the vitreous will start detaching from the retina starting from the periphery of your retina (the far sides of your vision). As it is detaching, the pull the vitreous performs on the retina can cause the retina to either send signals (seeing brightness) or stop signals (seeing shadow, spots of darkness). You may only be seeing the brightness when it is dark because the actual signal is too low in normal light. The gap that forms in the detachment will be filled with clear fluid. It may be worth just going to an eye doctor to get a full eye examination just in case.
