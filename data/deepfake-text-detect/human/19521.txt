Being a college student, I get the chance to interact with student athletes on a daily basis. I am not saying this is true about all athletes, but some that I have met take courses designed specifically for athletes, that require little to no work at all. At the same time, most of these athletes are on athletic scholarships, meaning they pay little to none to go to college, all because they play a sport. I am also not saying that sports are not important and are do not require hard work and time commitment. However, I believe that in order for these athletes to get scholarships, they should have to go through the same process for academic scholarships (i.e. writing essays, good high school grades). If are not given a scholarship through this process, they should have to pay for school with their own money or with financial aid, just like non-college athletes. EDIT1: I understand that college athletics is a business, and to keep the business running, scholarships need to be given out. Right now, I do not believe this fair, especially to non-college athletes who work just as hard and are not given scholarships at the same rate college athletes are. Hello, users of CMV!
