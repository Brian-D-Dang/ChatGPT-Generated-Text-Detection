This is the worst place ever!!!!!! The people are ugly. It costs way too much. The place is dirty wouldn't be surprised if you could get an STD by just sitting in one of there nasty seats. The drinks cost way to much and on top of the 30 cover there is a 2 drink minimum. The biggest waste of time in Vegas. And FYI not gay friendly just if your wondering
