The Mule, while not a physically imposing being, was an extremely intelligent one, and that mixed with his peculiar condition, he would have made a strong, intelligent, and efficient Emperor. I believe that he would have been able to craft an Empire that would survive his death, and survive thousands of years longer than the First Empire would. Regardless of whether or not his abilities would have been passed down, the human race would have benefited from such an Empire, returning to the glory and surpassing the glory of the First Empire. And if his genes had passed down, I believe that the humans still would have been better off- true, they may have been slowly turned into a lower class, but they would be so as the happiest, most content, fulfilled beings ever to live, and since what they would feel would seem genuine to them, their free will matters not. CMV Edit: I am referencing the series Foundation, by Isaac Asimov, in particular the second book in the series, Foundation and Empire. I am not the Mule's man.
