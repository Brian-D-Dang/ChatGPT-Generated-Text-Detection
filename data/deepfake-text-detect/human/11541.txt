Scan is a feature on Snapchat that allows users to get more information on objects around them. Snap launched the feature last year at its Partner Summit. New features for Scan were announced at this year's Snap Partner Summit, which was an online-only event. Users will now be able to use Scan to identify dog breeds and plant species, look up nutrition information for food, and more.
