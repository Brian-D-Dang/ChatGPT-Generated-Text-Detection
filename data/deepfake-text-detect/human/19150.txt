I believe that PEDs should be legal in sports. Here is a simple list of reasons why I believe this: I have good deal of experience in bodybuilding and powerlifting, I have realized through attempting workout routines used by professionals and know steroid users like Franco Columbu [His workout routine] , which I found to be very difficult with standard recovery, and through my casual research that steroids are by no means a free ride, someone on PEDs is only given the ability to work that much harder toward his goals by decreased recovery times Sports are entertainment, as a fan, I don't think that we should be holding athletes back if they are willing to put in the extra effort in training and the stress on their bodies. It would be lucrative for media companies that televise sporting events because they would be displaying a higher level of competition. Many top athletes were already top athletes before they even took PEDs (Barry Bonds, Lance Armstrong) meaning that steroids by no means replace natural talent. I'm currently in college and I know many high school athletes that use PEDs, and it is even more prevalent in college, so if you believe this is a problem, it is certainly not being solved by policing only the upper echelons of sports. I say these things not because I want Steroids legalized (I would never do them) I am an entirely natural athlete, using only vitamins and whey protein. Some [BroScience] ( for Levity)
