Galt's Gulch Chile, Free State Project, and other libertarians attempts to implement AnarchCap ideals are failing or failed due to the unpersuasive and unimplementable nature of AnarchCap ideology. Whether intentionally attempting to defraud AnarchCap believers of their money or inability of the idealogy to move into the space of currently functioning (functioning enough at least) of mixed economy that exists in rack of those spaces. In the case of Detroit, the mixed economy (light handed pseudo-democratic socialism) that already exists there has as close as imaginable failed yet AnarchCap ideologues haven't swarmed to the city to implement their ideals in a space that not only is open to radical departure from the conventional wisdom but also abandonment of expectations of what could be done. The reason that I believe that AnarchCap ideology hasn't made Detroit the mecca and demonstration market for their ideals, is because even believers latently believe that AnarchCap beliefs would fail spectacularly and discredit their criticism of stateinvoluntary regulations that provide a floor of economic benefits to the population even though the majority of population in Detroit live incredibly near such a economic floor it is better than likely absolute failure of that AnarchCap would provide as an alternative. Whole square miles of Detroit have been forsakened by the city government, and AnarchCap innately understands and acknowledges that actually attempting to implement its ideology would assure rejection of it forever, left on the dustbin of history. As long as AnarchCap is never truly attempted, believers are able to criticize the current economic status quo without ever venturing an actual attempt and never capable of real world implementation that would receive justifiably criticism.
