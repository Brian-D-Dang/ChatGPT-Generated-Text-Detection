A [private copying levy] is a levy or tax that is charged on purchases of recordable media. Such levies have been instituted in several countries to compensate content producers for the inevitable private copying of their product enabled by consumer recordable media. Notice, in particular, that the levy is collected on the assumption that the media will be used to privately copy copyrighted content, regardless of whether it happens or not. The levy exists as a compensation scheme for copyright holders for alleged losses incurred from lost sales. I argue that this scheme provides fair compensation to the copyright holders as negotiated between their representatives and the government which, barring commercial use, provides end users with a moral (if not legal) license to copy and distribute as much content as they want. Notice that this reasoning excludes content for which no private copying levy exists, countries where it doesn't exist and commercial use of private copying (e.g. re-selling of private copies for profit).
