There is plenty of'decorative' concrete that has pigments added, or more commonly, is stained or etched with acids after the concrete has been poured. But to properly color concrete, you really need to control all the variables extremely well; add too much water to one load and it will be a different color than the next. So the colors often don't end up uniform, and to be uniform it's easier to paint them anyway.," "Concrete can be made in various colors and the color can be kept consistent from batch to batch with little issue. The reason why we pour grey is cost and performance. Adding a pigment to concrete may change its strength necessitating the pouring of thicker concrete which would increase cost and weight. The structure may also require additional maintenance or fail quicker from the pigments changing its durability. It's best to limit variables when engineering a structure, and added pigment is an unecessary variable. You are more than welcome to pour a purple patio, but you are unlikely to see a yellow overpass.
