There are special memory chips on the motherboard that contain the BIOS. In ancient times, these were actual ROMs, read-only memory chips. That's too hard to maintain, so today most mobos use flash memory, like in a USB drive or camera card, to store the BIOS. That way you can do a firmware update with a special program rather than screwdrivers.,There is a chip that contains the BIOS, similar to a ROM. It is connected to the board. Sometimes a board can contain more than one BIOS.','How is it physically installed? Well at the factory they hook it up to a computer that loads it onto the motherboard, Im not sure how they do it now but back in the day they used to do it through the keyboard port. Once loaded it was stored on a chip like flash memory that you can carry on your keychain but physically attached to the board. Maybe someone can answer how they do it now, I assume they do it via the USB ports now.
