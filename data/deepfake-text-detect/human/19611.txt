Building on a previous CMV I think that stimulants should be sold to people much in the same way alcohol is. It would be sold to only people over 21 much in the same way alcohol is. The focus would help them learn more and help them complete higher education, the primary people who would really need it. Of course there would be people who abuse it, but people will abuse anything. If it became available, education to children about dependence could be taught in the same way that other drugs are taught.
