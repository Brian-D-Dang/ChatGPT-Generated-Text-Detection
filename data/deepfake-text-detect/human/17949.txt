I think that nature has given us humans nothing but trouble. That all the good thing we have gotten from nature are things we have either stolen or coerced out of it. I think that when people say we should go back to our nature, or that we should live more in accordance with nature, they are mistaking a fantasy version of nature, where all the animals are friends, with the real deal where every day is a life and death struggle against hunger, disease and predation. I think that the nature of nature is cruel bordering on evil and that the less we have do with it the better. That instead of embracing our place in the natural order of things, we should seek to remove ourselves from the system entirely. bedtime... i'll check in again tomorrow
