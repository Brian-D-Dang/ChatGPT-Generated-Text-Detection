I have friends that say gay slurs or say racist remarks in a joking way. While I understand some joking around, I draw the line with words like nigger and fagfaggot. Every time I hear those words, it goes right through me, and makes me angry that they use those words. They are saying it in a joking way and they are not really racist or anti-homosexual. In fact I have friends that are gay or bisexual that say fag a lot, but that still bothers me. My friends are gamers, and for some reason gamers like to say these words often. The words bother me greatly though and sometimes are negatively impacting my relationships with my friends. I believe that even though you say these things in a jokingly matter that it gives credence to when racistanti-gay people use them. That outsiders will just assume that they are racistanti-gay for using them. If I hear someone that i do not know use slurs, I will automatically assume they are racist or anti-gay. I have been around racial tension situations while growing up and seen gay people ostracized around me. I have heard people say these things and mean them in hate. I think I have a hard time separating seeing people saying them in hate and people that use them casually. It just bothers me a lot. Try to change my view. Maybe there is something I'm not thinking about. Edit: I am a generation older than most of my friends too. Edit: My view has been changed somewhat by Grunt08 and a little bit with everyone's help. I realize I need to be angry at the person, for how they are using the word, not at the actual words themselves. I still dislike the usage of the words but I need to take more time looking at the context before making snap judgments.
