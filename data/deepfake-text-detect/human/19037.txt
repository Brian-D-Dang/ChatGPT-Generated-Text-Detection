I believe they do the very thing they think men do. They place one gender in a box and over generalize. If a man says something like "not all men" it is ridiculed and that man is often labled as insensative or a misogynist. I really do not understand this form of logic. Some black people steal, but not all of them do, so therefore I should not define black people by the few that happen to commit crimes. Shouldn't the same logic extend here. Not all men commit sexual violence towards women, so using those few to define a whole gender is incorrect. Someone please make a case as to why Feminism is inclusive to men. Explain to me why a man should respect or join the feminist movement. I feel like we can all advocate for equality without having to blame a certain group or overgeneralize a whole gender. And to avoid hypocricy... not all feminists do this. They really don't. I have met some great women and men that identified as a feminist. But it is hard to discount that this group has gotten out of hand. Often the loudest voices recieve the most attention and usually those voices come from the mouths of radical people. That said, the unfortunate truth is feminism either has a bad PR problem or it is becoming a radicalized shell of its former self. Change my view... Hello, users of CMV!
