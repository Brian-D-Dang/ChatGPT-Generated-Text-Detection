Although I see Sadam Hussein as an unjust dictator that ruthlessly ruled the nation of Iraq, and I can understand the sentiment that he and his party deserved to be removed from power, I do not think the invasion provided any benefit to the region, or much (if any) long term safety to the region or to America. As we know now, the claims of the Iraqi's possession of WMDs were misinformed, and the Iraqis had little (if anything) to do with the attacks on September 11th. I also feel as though a somewhat racist anti muslimarab sentiment brewed in America after the attacks and this helped raise public support for a hasty and misguided war. Hello, users of CMV!
