Bring a sweater! They keep it coooold in here. I think all Starbucks are cold in order to get you to buy some hot coffee. This Starbucks was clean, had friendly staff, and had outlets for me to use- always a plus. Of course, I was lucky they weren't crowed on Saturday afternoon. There's a nice covered outdoor area to relax and enjoy your purchase as well. If I lived closer, I'd frequent this particular Starbucks.
