I never realized there was another world beyond the mirror. I always took Lewis's beyond the looking glass as fiction. Until I saw myself killed in the mirror. 99.9 of realities are identical because parallel universes are connected but I fell into the.1 percent. The irregularity in our universes happened when I was looking in the mirror, every universe is separated by a single choice and I saw the difference in our universes myself. I was killed and the person who did it couldn't see ME through the mirror, but I saw him. Who was he why did he kill me? I don't know but I have to know. I tried for the first time touching the mirror since my "reflection" was killed, my hand went through and I decided to make the choice to go find what that single choice between my life and death was. I'm going beyond the looking glass and I don't know if I'll be coming back. But it doesn't matter I realize it never mattered, I'm one of many and we will always find our way through
