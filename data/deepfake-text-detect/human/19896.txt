You don't have to qualify as a low information voter to find yourself uninformed while filling out a general election ballot. I believe that we'd better enable voters to make informed decisions if ballots indicated who was running for reelection and who was challenging the incumbent. 1. When a voter is at a loss for who to vote for, they'd at least be able to make an informed "right trackwrong track" vote, rather than having to rely on party affiliation. I believe that party affiliation isn't especially informative, particularly on the state and local level. For example: I might not know whether to trust the Democrats or Republicans to run my state's Department of Education, but if I have children in public schools I'd know whether I approved of the current leader's handling of the Common Core rollout. To take this argument further what's more pertinent when voting for the head of your local sanitation department: party affiliation or whether your trash is being picked up on time? 2. This new dynamic could potentially make politicians more sensitive to general malaise such as we're seeing now. Long shot: politicians seek to actually get beneficial stuff done prior to elections, rather than pursue wedge issues. 3. This could potentially make a dent in the 90 incumbency rates we're seeing for certain offices. BONUS CMV: I believe that voters should be able to cast "no confidence" votes in their government, i.e. a "straight ticket" vote against all incumbents, rather than for a particular party. I imagine that this option would become fairly popular among voters should it be enacted, and that this new dynamic would lead politicians to better cooperate with one another.
