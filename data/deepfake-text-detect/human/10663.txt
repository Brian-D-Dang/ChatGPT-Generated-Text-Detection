Most likely because light has no mass. A sonic boom is caused as something moves through the air disrupting the molecules, while light just passes through the air.','Sonic booms occur when an object is attempting to move through the air faster than the air can get out of the way, in a very simple manner of explaining. This causes the air to compress and pile up in a peculiar way, usually creating an extremely dense wave of air molecules that are dragged along by the object. Your ears interpret this pile-up of molecules as a boom. Or two. Light does not interact with air molecules in any meaningful way that would cause the aforementioned effects. Light is an electromagnetic wave, not an object that needs to move air molecules around it like an airplane or rocket would.
