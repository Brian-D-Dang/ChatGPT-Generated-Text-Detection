I had a lot of fun with this yesterday so wanted to give a different, more serious, type of topic a shot. If capital punishment is to be carried out, it is supposed to be carried out in the most humane way possible. I feel that the current methods do not fulfill this requirement. The main reason behind my thinking is that, when looking at each method of capital punishment there are ways it can be botched. It would take a while to go through each one, but some examples are: Lethal Injection: injection of a muscle can cause extreme pain, wrong dosages of medication can cause patients to be unable to move, but still feel the pain Electrocution: First charge of electricity failing to kill Gas Chamber: Death due to slow asphyxiation instead of passing out from gas. This [link] shows many examples of botched executions that have occurred in the United States. I feel like there are way too many examples, especially when you consider the number of inmates that are executed a year. These botched executions lead to immense pain and suffering for the clients. I don't want to discuss whether or not the death penalty is morally just or under what type of crimes it should be granted. The question here is whether or not any of the current methods of legal execution (Lethal Injection, Electrocution, Gas Chamber, Firing Squad, Hanging) can be considered humane. My current belief is that due to all the complications, that can and do occur, there is currently no method. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
