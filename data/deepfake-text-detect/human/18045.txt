USA citizen here. I was debating the PRISM scandal with my father, and he convinced me that this scandal isn't as huge a deal as it seems. He's typically a hardcore conservative, and I was shocked when he brought up some more balanced points to defend his argument. While the NSA's actions are against the fourth amendment, I think he may have a point. The view I currently hold is based on these points: 1) This system has not been proven ineffective. While we can fixate on failed instances, such as the Boston Bombers, there are countless threats disarmed from the information gathered by the NSA. 2) Blaming Obama with this program, which was conceptualized by another president, would make Democrats look rotten. This would give Republicans a quick and easy issue to critique Obama for in upcoming elections. Please, change my view!
