I think that the whole thing is a little silly and overblown. I pronounce the abbreviation with a hard g. I do it because it is how I learned it, and because the g stands for graphics, which has a hard g. I will probably never get out of the habit of saying it this way, and that's fine with me. I have people tell me that I'm saying it "wrong," or praise me for saying it "right" all the time. I know the whole story of how the gentleman who invented the .gif is adamant about how it be pronounced like the peanut butter. I know that people say that since he invented it, he gets pronunciation rights. But I still don't understand why it matters so much. We all know what an individual means when they say it either way, so why should it matter? I could hypothetically see the problem if it was at all confusing, but it is not. So here's the deal, if someone can give me a compelling argument to change the way that I say it, then I will do my best to shift my habits. And you will get a delta. Hello, users of CMV!
