No. The short answer is that both hypoxia (not enough oxygen in cells) and hyperoxia (too much oxygen in cells) are linked to oxidative and reductive stress on cells, which can lead to apoptosis (cell induced cell death) and the activation of many different transcription factors, some of which promote inflammation neglect anti-inflammatory genes, thus can lead to cancer.
