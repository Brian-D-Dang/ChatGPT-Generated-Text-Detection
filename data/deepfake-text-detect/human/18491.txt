I don't understand what is the genius about either of their work. What has been or is Woody Allen's great contribution to cinematography? I dont have any knowledge of what advances or breakthroughs Allen has had in his field. Just to name a ranfom few, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas or Alfred Hitchcock seem to have much much more merit than Allen. I understand Spielberg's, Lucas', and Hitchcock's contributions to cinematography and I agree with the recognition they have received for it, but Allen? Why is he so revered? Is there a movie of his I should watch that would make me understand why he is such a big deal in Hollywood? Regarding Barbara Streisand, I've never heard Streisand singing in a way that made me think she was truly amazing. What I've heard was average, at best. Is she valued for her singing voice or is it for her showmanship? Or maybe she is an amazing composer? I really don't understand all the hype. Anybody here care to enlighten me and change my view? Thank you.
