Service was really great! My friend and I came in on a Wednesday and there was only 1 other person in line. Since I had never eaten at Pinkberry before, the girl that served us was really helpful in explaining how they work compared to most places (no self-serve, no price based on weight) and about the flavors. There weren't many flavors (namely, no vanilla) which was kind of a downer, but the fresh toppings and the quality of the fro-yo really made up for it. The original was somewhere in between greek yogurt and vanilla ice cream. I had oreo topping, which made the whole thing taste like cookies and cream ice cream, with a lot less calories. The store is very small with only a few tables close together but the Arboretum has plenty of benches and seating around it to use. The price was pretty reasonable for the amount received. I enjoyed it quite a bit.
