Almost all the videos on youtube now, have to be postponed to watch some short 15-30 second commercial that I don't give a shit about, or a 3 minute trailer or commercial that I just skip immediately after I hit the 5 second mark. Youtube seems like it would have been just as popular without all the advertising, with people uploading as much entertaining content without the benefit of being paid. Sure, there would be less and larger gaps between in time, but quality always trumps quality. I'm curious what people's opposition is on this. CMV.
