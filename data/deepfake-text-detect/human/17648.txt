I believe that in the United States, marriage should be removed as it follows religious rules and doctrine in most parts of the US. I believe that this is absolutely in the jurisdiction of the church and should remain there, allowing churches to marry people as they deem appropriate. I believe this because of our separation of church and state. Civil Unions that are based in secular principles should replace the marriage institution. Any adult able to consent to a contract would be able to form a union with another individual. (Or other individuals, but that is a different discussion.) This would grant the same benefits marriage currently has. It may seem like just a name change, but its a fundamental shift in philosophy. Change my view?
