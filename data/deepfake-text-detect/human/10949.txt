I work for Fedex. Your package started in Shanghai which is probably where your shit was made. Shanghai is one of Fedex's largest International Hubs. It has to get customs cleared, which your package seems to have done fairly quickly. Crosses over into Alaska (Connecting Hub for all Asian International flights) then proceeds to TN (Which is Fedex's LargestMain Hub). We work off what is called a spoke and wheel model. Have a bunch of places all around the US that all fly their packages into Memphis, TN which is accounted for then redistributed to other locations away from Memphis. If your stuff is going to NY, it possibly will stop by Newark by plane or travel by Semi to a station close to you. Definitely not ELI5, but ya.," "I don't follow from what I see, it was picked up in Shanghai, then moved to Alaska, then to Tennessee. Where's the part that says it was in the US before it was in China?,Seriously? Each stop has times and dates next to them.
