Let me preface this by saying I do not have a degree in math nor is math one of my strengths but I find it interesting. Also it would be really awesome if a mathematician chimed in on this and gave us their perspective. Alright so here we go. Unless you believe reality is created in our minds I think we can agree that particles (such as protons or electrons) follow laws that are not contingent upon our existance. While these laws require creativity, and insight to discover they are not a product of the human mind but "exist" independent of us, thus making them a discovery and not an invention. I believe math is analogous. My argument is pretty simple. Mathematical objects (such as numbers) obey sets of rules just like particles do. These rules are not arbitrary or the result of the human mind but "exist" in the same sense as the laws that govern particle physics. So why say that math is invented and not another property of reality to be discovered? CMV!
