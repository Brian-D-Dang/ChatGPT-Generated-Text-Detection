Madeira is a "fortified wine," meaning that its alcohol content is made much higher than traditional wine. This was to prevent spoilage on long sea journeys. Since alcohol is a preservative, the wine keeps for longer (Madeira and Marsala are also very sweet, and sugar is another preservarive). Really old bottles are expensive because they're rare. No one knows the quality until they drink the wine.
