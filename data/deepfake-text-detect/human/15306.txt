We are locals and dine at Ferraro's a lot, but we won't be back. The food was good but not the service. We went there with a restaurant.com cert which irritated the server, and the time before we went for their locals promotion only to be treated the same way. When our bill was presented she took the cert and when it was returned to us their was a 3.00 difference same with the locals promotion. She also had charged us for the most expensive glass of wine when we had the less expensive wine. We purchased two glasses at the bar at one price and were charged more at the table for the second glasses. This is the third time we have been treated this way by the same server. If they are going to offer specials they should honor them. We have dined and spent a lot there without discounts there was no reason to do this. We will not be back. Also the 18 gratuity that she added on the second bill was not necessary my daughter works in the industry so we always tip 20 to 25 so she lost out, wrong person to do this to. Never again
