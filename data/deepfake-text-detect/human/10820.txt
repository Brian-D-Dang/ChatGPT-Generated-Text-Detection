Most research into batteries for a while was limited to figuring out how to make them smaller, cram more of them in, or on limiting power consumption. There is research being put into a new kind of Lithium-ion battery which (somehow through putting holes in it, I don't understand the physics) have much longer lives than current batteries. But, like any technology innovation there are a lot of false starts and bad rabbit holes.,We have not discovered many new ways to efficiently hold electricity. Most batteries in use today still use the same chemical processes like the ones decades ago.','Batteries are kind of like cars. They have been around for a long time so people have figured out a lot of stuff about how to make them better so there are no new easy answers. Batteries and cars will always get better but no one expects gas mileage of a regular car to double in a couple years. Processing power gets better really fast. The power in processors roughly doubles ever 1.5 to 2 years. That is amazing; that is a miracle; that is not normal. Processors are very special, people have said that they will have to stop improving so fast for a long time, but so far they keep getting better. Processors are not a good thing to compare to.', "Batteries get better, then the devices that run on them grow larger power demands to compensate. Just like computer processors get faster, then the OSs that run on them get bigger to use all that available power. In the mid 80's a fast computer was 25 MHz. Today a computer that looks just as fast is 2000 MHz. Also, we're making new discoveries in better chemical reactions to use in batteries that will store more power and last longer, but the journey from discovering a reaction and getting it to the point where it can be manufactured affordably, in bulk, and still be reliable takes a good number of years.
