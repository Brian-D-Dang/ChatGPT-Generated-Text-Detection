Microsoft has agreed to make it easier for customers to independently repair its devices. As You Sow, an investor advocacy nonprofit, filed a shareholder resolution with the SEC in June requesting that Microsoft examine the environmental and social benefits of making its devices more easily repairable. The shareholder resolution was withdrawn after Microsoft made a series of critical concessions and committed to examining its repairs situation. The FTC agreed to adopt the stance that people should be able to repair their own gadgets in July.
