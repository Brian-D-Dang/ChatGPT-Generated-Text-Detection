Son, don't call me that. A compulsive liar? Well, if you're convinced that I am a compulsive liar, no defense of mine can change your mind. I'm damned if I argue, and I'm damned if I don't, so I'm only going to say one thing, and I want you to think really hard about your accusation now: One day I will be gone, and all that will be left are memories of me and the stories I shared. Stories of my own father. Well, I hope that the stories you tell your kids aren't lies. I hope you paint me fairly as I painted your granddad. These are my wishes, but do what you will.
