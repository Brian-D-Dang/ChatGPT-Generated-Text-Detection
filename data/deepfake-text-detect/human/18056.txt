So the UK has for some reason decided to have mandatory voter registration apparently to encourage more people to vote (despite registrations plummeting after they changed the system). I never understood the logic of this, what if you really don't want a part in the electoral system and don't want to be bothered by the mailshots, canvassers, details being sold to some company etc. that all happens around election time and simply want to get on without paying attention to elections etc. then surely you should have the right to be "forgotten" from the election roll? Or what about wanting to avoid Jury Duty and the other things on the roll they don't tell you about. If its something people actually see worthwhile they will register and vote (i.e Scotland), the current state of politics is probably why thousands don't care about being registered. Its not the process its the whole system Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
