I took my Yelp friend Irene V. here the other day to get a pedicure with me and I was not surprised when she said she loved the place! Sigh, I'd let you in on my secret haven. Imagine the Barber Shop, that the kind of place this is in real life. Place is clean, unpretentious and the price extremely reasonable. There are two ladies there who does the pedi and mani. A spa pedi is 22 (only!) and a gel French manicure is 25 (only!). I have been going to Traci but both Traci and Eva will do a fantastic job. They also have hair cut, coloring, lash extension, and facial services. What I mean though about it being like the Barber Shop is that I do on occasion go in to shoot the breeze with the ladies. Both of them are extremely nice and friendly and we will sit around and chat as though we're sitting on a front porch somewhere waving our fans, having lemonade. There you have it- the best kept secret and my safe haven has been yelped!!! Well, guess these ladies are so nice and so great- everyone should know about them. Except of course when I want to get my nails done or go in for a chat!!!!
