My reasoning is this: Russia's economy to start with was horrible after the fall of the Soviet Union. To compound this issue, the US has issued import bans on many things such as ammunition, firearms, etc; And It continues to undermine the already bad economy of Russia. With the Russian economy tanked, Putin has one or two options from my view. 1: He has to watch his country slowly die, or 2: He does something about it, to try to help his country. The way that the "Old Country" or the USSR gained massive power was through the items the other countries held, and by taking those countries over, they gained economic power. So to gain some economic power or leverage in the horrendous economy, Putin goes after the Ukraine, because he doesn't want to watch his country die slowly. This is not to say that it is a perfect decision, or the one I would make; But that It is both a justified and unjustifiable position. The Justification being that he doesn't want to see his country die, but the unjustification being that War for money shouldn't be a thing in my eyes. Hello, users of CMV!
