Entry No. 56-Day 124 It's been a week since I made the discovery. I know I should tell them..... but it would ruin us all. I haven't slept since I discovered it. I may be going mad. Celera Genomics didn't know what they were messing with-sure our intentions were fine, but we weren't ready for this. Entry No. 59-Day 127 I've decided to try and appear as if it's all fine. I'm going to take this to my grave if I can. I'll have to misdirect my colleagues. It won't be easy but I must do this. It's critical for our survival. Entry No. 64-Day 135 This will be my last entry. The project has been terminated. One of my German colleagues found my research this morning. They've halted all research. I suppose it doesn't matter. Nothing matters.
