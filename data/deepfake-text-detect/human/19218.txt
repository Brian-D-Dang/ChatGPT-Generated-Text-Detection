I am 21 yo. I believe love is an illusiondelusion where you believe that your partner is the only and perfect one for you and you plan to spend the rest of your life with. Love is a state of mind, just as loneliness and hapiness. I can be alone without feeling lonely, the same way I can have a short realtionship and still feel love. But I don't believe if your goal is a short term relationship, it contains any love, only lust. This view of love makes it impossible for me to accept polygamy polyamory, other than for sexual drifts. The only relation I've had lasted 4 years and I got cheated on in the end. This made me very paranoid of being cheated on again. I just discovered my newfound love is very open minded about the concept of love and polygamy polyamory and this made me even more worried. Please, help me CMV !
