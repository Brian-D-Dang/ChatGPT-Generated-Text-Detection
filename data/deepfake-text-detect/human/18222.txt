I'm from the UK and so this view is largely derived from the football (aka soccer) here. The England team frequently have managers from nationalities other than English. This seems wrong to me. All members of a national team, including background staff, such as coaches, managers, trainers etc should be of the English (and whatever other country's) nationality.I believe that a country's national sports team is them representing themselves in that sport, on and off the field. So, by having someone of a different nationality influencing the result, even if they're not the actual sportsperson and part of the background staff, this seems unfair as it is not entirely that country. For instance, just like you wouldn't have a Swedish football player playing for the England squad, you equally wouldn't have a Swedish manager managing the England team. All positions in a national team should be like a duty, not a job, and they shouldn't be applicable to anyone. This should be mandatory for all nations and applied to all sports.
