Now don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with gays. They have just as much as a right to their relationships as I do. But why do so many of them have to be up in your face flamboyant? It alienates them further from the existing culture and in a world where people already don't like them for being different, why would they go out of their way to make that worse. I know not all gays are like that, but god damn a lot are. I can't stand the idea of gay pride parades as it separates them from the common public already. It upsets me In the same way black history month upsets me. If you wanna be accepted as part of the common public, stop trying purposefully to alienate yourself from the common public. Don't think I'm bigoted, because I'm not. Edit: it seems people are getting me all wrong with my definition of a flamboyant gay Man. I'm not talking about a man with a limp wrist or a twang in his voice. I'm talking about the person who let's their sexuality define their entire life. Someone who limits themselves to being all about their sexuality. Instead of being a person who happens to be a homosexual, they are just a homosexual. They aren't any kind of interesting person, they are a very flat person.
