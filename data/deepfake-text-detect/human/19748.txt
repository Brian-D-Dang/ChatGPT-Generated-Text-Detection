This might be an extremely big stretch, but I recently decided to rewatch the show and have noticed certain things about Todd Packer. If you've seen the show, you'd know that Packer is a raging pervert and he usually is found giving many inappropriate comments. More specifically, inappropriate comments about women. With this, it could be a safe assumption to think Packer straight. On the other hand, every single time he makes any physical contact with anyone, they're male. Every single time, and it's usually humping or other waaay over-the-line stuff. In the St. Patrick's episode, he makes contact with Meredith, but that's even a little gay because she was on top of him, making him the "catcher." Coming from an actual, real life homosexual, I think that Todd Packer could never be 100 straight, and that if someone got him either drunk enough or in the right mood, he would happily consent to having intercourse with another male.
