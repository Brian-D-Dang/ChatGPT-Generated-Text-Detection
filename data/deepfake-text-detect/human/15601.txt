Let me start by saying that I would have given the casino alone a 3.... but unfortunately the casino gets rated with a hotel that I won't stay in again. CASINO... Very elegant, in keeping with the theme. And HUGE. It's pretty much too big; it's easy to get lost inside regardless of the plentiful signage and any cockiness you may have about a sense of direction. There's an excellent selection of restaurants throughout, but nearly all on the extremely expensive side. Also, despite the size of the place, it's somewhat cramped and airless by all the machines, tables, and people crammed inside (and searching for a door...). HOTEL... Slowest. Check in. Ever. The desk had a full complement of staff, but each employee across the board was taking 10-15 minutes per customer. I wondered if this might just be overkill on customer service, or maybe even slow computers (I was ready to give benefit of the doubt), until my turn at the front of my line when I discovered that no, it was just slow staff. Each floor of the hotel is beautiful and airy, especially the central area near the elevators from which the spokes of the hallways radiate. The rooms are.... okay. They're rooms. Simple, but nicely decorated. The pictures on the walls are nicely framed black white photos of stars of stage and screen. (Some are a bit dark and creepy, but most are nice.) But the feel is old. The fixtures are not ageing well, from chipped, scarred, and stained chairs, to chipped, scarred, and stained bathroom fixtures. (I was a little concerned about the toilet.) The beds are beautiful and supremely comfortable, but otherwise I definitely felt let down by the quality I just expected much more. Plus, for a non-smoking floor, there was a constant definite smell of cigarette smoke in my room. Overall does the job as a hotel, but the old-school Tinseltown elegance has definitely faded. With all the other options around, I won't stay here again.
