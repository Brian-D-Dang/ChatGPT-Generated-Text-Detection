Anker has announced a 3D printer that can print five times faster than its competition. The AnkerMake M5 comes with a webcam that can monitor and record prints. It prints the same size parts as other similar 3D printers at a default 250mm per second. The 3D printer is currently on Kickstarter for an early bird price of 499.
