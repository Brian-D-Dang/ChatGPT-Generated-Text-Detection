"All aboard" the hatch shut, I was on my way Lifting for one last time at the break of day I figured I earned it, this one way ticket gone Never to see the place that I called home She took it, I took her I looked her in the eye as she made up some story, and told me another lie Id taken a cold look, when it was said and done cleaned up, broke up, and got rid of the of the gun it was nothing, just a moment that tore my life in two and now im shipwrecked among an outlaw crew sent out on a long ship with some androids and a lab going to re-create all the old things that we had im sleeping in cold sleep as the voices chatter round its the last thing, I remember before the ships touch down been such a long time, but just a clutch of days broken, and divided, from all of my old ways I notice, a new dawn, rising in the east ive never seen one quite like but it brings me some short peace then we're unloaded and kicked out, our gear on our backs, sent forth to reap life and maybe just give back to the race that we've stole from, who sent us out to die expendable creations lost now to the night red rocks, and red sand, and track marks in the dirt lead us, in slow time, to this new kind of earth the curve of the domeland starts over the ridge a gaggle of killers finding new ways to live I think back, to the last time, I looked upon her face I think of the red trails, I drug out of her place the blue strobe, and the bright lights and the feeling of something not quite right the mistake, that I made when I found out about that other guy..... a cosmos, that beckons, I thought could be my train over the last wall and I'll never be seen again....
