So my male friends found out about this, and called me a stalker, creep, ect, but I find nothing wrong with this. They are not underaged, they are fully clothed in EVERY picture, I do not EVER harass the women in question for more pictures, nor do I comment on the pictures at all, and I do not share them on the internet. I find it to be in the same ballpark as downloading pictures of attractive celebrities and using them for the same purpose. I know one argument would be "How would you feel if someone wacked it to pictures of YOU without your permission?" I would be completely fine with this, as long as the pictures are not shared or modified through the internet. I am still convinced that there is nothing wrong about this, so please if you could, give me another view point on this? EDIT: I should say my "female FACEBOOK friends," as some of them I have never talked to or met in my life EDIT 2: Wow guys. Lots of good viewpoints here. I think i will stop using the pictures of my friends and classmates, but continue to use the pictures of women who live in different counties that I will never meet.
