" Good evening, sir, I'm Mr. Carter and this is Mr. Williams. We're here to talk to you about a very urgent matter. " " Is everything alright? " " That depends. Have you heard about Jesus? " " Jesus? No..... No, well, there was a Jesus who used to do some yardwork for the old couple across the street. Oh, and there's a Jason that lives on the next block, but he's an accountant. " " No, sir. We're here about a matter of life and death. Jesus, the Commander and Captain of the Host. " " Oh, God! " " Exactly, sir. " " Can you, can you tell me what he's done? " " His first miracle was to change water into wine. " " That doesn't seem too bad, I mean, that's not illegal, is it? Because I brew my own beer. " " No, sir, this was spontaneous! In the blink of an eye, barrels of water were turned to alcohol. " " Oh, wow. Drugs, eh? I saw Breaking Bad, what chemists can do these days is just astounding. Isn't that more of a DEA thing? Is the Host a gang? I heard about Bob next door getting broken into last night and I just knew it was those junkies I heard about on TV, cos no-one round here would do something like that. Just terrible. " ....." We're here to ask you if you want to let Jesus into your life. " " You mean, like, undercover work? I'm not sure I've got the training, I'm not sure I'm ready for that, but I'd love to help. " " Thank you, sir. I have a pamphlet you might find very interesting. " " Great! Cos I've always known I'd be good at this. I love Law and Order, and CSI. I always know who the murderer is before they do! Yeah, OK, I'll do it. I'll find Jesus for you. "
