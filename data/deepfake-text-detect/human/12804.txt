The hooded man polished off his glass of whiskey and set the tumbler down among the sea of empty bottles littering the floor around him. The Believer couldn't tell if the words had registered until the man removed his cowl. The face underneath brimmed with youth and vitality, but the eyes... Those were the eyes of a madman. " I'm no hero. " " Of course you are, " the Believer began. " You can't die! " " So you think immortality saves lives? " A chuckle escaped the drunk man's lips. " You think that, just because I've been given eternal life, everyone I try to help is immune as well? A fool's belief. " The Believer bristled at the insult. " How much of a hero are you, if all you've managed to save is yourself? " " You think I haven't tried? " The unmasked man leaned forward, elbows resting on knees, and stared at his accuser. " Oh, I've tried so very, very hard to save them. Every soul in danger, every person in peril, and it all ends up the same. Immortality doesn't translate. " I've stepped in front of countless gun barrels, pointed at cowering innocents, knowing full well the discharge can't harm me. The bullets find their targets anyway; a bad ricochet usually does the trick. I've leapt off dozens of buildings, always reaching them just in time, but the impact still gets each and every one. I watched an entire flight disintegrate from the inside out, knowing I'd be the only one to step from the smoldering wreckage. " The immortal rose, staring down the critic. " Heroes save lives. That's where you've gotten it all wrong. This isn't a gift. If I could save just one of them and give myself instead... " He choked back a sob. " I have to watch. The silent sentinel saves no one. " The sentinel stumbled out of the room, leaving the Believer to his freshly shattered world.
