I fully believe that the world would be a better place if the only people who had children were the ones who truly wanted them. It seems that there's such a negative stigma about not wanting to have children - like suddenly it turns you into an uncaring monster or a cruel person who hates children - it's simply not true. I don't hate children, I don't dislike children, I enjoy children in many situations, but they are simply not for me. I don't believe that it's possible to be "selfish" towards a non-existent being - the idea that those who choose not to have children are "depriving" a being of existence is nonsensical. There's such an emphasis on having children that it's unthinkable not to - I can't tell you how many times I and people like me have been told "you'll change your mind" or "just wait, you'll see" - it's so strange that people who are 18 who decide to have children are seen as adults who made the decision, yet even women in their forties who decided not to are still chastised and told that they're not old enough or experienced enough to make that personal decision for themselves. If anything, I believe it's selfish to cajole and pester other people into following the same life route that you did - so many people with children see childfree people as their "projects" to "fix" by "teaching" them the better way to live. The true selfishness is not allowing others to live their life as they choose, not in choosing a different path.
