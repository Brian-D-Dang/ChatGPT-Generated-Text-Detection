The Buffet Rule states that people making more than 1 million dollars per year should have an income tax of at least 30 percent. I agree with this rule for a number of reasons: 1. Happiness due to wealth in logarithmic. This means that when the basic needs for survival are met, happiness with the continual addition of money will have less of an effect on overall happiness. 2. If tax revenue is held constant, that would imply a lower tax rate for the poor. This would improve social class mobility. It would help the working class get by, and offer more of an opportunity for them to remove their focus on having only the essentials. 3. 700k is plenty of money. It is enough to buy a nice house and car, so it is not so different from a 1 million life style. However, a 100k lifestyle is noticeably different than a 70k lifestyle. Hello, users of CMV!
