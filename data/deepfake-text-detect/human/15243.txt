First to state I was really disappointed with my experience at circus circus in general. But me and my brother were so tired by the time we got to the hotel that making the effort of going out to eat any where else didn't seem worth is. As for cheap yeah I guess so but simply adding a beer made the meal about 30 per person which didn't feel that cheap at all. The food all tasted and looked like it had been frozen and the decor was more school cafeteria then vacation. The only nice thing I can say is that the staff were very nice. And if you had very picky children I guess there could be appeal. But other then that save your money if you want to eat mediocre food and go to mcdonalds.
