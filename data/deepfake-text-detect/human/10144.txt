First time CMVer, but hear me out. Reddit's comment system creates hivemind tendencies. It does this in two steps: a) Creates a system were downvotes are accepted And b) Forces redditors to deal with consequences if they are downvoted. This creates a system, where, if you disagree with someone, you can downvote them. This also means that going against the hivemind will net you downvotes, resulting in people who spout popular opinions being the only ones who can do anything. Ex: rmovies does a thread about LOTR. You say you didn't enjoy it. You get downvotes and aren't allowed to speak in rmovies until you wait ten minutes.
