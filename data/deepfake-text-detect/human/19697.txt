Among other ways of meat consumption, steaks are unique in that the pretty much only ingredient is the highest quality beef. It's made from the finest cuts of meat a cow has to offer, often from special cattle breeds. In many countries, good steaks are rather expensive. There IS, however, a correct way a steak should look like so that all the unigue properties of the fine meat are cherished and can be fully appreciated. A good steak is enjoyed by all senses, it should be tender, juicy and red. If someone cannot appreciate it the way it's supposed to be, I understand, but it gives them no right to ruin the quality meat by having it "well-done" just because "they like it that way." First of all, it is a moral crime against the cow itself, if it's selectively bred, delicate meat is turned to ashes and it is offensive to the people who value the meat for everything it has to offer. There is no unique experience from eating a dry, well-done steak that you wouldn't get from a burned pork cutlet. Just as you wouldn't go to a Italian restaurant and ask for overcooked pasta because "you like it that way," you wouldn't ask for a well-done steak. EDIT: I didn't mention any actual chicken, sorry about that, just think of it as "something else" EDIT2: I suppose I had food-fascist upbringing. I understand some of the arguments now, and while I guess I'll never be a food liberal, thank you all for joining in:) Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
