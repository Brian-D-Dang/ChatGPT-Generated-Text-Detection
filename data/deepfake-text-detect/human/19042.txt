Those who have gone through a psychedelic experience know that those moments are hard, if not impossible to put into words, and any attempt to convey their experience to others doesn't make any justice to what they had really felt and saw and thought. During a full blown trip one surpasses all the borders of any mundane experience. All the guys that had their first experience admitted that it had been something absolutely different from what they had ever imagined before. Still, there are people who didn't try it but still make assumptions, speculations and look like they understand what would happen if they did it. So, is there any way for a guy who didn't go through a psychedelic experience to understand what is it like?
