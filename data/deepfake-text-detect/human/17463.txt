Countries today are spending billions of dollars trying to overtake each other in the Space Race, and other developments that are not actually beneficial to Citizens. All right, they might be helpful in the Future, but most of these Developments aren't really useful, other than to flaunt the development power of Countries. I say let us abandon these things. Let us abandon the pursuits which don't benefit us in some way. You want innovation? Leave it to the Private Companiies. SpaceX and Virgin Galactic have been able to do with limited funding what NASA couldn't do with a much bigger government-backed budget. Let us put the Government money to better use, that actually benefit Citizens. And what things may we be talking about? Spend billions on improving a Country's Living Standards, Education, etc. Take India, which recently launched onto Mars. Much of the Country's population is under poverty, and many are not educated. Shouldn't India be focusing on improving these things, rather than flaunting its development abilities to the world? I am just shooting in the dark here. Better Education, better living standards is a given. What more? It is upto the limits of our imagination. A minimum Salary supplied by Government? Subsidized Consumer Products? Anything is possible, really, if we abandon this race to one up each other and focus on the things that really matter.
