My view boils down to this. Why do we work? We work because we need to buy clothes and food and shelter and warmth and other such things. These things require money. We don't work because it's fun or satisfying on a deep personal level or from dedication to our trade. (with some exceptions) We work because without working we will be hungry and cold and wet on the streets. We work to get money to buy comforts and necessities. If we did not need to work, we wouldn't. Simple as that. In nations like India and China it's no different. The children work to buy clothes and food and fuel to stay warm, because they lack family, money, resources and social assistance they must go and earn. Yes it's bad BUT if you stop those children from going out and earning money for fuel and food and clothes they will be hungry and cold and homeless. It's an unfortunate tradeoff but it's better to allow them to work so they can actually have some of the necessities of life. Earning SOME wages to afford firewood, water, and rice is better than earning NOTHING and starving on the street. Banning child labor will not help these children, it will just force them into worse circumstances.
