You need to be more specific, what kind of fasting are you referring to and how long? Intermittent fasting is reasonably safe for something like 168 because it makes logical sense that a human body doesn't get its supply of food for a day or two, that's how it was before we figured out how to make food consistently and not have to hunt for it. Our bodies are built for survival and stressful environments (such as fasting), it's this type of 247 society with desk jobs that's killing us faster than fasting. As we go longer without food, the body tunes us up, makes us more alert via various hormones it has in order to "motivate" us to find food sooner. The longer the body is stressed like this, the more tired you'll start to get and eventually, you'll run out of energy and the body will start to eat itself.','Check out a BBC documentary called: "Eat, Fast and live longer" Very informative and will do a much better job of the science than I could here. Summary: 1-2 days of fasting (or extreme calorie reduction) per week is exceptionally good for health, weight control and mental performance.
