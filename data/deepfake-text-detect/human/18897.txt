I've had windows 8 on my gaming laptop for months now, and I haven't had any problems with it. Recently after telling someone I have it they acted as if I was an idiot for using it. His main argument was "it was designed for touch screen," but I don't see why this makes the operating system poor. Another grief people have with it is the lack of a start button, but there's a command that brings up a basic version of it. All in all it seems faster and more efficient than windows 7 to me, and I believe that all the hate is a result of people hopping on the "windows 8 is bad" bandwagon.
