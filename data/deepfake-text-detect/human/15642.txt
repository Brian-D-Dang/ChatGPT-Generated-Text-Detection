I have been here multiple times before and thought it was pretty good. Over time I have noticed a slight slip in quality of the food. This last trip for lunch sealed the deal for me and I will not be back. The first floor was about 13 full so it was not too crowded. We were a party of 4. Two ordered burgers and two ordered ribs. One ordered an appetizer that came with the meal instead of before the meal. The worst part was that it took 50 minutes to get our food and once it arrived for two of the people, it took 5 more minutes for the other 2 to get their food. The burgers were tasty as was the cornbread. The ribs were way overcooked and dry and had a slightly burnt taste. My guess is that they were cooked significantly earlier and then reheated on a grill. My collard greens were tough and too salty to eat. Not once during our wait did anyone come by and let us know that the kitchen was behind. No one ever asked how our food was after the wait. There are significantly better places to get BBQ than here.
