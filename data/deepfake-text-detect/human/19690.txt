I'm not sure if this has been written about considered previously - please let me know if it has. Most people seem to be focusing on how the NSA's actions violate the 4th Amendment. I am imagining and speculating about future problems down the road that could totally change the country forever in a very short time period. The NSA now has so much information on all of us that the director of the NSA could potentially blackmail or strategically seize power, kind of like Vladimir Putin in Russia. From my understanding Vladimir Putin worked in the KGB for many years and had lots of friends and connections which ended up helping him in politics due to the amount of information they held. According to this article - the NSA has information on all of us...they know all of the sites we visit, they have a file with all of our writings based upon our IP history. They are probably adding this post into my file and marking me as a "threat level yellow," or something like that right now. They have all of your porn viewing habits on file. They have detailed and massive amounts of demographic information on everybody, across the world. It would be an internet marketer's dream to access their files. Whoever has had as much access to that much information about everybody I see as a potentially very dangerous individual for the future of democracy. I don't want to become one of those "Wake up sheeple," guys on the internet. But I can't really think of why any of the above wouldn't be true? Please change my view.
