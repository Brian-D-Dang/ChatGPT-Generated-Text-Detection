Many men argue over whether boxers or briefs are better, but for at least a few years I have been wearing both at once, by which I mean I put on briefs and then wear boxers over them before putting on jeans or whatever pants I may be wearing. Why you may ask? Well, I have issues with briefs and with boxers that are solved by wearing both, which I will tabulate for you: Bonus Boxers Briefs Both Prevents Balls Sticking to Leg X Cushions leg from sharp items in pocket X Prevents accidentally exposing dick X X Acceptable to be seen in by friends X Hides random boners X With boxers and briefs, one can be worn as an impromptu swimsuit and the other can be changed into when done swimming It provides more modesty than either so I feel comfortable changing in public Lower cotton-on-cotton friction coefficient helps prevent accidental wedgies Nobody seems to wear both like I do, though, so maybe my views are skewed. Just thought I would put it out there and see if anything changes my mind. EDIT: I have decided to re-visit boxer briefs and will report back. Thanks for your input.
