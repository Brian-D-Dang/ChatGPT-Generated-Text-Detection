Your eye has more high-detail color receptors in the center and more low-detail black-and-white receptors around the edge. The black-and-white receptors work better in low light, so if you don't look directly at the object you get the image on the fuzzier but more sensitive part of your retina.," "There are two types of light detecting cells on your retina. Cones detect color; rods mainly detect light intensity, i.e. how bright something is, and are better at detecting low levels of light. (This is why it's difficult to tell the colors of things when it's dark.) Cones are more concentrated in the center of the retina, and rods are more concentrated toward the outside. In fact, there is a small spot right in the center of the retina that is all cones and no rods. Thus with adequate lighting, you might see something quite clearly looking at it straight on, but have difficulty telling its color in your peripheral vision (try it). With very dim lighting, of course, your rods will be providing most of your sight. For fun, go outside tonight and locate a dim starlikely you will not be able to see it by looking directly at it, but just off to the side instead. Source: my memory and wikipedia (Edited for clarity and formatting),We have 2 kinds of cells in our eyes that receive light signals: Rods and Cones. Cones are sensitive to different colors, provide more detail, and are concentrated in the center of our eyes. Rods are sensitive to light and dark (black and white), not color, but they are more sensitive to light in general than cones. They are concentrated in the peripheral areas of our eyes. You have a lot more rods than cones in your eyes, as well. So, you see a lot better in your peripheral vision, in black and white, as far as detecting objects, but the detail is a lot less than your center vision when the light is good.
