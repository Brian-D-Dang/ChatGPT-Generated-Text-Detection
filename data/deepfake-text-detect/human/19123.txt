When I say narcotics I am excluding Marijuana, some people consider it a narcotic, others don't. As far as I can see drugs such as heroin cannot just be used recreationally for the most part, and it is extremely hard to stop using. Similar things could be said about crystal meth and crack, even cocaine. If there is a demand there will always be a supply. So I agree with doing everything possible to create large drug busts. So here I am. I would love to see these hard drugs off the streets, as if it were legal for everyone I think it would create problems. However, I see places where drugs are legal, and it seems to work for them, so my mind is open for change. CMV! Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
