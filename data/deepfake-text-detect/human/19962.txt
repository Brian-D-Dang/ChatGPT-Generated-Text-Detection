Awhile back there was a local judge who imposed novel sentences like public shaming (in addition to parole) on non-violent defendants rather than locking them up in prison. The convicted had to wear signs stating their crime like shoplifting outside the place they stole from for a certain period of time. I think it was less than a week. Critics didn't like this form of punishment and tried to get the sentences overturned based on the constitutional claim of cruel and unusual punishment. I disagree. Society should have a way to enact such punishments that are cost-effective and promote awareness of the crime and to deter such offenses in the future. I'd think that a visible, but short punishment is better than an invisible, but lengthy one in prison. N.B., I am not advocating physical public humiliation like caning (i.e., Singapore)
