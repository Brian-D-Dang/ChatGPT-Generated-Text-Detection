It might just be a string of bad luck but over the years when I go on vacation, visit family, whatever the case may be I'm always harassed by the airport security. I go to the airport on average like 4 times per year and every single time I'm somehow always chosen for random screenings. I happen to be a mix of Costa Rican and Egyptian so I have an olive complexion so I look sort of arab. I feel so embarrassed and uncomfortable when they frisk me. I absolutely hate strangers touching me. I'm a law biding American citizen and I don't deserve this bullshit treatment. Just because someone looks arab doesn't make them a terrorist! I'm on my last nerve and if they so much as pick me for a random screening again I will sue the shit out of the airlines!
