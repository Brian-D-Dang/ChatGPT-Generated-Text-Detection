Almost all Coors Light advertising has to do with their beer being nice and cold. Examples are the [famous train ads] as well as showing [other means of delivering their beer] nice and cold. It's all idiotic because the temperature of the beer has nothing to do with quality - IT JUST MEANS YOU'RE PUTTING IT IN YOU'RE DAMN REFRIGERATOR. You also hear them call it "frost brewed" - but [judging by the posts] in a brewing forum it's just a fancy way to say lagered. Now to clarify: I don't drink beer and I know that advertising isn't always supposed to be super accurate, but anyone who drinks beer should see how stupid this is! It may not be stupid in getting people thirsty for beer but it's logic is so dumb it should not attract people right? Maybe I'm missing something because NO ONE has ever mentioned to me how stupid those ads are and, after all, I don't drink. So CMV. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
