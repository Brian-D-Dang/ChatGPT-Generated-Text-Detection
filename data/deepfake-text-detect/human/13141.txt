We stood, shivering, huddled around the whiteboard. Our standup meetings were a huge risk, but what resistance could manage without them? Jim went around the circle, asking everyone what they'd been working on. We hadn't had a working computer this week, so it was a very short list. Jim got to me. Jim, everyone. I've been working on our framework. It's a key deliverable for this week. Without a computer, I've been..... I couldn't work out how to finish the sentence and tailed off. The Code Patrol had confiscated all the "non-approved" computers they could find a few years before, under the guise of "security." There were still a few free machines around, cobbled together from old carcasses, but we'd lost our working server - along with two of our best coders - thanks to a random house search. Random..... yeah right. Everyone knew they were analysing our digital footprints. That was half the battle, trying to look normal online. Jim carried on, finishing with Laura, the - let's be honest - token female developer. Hi Jim. I've found a way in. Howls of laughter erupted and were instantly hushed. The Code Patrol weren't quick or even terribly alert, but if they caught you..... Jim replied as the laughter died down. You've found a way in? A way to deploy our code onto the internet? Sure you have. Laura shot him an indignant look, and pulled something out of her bag. Eyes widened and I felt a cold sweat form instantly on my face. Laura..... where did you get that? How long have you had it? Is that..... an Android? Androids were the first machines to go. Too open, too free, too uncontrollable. Every since Google had bought Apple and instantly bricked every Android, there had been rumours of a few still circulating. Nobody really believed them, but everybody hoped. Laura looked around the group, the look in her eyes made it clear she knew the impact of her revelation. This..... is my Pixel.
