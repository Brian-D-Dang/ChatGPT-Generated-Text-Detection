[an image] for reference. for bicyclists, a left turn is signaled by extending their left arm straight to the left. a right turn can be signaled by bending the left arm up, or extending the right arm straight to the right. in the US, where i live, both signals are legal. i think "right arm out" is a better signal, but i don't mind other people preferring "left arm up." for some people, this is apparently a controversial opinion; i've been told that "left arm up" is standard, correct, or better in some way, and i should change my signal gestures. i think "right arm out" is better; it's intuitiveyou're pointing in the direction you're going. it's easy to learn and hard to confuse. change my view!
