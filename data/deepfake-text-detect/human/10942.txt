The commercial that gets skipped to is usually inserted by the local station. The station is given a list of timeslots for commercials and they program their video switcher playback system to switch to the local commercial at the appropriate time. Somewhere along the way, though, there may be a clock that's not quite synchronized or someone didn't tag a commercial with the exact right length, or in some older systems, someone has to push the "take" button on the router manually at the right time.
