150 years ago, life expectancy was [way lower] and child mortality was [a lot higher] . Most people had to perform physically intensive work as farmers. This means that most women in the past had to be continuously pregnant, and they had to care for a lot of children: most babies would not become adults. They also had to do things like making clothes. Since then, progress in technology and medicine has changed a lot. You don't need to give birth to five or six children. You don't have to expect to die at age 40. We buy our clothes in stores instead of making them ourselves. We have freezers, (dish) washers and dryers. We don't need to perform physically intensive work on the field or in the factory; most of us work in the [service sector] . These drastic changes obviously affect the lives of women. They have to lead a different life than they did in 1850. But this is not because they were freed from oppression by the patriarchy - this is because our society has changed more between 1850 and now then it has between [1850 and the Dark Ages] . Men and women aren't equal. Pre-industrial gender roles are generally the same in all cultures; men perform physically intensive work, they are soldiers and politicians, while women generally work in and around the house and raise the children. This isn't merely the result of the fact that men have more muscles while women can become pregnant, it's also the result of [psychological differences] . Gender roles have to change because our society has changed and is changing quickly, meaning older gender roles are outdated. Culture has to adapt to technological and scientific progress. But it's not a "road from patriarchy to equality." Men and women aren't equal and past gender roles were mainly the result of practical necessity, not oppression. CMV.
