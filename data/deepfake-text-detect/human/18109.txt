I use a lot of energy every day to power my computer, boil my kettle, charge my phone, have artificial light, cook food and so on. I don't watch TV, but that is only a small relief. I am learning to drive. Most people expect that for the majority of their lives they will own a car, possibly two. There are over a billion cars on the planet and more people to own more cars are being born every second. Even though I cannot drive I am regularly driven places and I fly at least once a year, if not twice or three times. I do not grow my food. I buy it from supermarkets because there are no independent grocers near where I live. It's wrapped in plastic. I shower every day, using lots of water and energy. I order things online. They are wrapped in materials, transported via energy using vehicles, sometimes hundreds of miles, to me. I use lots of paper every day. Making notes, doing work, printing. I own a fair amount of clothes that I wash continually. I also do lots of sport, so my sport kit is always being washed. This all takes energy. Even the fact that I don't eat meat does not seem to amount to much. I just buy a different kind of thing wrapped in plastic, with the same food miles on it. This lifestyle is not at all extraordinary; it is very ordinary. I believe that this is not at all sustainable, but most people live it. How could this not be a crisis?
