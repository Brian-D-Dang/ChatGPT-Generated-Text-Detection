When I was a child, I wanted to do some work so I could buy more candy or whatever. I don't know how old I was, perhaps 8-12? I remember that I once cut my neighbors lawn and got a little money for it. As long as everything is voluntary and there is no kind of forceabuseslavery involved, I see no problem with child labor. If the child belongs to a very poor family and needs to work in order to support the family, then I see a problem. But that's not the context I want to discuss here. Imagine an economically stable family in a first world country. One argument against child labor could be that the child should go to school. But it doesn't have to interfere with that, the child could choose to work a few hours in the evening or on weekends. And even if we ignore the school argument altogether, a typical nine-to-five job is too exhausting for a child in the same way that an adult shouldn't work 12 hours per day. But that doesn't mean that working in itself is bad in any way. If a child has a job, the working conditions should be suited for children just like working conditions of regular jobs are suited for adults. There are of course many kinds of jobs that are not appropriate for children. But what's the problem with a child choosing to go out for walks with other peoples dogs for a few hours each weekend and earn a little money for it?
