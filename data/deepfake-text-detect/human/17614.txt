I know that that view is racist and that AAVE is a legitimate dialect that deserves respect, but the racist in me needs more convincing in order to thoroughly shake her belief. Late edit: A delta worthy comment would change one or both of my two opinions stated above, so you would have to either convince me that AAVE is not a legitimate dialect deserving of respect or that it is not inferior to standard American English and that it very much has a right to exist and so should go on existing. Edit 2: See [here] for my conclusion. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
