So one of the biggest criticisms of the show Girls is that the show has no POC characters. While I will concede the use of Donald Glover last season was a misfire (he played a black republican), I can't say I'm too bothered by it other than that. So why am I not bothered? It's not because I hate POC or that I don't think they deserve to have their stories told, but I don't think this would be an appropriate place for those stories. It's because it seems ridiculous that the characters in this show would have minority friends, that's the point. Hannah's the kind of person who likes to act more accepting than everyone else, but the people she knows and interacts with daily are very homogenous, and it's good characterization. If she suddenly had a diverse friend group and and that wasn't an issue or cause of drama, that would be bad characterization. The only way I can see a minority character working would be in a situation where Hannah made a new "friend" who was a POC and tried to act super cool and supportive, but she was actually objectifying the person because of their race instead of seeing them as a human being. Also, she'd have to be called on her shit (sort of like what happened with Donald Glover). But apart from that, I can't see any situation where a POC would ever want to be friends with Hannah. I think people get caught up in the idea that Hannah (and her friends) are meant to be "good" people, or an accurate portrayal of all women. Hannah isn't the feminist ideal (nor is she the antichrist). She's just a fucked up and deeply flawed person, and that's what makes her interesting. ETA: I think it could work if they were tertiary characters or acquaintances, but I don't see Hannah as the kind of person who would have a lot of black friends. Also, Jessica Williams from the Daily Show was recently on the show as a coworker of Hannah's.
