Am I still dreaming? The feeling felt different than before. I was about to hit the ground when the feeling changed, if only so slightly. I had fallen out of my attic window. I felt the small amount of wind resistance causing a small chill on my back. Now there was no wind on my back or feeling of any kind anywhere. I only felt like I was falling. My eyes were still shut as they were when I was pushed out my attic. I opened them for the first time in what felt like a long while. I saw the ceiling of my room. The ceiling remained at the same distance even though I felt like I was decending some hole in my bed. In fact I wasn't even fully sure I was in my bed. I moved my eyes down and saw my sheets. I began to turn my head to investigate the rest of my surroundings. I heard the crumple of my cheap pillows. I saw the bed maintaining my body. But when I turned my head it felt as though I hadn't. No response from the pillow shifting my hair was felt. I couldn't feel the warmth of my blankets. I couldn't feel my jaw widen. I heard myself scream in fear. I couldn't feel a thing. I just felt like I was falling. (kinda my first go at one of these. Not much of a writer just thought I'd give it a try.: P)
