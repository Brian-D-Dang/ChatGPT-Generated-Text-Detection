I was disappointed when I came here! I came here because we wanted some food after a long night and somewhere close! We were staying at the venetian and we also wanted something not too pricey as well! We came here and all their dishes were around 20 or so. I got the vodka pasta which was ok. Nothing great. The boyfriend got the pizza which was way too cheesy! I don't think I'd be returning to this place in the future.
