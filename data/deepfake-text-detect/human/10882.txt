Popcorn kernels contain small amounts of water, and that water evaporates when heated, expands, and pops the popcorn. Due to variation in the water content of the kernels along with size, and even strength, it takes different times for different kernels. Imagine that we have two kernels, one strong, one weak. The weak kernel will take less time to pop, due to requiring less force, which can be generated in a shorter amount of time.', "Kernels pop when the water inside heats up and expands. Kernels that don't pop don't have enough water inside for the pressure to build up. That's why they pop. Some take a shorter or longer time, depending on how much water they have.
