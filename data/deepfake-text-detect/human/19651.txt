I hear a lot of how teachers should be paid more, but based on the amount of time they have off they seem to be adequately compensated. Teacher get just shy of 3 months off per year. They have average starting pay of 35k, and average pay of about 50k. This translates to starting pay of 47k and an average pay of 66k. They also have the job security of a government job. This is all of public teacher, private education is a different situation. It just seems as though they get paid enough.
