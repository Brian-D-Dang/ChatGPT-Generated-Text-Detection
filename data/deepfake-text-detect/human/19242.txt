America has been known to be the country that is the definition of democracy over the last few centuries. I believe that is untrue due to the fact ever since the civil war, different political parties have had their candidates elected. Political parties have risen and fallen and now two major parties remain: Republicans and Democrats. These two major parties are the only parties that are even looked at by mainstream news media, and also are the only two parties that receive enough votes to be considered viable candidates for presidency. Not only that but there are specific debates and events exclusive to both Republican and Democratic candidates. Congress is also filled with both parties and all of our decisions come from both of these parties. As long as our current system lasts in America it will never be a Democracy. CMV
