The short answer is that they don't. Hell in many states you can decline a field sobriety test as they are not mandatory.," "It isn't. The purpose of a field sobriety test is to see if the officer wants to bother moving forward with a breathalyzer andor blood test. If the field test is not possible, they can just move along to the next tests if they suspect you are drunk.," "The first component of SFST's is called Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus. It's to determine the coordination of your eyes and doesn't require anything other than that you have vision and don't have a few medical conditions that might interfere with the test. Alcohol will impair larger muscle groups the more you drink. Conversely it impairs finer muscles without having drank a lot. You know when you've about four drinks in and your face gets numb, then the more you drink you notice your hands get numb and lose coordination until eventually your legs won't even carry you? Well, having drank just a little impairs the very fine muscles that control the movement of your eyes. That's what cops are looking for when they test for nystagmus. Nystagmus is basically a jittering in the eye caused by those very find muscles losing coordination. This happens because finer muscles lose coordination first when you're impaired by alcohol. Other than that there are other tests outside of SFST's that courts may or may not allow as evidence. Such as reciting the alphabet or touching the fingers of one hand together in a specific pattern. Other evidence is always considered. How the person was driving, odor of alcohol, breathalyzer or intoxilyzer, ect. SFST's are only a small part of the evidence used to convict someone of DUI.
