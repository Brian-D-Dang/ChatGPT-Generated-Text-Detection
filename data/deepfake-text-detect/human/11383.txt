Scientists were able to use light and bio-ink to print a human ear-like structure under the skin of mice without a single surgical cut. Digital light processing-based 3D bioprinting is a process where cell-containing bio-ink is injected into injured tissue and then stimulated with patterns of light. The light activates the cells in the bio-ink. Depending on the cell type, this technique can be used to repair damaged spinal cords, nerve fibers, or blood vessels. Using near-infrared light, this technique opens up the possibility of performing 3D tissue engineering without the need for surgery, directly inside the patient. It may be possible to create implants without the risk of infection. The technique can also be used to heal severe wounds.
