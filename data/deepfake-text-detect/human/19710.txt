I've had a discussion with my SO lately about children and the fact that they are no longer necessary for ones personal survival. With all the social well fare (at least here in Sweden) there is no need for me as an individual to have children. Of course I understand this can't apply to society as a whole as we need people but I don't personally need any one to take care of me when I am old as it used to be. If it is a non necessary and an active choice which it most often is then I see that it is something you want to do with your spare time. Even if it is a full time hobby it is still something you chose to do and wouldn't shorten your life span. I'm sorry for eventual spellinggrammar me being a swed and on a phone.
