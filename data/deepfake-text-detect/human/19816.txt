I believe this is the purpose of the term "African-American," to move towards a time when ethnic groups, defined by a common ancestral, social, cultural, or national experience, replace the whole concept of race. Unfortunately, we are still haunted by racialism. Americans continue to categorize people by the unscientific term "race" in our laws, our census, and our speech. Even among people who consider themselves progressive, this gives undue credibility to the whole notion of race. I understand the change won't happen overnight, but I think we should gradually recognize this distinction in our laws and census and official documents, and eventually in our speech. Classifying people based on "race" should be no more credible than classifying them based on the bumps on their heads. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
