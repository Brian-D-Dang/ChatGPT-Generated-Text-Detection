I am new to the Phoenix area,and really didn't know where to go for a haircut and color. I decided to give the Paul Mitchell Beauty School a try. I have been there twice now and just love Stephanie. Stephanie is a phase 2 student, she is going to go far in this business!! She is very good and does a great job at cutting my hair and coloring it. I hope to be able to follow her once she graduates from the school here in a couple of months!!!! I would totally recommend going here for a color and haircut. Thank you Stephanie!! You are going to be awesome!!!!
