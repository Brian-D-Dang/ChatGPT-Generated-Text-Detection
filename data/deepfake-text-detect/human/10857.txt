My understanding is that problems often arise when a background process gets stuck in an infinite loop. If this happens, restarting can stop the loop, and allow everything to start running properly and hopefully not get stuck again. There're probably other problems also solved by restarting, but I'm only familiar with the infinite loop problem.','It restarts the processes going on, maybe the problem is a conflict between processes, and restarting the pc makes it so both processes can be executed properly
