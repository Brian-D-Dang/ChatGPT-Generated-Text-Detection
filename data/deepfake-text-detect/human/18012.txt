First of all, lets get something out of the way. By pluralism, I mean the western idea that we should respect and tolerate other points of view. For example, take a look at islamist extremists. The majority of the american public believes that we should storm in and remove the taliban from power. While that is a nice idea, we can't impose it on others without becoming hypocrites. The very idea of pluralism states that we can't impose it on others. By imposing it on other cultures, we effectively create the 'one correct culture' that we tried to avoid in the first place. We need to remember that Pluralism is just another idea. Every culture has believed that they have the moral right. Imagine I say to you 'I have a philosophy. If you follow it, it will end well for everyone. Oh, by the way, if you disagree, we will come in and impose our culture upon you.' EDIT: Response to all commenters. All of your arguments seem to assume that your personal code of morals is the right one. Pluralism challenges us to not automatically assume our belief code is correct .
