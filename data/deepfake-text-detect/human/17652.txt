I think that loads of people put shit on him but if he is compared to previous presidents he is better. He is a better ambassador and he holds himself well in the international atmosphere. George Bush was a significant wanker that brought about the War on Terror and caused complete turmoil in numerous countries in the middle east. I know that Obama is not a perfect human being, but tell my why he is so bad that everyone feels he should not be running the country?
