I'm 27. With the increased automation that destroys jobs and no clear indication of a shift in our economic structure to compensate (big data is fundamentally useless, i.e., creates no real value, or is even counterproductive - it is designed to increase consumerism, which is a cause of most of these problems) and the environmental destruction that is not being adequately addressed, I don't believe any investments I make now will be worth anything in 50 years. I don't see a way the world survives (no violent revolution) without massive increases in social welfare. I'm not convinced that we will be able to provide the water, phosphorous, and nitrogen needed to farm at the scales we do. I'm fully convinced that overfishing and ocean acidification will cause the collapse of those ecosystems that will have massive consequences.
