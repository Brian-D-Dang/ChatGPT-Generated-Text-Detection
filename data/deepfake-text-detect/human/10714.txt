Because of muscle memory. You could tell me the order of keys, but it'd be very difficult to do so. Your brain can know what you want to type, the letters involved and the location of they keys needed to type them without you consciously needing to know the details. This is great because it's fast and requires littleno effort. It's bad if you ever want to try a different keyboard layout because muscle memory takes a good bit of time to retrain.
