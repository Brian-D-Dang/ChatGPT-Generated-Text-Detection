I am not saying all are, there are many with mental or physical health problems, or and extremely bad start in life. However the majority of poor Americans are content, and do not want to have to work, or go to college, or put the time in required to move up in society. I come from a poor family and am in college now, and I feel lazy allot of the time, I almost feel like I am entitled to sit around and play video games all day, but I have to remind myself that the world humans created does not work that way, that we must work for everything we get. I feel that the society we have created has made us soft, people in 3rd world countries work their whole lives to just survive, but we have grown up on video games and easy high school.
