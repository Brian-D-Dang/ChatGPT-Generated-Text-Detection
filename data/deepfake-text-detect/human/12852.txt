Gerard walked into the bar and tried to sit down exactly in the middle. Five stools to the left, four to the right. "Not a good sign," he thought to himself, "I should have planned this out better." A couple employees walked back and forth behind the bar, unpacking boxes of wine bottles and bringing out clean glasses. One of them glanced at Gerard but he didn't seem to notice them. "Ok. Just ask for it. Everyone else does so can you," he told himself. Gerard looked up and stared at the bearded fellow he assumed was a bartender. He wondered if he was being a creep but decided to just stick with it. After all everyone else does it. The bearded fellow caught his stare. "What can I get you?" "Well, I uh..... I'll take a glass of..... of water." "Ok, sure." The bearded fellow grabbed a glass, added a scoop of ice, and filled it up with water. He set it down in front of Gerard on a napkin. "There you go." "How much?" "Water is free," the fellow said. He stood there for a moment to see if Gerard would say anything else, but quickly walked off to the back room when he noticed nothing else was going to be said. This place is nicer than his usual spot, his bedroom. Gerard picked up the glass and held it to his lips. Now he understood what everyone was talking about. Granted he wasn't drinking at any place as extreme as the Taco Bell across from the university or standing on the street corner. This place was much less busy, but it is a start. He tilted the glass back, but a little too far and the cold water spilled out past the gap between the glass and his face. Gerard leaped up and tripped over his own two feet. He fell backward and hit his head on the ground. Unfortunately the injury was too great for Gerard, and he bled out on the bar floor.
