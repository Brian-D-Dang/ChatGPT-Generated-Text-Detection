I think that by campaigning for the use of real names online, Google is ushering in a new era of both online and personal responsibility. It's obvious already; all of the youtube comments I've seen connected to a real name are generally much more respectful, interesting, and positive. Youtube comments have always held a reputation for being of particularly poor quality and taste, and requiring people to use a real name will undoubtably improve that, creating a better online experience for everyone. I also feel that people spend enough time interacting with strangers online that how we do so will affect how we interact with people in the real world (and I think this effect will be especially relevant for younger generations). Giving people the chance to anonymously be assholes to others online will make them feel that they can get away with it in real life. This is bigger than youtube, G, or any set of products. This is a culture-shift on a massive level, and one for the better. However, I do feel that content generators should be allowed to decide if they wish to require commenters to use real names or not. If you want to post a video about things nobody would use their real name to comment on, you should still be able to create a space for them to do so anonymously. Also search should never be linked to personal information, for very obvious reasons. It may seem horrible and awkward while the transition occurs, but once complete, it will be good for Google, the internet, and society in general. Google is perhaps the only company in the world with the power and the influence needed to induce such an enormous shit in the way everyone acts online, and they will drag us into the future whether we want to or not.
