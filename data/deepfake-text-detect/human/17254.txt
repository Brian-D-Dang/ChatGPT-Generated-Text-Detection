Let's begin with the premise of an omnipotent god who is actively involved in the universe. It loves humans and is "just," which is the justification for sending people to hell. However, if he is all powerful AND is engaged in the current world as it happens, it seems like a logical problem for him to not aid in the avoidance of eternal damnation. The only way around this problem I see is for it to be a creator who set the universe in motion and let things happen in accordance to the beginning. This also has some flaws because we could argue that the original motion determines our fate anyways, but it seems like a more defensible argument.
