Within the last, I'd say 5 or so years (or ever since the incarnation of "Toddlers in Tiaras" the world of childhood beauty pageants has become a somewhat controversial issue. Among reddit especially, many people here find them reprehensible and disgusting and whatever other adjectives we feel like using. I think that this hate is completely unjustified, I don't think that entering your child in a beauty pageant is any different than entering them into gymnastics or any other competitive event. I wish I could better formulate my opinion, however, I don't know the exact reasons why so many people find them disgusting, so I'm very open to listening! Please CMV
