An activist investor is one who purchases shares with the intent of utilizing the voting rights of those shares to achieve an agenda. This could be - for example - purchasing shares in WalMart to using your voting power to encourage labor and wage reform. On the extreme end, a wealthy activist investor can use their power to get a board seat and that have a strong and direct influence. Why do companies dislike them? Well...the activist may have an agenda that the company disagrees with. WalMart has a clear strategy that so far has not resulted in wage increases to the degree some might like. So...this activist investor pushes for that change and rocks the boat.
