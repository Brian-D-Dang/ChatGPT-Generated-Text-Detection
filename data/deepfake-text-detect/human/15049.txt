Having had prior experiences at The Nail Room that were entirely positive, I was extremely disappointed when a recent negative experience was met with no attempt to make things better. My daughter and I visited for manipedis, and the nail technician who worked with my daughter was over zealous in working on her big toe. My daughter told her it hurt, but she kept going. The next day the toe was sore, red and inflamed. I contacted The Nail Room and was asked for the technicians name. That was the last I ever heard from them. They made no attempt to follow up, check on my daughter's pain or provide any compensation. As we had had such positive experiences in the past, I expected more. The owner was short with me and made no attempt to fix things. Back to the search for a good nail place, as we will not return to a place with so little concern for their clients.
