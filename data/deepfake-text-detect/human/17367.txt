Symbiosis happens because creatures must choose between energy spent on competing and energy spent on cooperating, because a) you have lots of competitors whom you may not beat, and b) you have to prioritize amongst them so c) some species who are you competing with significantly less than with others may help you incidentally to stay healthy and compete with species with whom you more directly compete. However, the more capable a species becomes to more it takes control of any given symbiotic relationship, and it becomes more a masterslave relationship. Just look at humans and domesticated animals. And even animals that are not domesticated that would compete with us and that which we seek to preserve, a) are not serious competitors, tigers might kill A human, but they are not a threat and b) we preserve them in the spirit of preserving the wider environment which sustains US. So, ultimately, if we could sever our dependence on other species, we would, and we would supplant them, because that's what the basic, fundamental impulse behind life does. If it can, it will do it. But it also understands that it can't undermine its own support systems too much, because it does not have enough control over its own life and the environment that supports it. But that is a practical, strategic decision, that is taken by the basic drive to supplant all else. So, the Dalek impulse, to wipe out all that is not Dalek, is in all of us, and all life, and is completely justified. After all, if all life has it, then how can we argue morally against it.
