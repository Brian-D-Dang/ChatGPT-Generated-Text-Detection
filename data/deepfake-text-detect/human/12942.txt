A distinct and oddly apt thunder shook the cavernous halls of Olympus' main chambers, as Zeus called the council to order. "Now, after many aeons of peace," he began, Hermes translating frantically into English for the newer gods who hadn't learned proper Greek yet, "we have a new duty needed for the Olympians. The humans have created a resource called the internet, a vast network of information accessible from anywhere in the mortal realm!" "It must be mine!" shouted Prometheus, kept as a keepsake now on Zeus' desk. "I gave them their creativity!" "Ya stole it, ya winey bastard!" shouted Hestia, Dionysus wincing in the background. "Rather mine, as it's made of metal and the forge!" grumbled Hephaestus. "What of my beauty and the mortal attempt to imitate the originals?" exclaimed Aphrodite, scrolling through Instagram. A dark shadow rose from the stairs in front of the great hall, a figure approaching. "It belongs to me." stated Hades sadly. "It kills them long before they enter my realm," brandishing a single page of 4chan's infamous b board. Zeus recoiled in shock, for aeons of non-existence and mortal folly could not have prepared him for it. "Burn the globe, even if we go. None of the other gods need to know about this."
