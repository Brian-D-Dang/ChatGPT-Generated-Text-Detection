I get all my prescriptions here, only because its close to my house and also on my way to work, iIt is pretty nasty and worn down in there!!! It's dirty and old, hinky people walking all over the place. I always feel I have to watch my back in there. The customer service is nill. They dont have any type of selection. But, the pharmacy is ok, my meds are always done and ready on time. Other then that this place is just weird. Needs a major make over.
