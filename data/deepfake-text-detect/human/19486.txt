I have tried watching Insidious several times and each time I have found it very mundane. I consider myself knowledgeable of film and I thoroughly enjoy most scary movies. I thought Insidious was boring and not scary in the slightest. rHorror lists it as number 4 in the Top 20 Ghost StoryHaunted House Films. The acting seemed subpar, the story was creative but executed poorly, and some of the scares seemed very forced. Maybe there is some symbolism or central theme I'm missing. I know a lot of people agree and maybe I am just missing something so try and change my view.
