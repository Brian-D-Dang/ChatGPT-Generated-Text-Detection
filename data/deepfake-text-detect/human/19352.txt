So, I've watched all 6 movies, and although there are a few flaws (mildly annoying character, the second movie wasn't great, ect.) I thought the prequel trilogy was just as good as the original one, and the third movie was easily the best of them all. The action scenes were phenomenal, the storyline was coherent and variant, and the acting was, for the most part, pretty good. People always seem to complain about Jar Jar Binks, but he really wasn't that bad... I mean, one minor support character doesn't make or break a movie. I get the feeling that, no matter what movies they released, they would have been hated because they weren't the originals. But taking an honest reflection of the originals, there is a huge flaw that simply makes the movies a little boring, that being that they completely recycled the driving element of the plot for two of the movies. Death Star blows up, build new Death Star, blow up new Death Star. Well, there's my argument, now CMV.
