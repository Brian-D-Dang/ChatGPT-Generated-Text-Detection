I work at a grocery store and too many times have I seen people pay for food with food stamps and then proceed to pay for a 30 pack with cash. Government assistance should be used by those who would otherwise be unable to feed themselves or procure other basic needs. If someone receives benefits then any other income they receive needs to also go to help cover these necessities, not to be spent on what are essentially luxury items while the government pays for your needs. This would be hard to enforce however, one way that would work would be adding a note to a persons ID specifying that they may not alcoholtobacco as a precondition to receiving welfare benefits.
