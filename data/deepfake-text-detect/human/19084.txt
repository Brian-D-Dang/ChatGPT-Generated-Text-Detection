There are many arguments that can go both for and against the practice, primarily revolving around the exploitative nature of the practice in countries such as India. However, this practice does, in a way, empower women of those regions. It pays 10x the salaries they would often make in a year, gives them autonomy and freedom of choice to do what they want of their body. One of the biggest issues I have is that states in America do not view a surrogacy contract as valid. If the surrogate chooses to keep a child they have no genetic relation to, it is their right. Why does the "duress" clause apply? If a woman is being justly compensated, knows the service they are offering, and is receiving adequate healthcare throughout the pregnancy, why is this practice considered unethical? EDIT - CMV of the Day. Cool!
