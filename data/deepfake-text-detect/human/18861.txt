So GMOs (genetically modified organisms) come up for debate and discussion a lot. I'm not trying to argue here whether they're good or bad. But, inevitably, someone says "well, someone bred this tomato at some point, so its genes have been modified, so it's a GMO!" Which doesn't help the discussion at all; it's just being pedantic, and it just stands in the way of useful conversation. It's just like me saying "well, technically, changing the direction of a car accelerates it in a new direction, so the steering wheel is an accelerator. Brakes just cause an acceleration in reverse, so they're accelerators. If I turn on the AC, it draws engine power, which slows the car down, which is an acceleration!" If I tell a mechanic my car is having accelerator problems, and he says "which accelerator?," I know he's not interested in solving the problem, just in being nit picky. If someone says "well, actually, cattle are the product of selective breeding, so they're ALL GMO," I assume they don't want to have a meaningful discussion; they just want to nit pick at words when they know full well what people mean by GMO.
