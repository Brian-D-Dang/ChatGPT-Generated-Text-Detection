Good for what it's good for. A quick bite to eat with lots of options for vegetarians. My daughter was a big fan of the mac cheese. I was more so-so on the Indonesian Peanut Saute. When I mentioned that the edamame was way over cooked (inedible) the response was That's too bad. I do expect more action then sympathy at a restaurant when I indicate a problem. Sigh.
