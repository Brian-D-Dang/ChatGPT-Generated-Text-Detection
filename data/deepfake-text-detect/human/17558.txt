We have domesticated dogs to listen to commands, follow orders, stay in line and protect us. We keep our pets locked up for hours while we go to school, work, or out with friends. All this for our own selfish pleasure of wanting to cuddle and feel loved by a furry friend. Dog may be "man's best friend," but what is man to dog? We let them go outside but not without a wooden fence or leash and even go so far as to setting up an electric fence. Then we buy their love by sneaking them table scraps and giving them treats. It seems to me that we receive more by having dogs as pets than dogs do by being our pets. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
