The atmosphere and ambiance of 1947 was quite good and there is no question that they have an outstanding selection of bourbon. I was also greeted very quickly and cordially from the bartender who took very good care of me. The reason why I am only giving this restaurant two stars is because I thought their food was not up to par. I was very disappointed because I heard from several people who good the food was. The discrepancy does not lie in the taste or quality of the food but in the quantity. I paid 12 for a burger that was smaller than my coaster. I'm sure it was quality beef and it was made well, but when I pay 12 for a burger I expect a 12 burger. I think they should at least disclose on their menu how much you can expecte the burger to weigh. Mine could not have been more than 5 or 6 oz. The fries that accompanied my burger were quite good, but worth 12. This came as a great surprise as the owners own Bites and Brews and Elbow Room, both of which I always have an excellent dining experience.
