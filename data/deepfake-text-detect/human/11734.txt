Elon Musk has laid out how he will fund the 46.5 billion purchase of Twitter. Musk will receive loans from Morgan Stanley worth 25.5 billion and cover the remaining 21 billion with his own funds. While Musk is the richest person on the planet, most of his net worth is tied up in Tesla stock. Twitter has not formally responded to Musk's offer, but the company's board of directors has approved measures to block the hostile takeover.
