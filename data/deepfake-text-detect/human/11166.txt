While the hands are heavy, they are balanced so that there is no up or down. The time accuracy is unaffected by the angle of the hands. The balance is important to minimizing wear on the gears.','They are checked daily and weight is added or removed as needed (most often in the form of one pence coins).', "A lot of it comes from the very long and heavy pendulum, but the best answer is that they don't. They are constantly attended and adjusted. Even the most accurate mechanical marine chronometers don't keep exact time as such, they gain or lose time at a constant rate. So if it's 30 days since the clock was set to correct time, and it's been rated at 1 second a day, you know to deduct 30 seconds from the indicated time to find out the actual time. If you suspend the pendulum in a vacuum at a constant temperature like the old style clocks used for astronomy they are a lot more accurate, but still not perfect.
