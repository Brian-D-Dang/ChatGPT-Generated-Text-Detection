I have come to this conclusion for several reasons. The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past experience alone it is the country most likely to use them again. The main positive effect of atomic weapons, that gets brought up a lot, is mutually assured destruction. The USA dropped 2 atomic bombs, not as retribution to an atomic attack. It demonstrated a lower bar for considering using them. The USA regularly starts new wars. It's certainly the nation among the big superpowers that is most likely to initiate a new war and, in the case of Irak, can not even explain why they went to war in the first place. A country that is this likely to be involved in wars is more likely to find itself in a position where it would consider using another atomic bomb.
