My boyfriend and I came here for lunch on a Monday afternoon and waited for about 45 minutes before being seated. The wait was definitely doable, especially since the hostess takes your phone number and online updates are texted to you informing you how many parties are ahead of you. Once we were seated, our server was quick to take our orders and make us feel welcome. I ordered the LV burger and my boyfriend ordered the ABC burger - both were delicious. Finally, we had our frozen hot chocolate, and this treat alone made the high prices tolerable. This was definitely an awesome experience and is a must-do for people visiting Vegas.
