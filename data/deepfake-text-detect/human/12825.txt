It was on a bench in the park that I first began to suspect it. That she was more than just the love of my life, but rather my..... "Hey. I've been thinking..." "Oh? About what?" "Do you think we're..... soul mates?" She sat in silence for a while. Her beautiful hair in that slight summers breeze. Her brow furrowed in thought. "I.... I don't know. But I do know that I can't live without you." She turned and smiled, slightly squeezing my hand. "And if that isn't what a soul mate is then I don't know what is." But now as she lay before me in her favorite dress, enveloped in velvet I realized that even though we have soulmates, maybe we shouldn't go looking for them. As I laid the flower near her heart, thankful that the blanket covered the bullet wound that took her, I couldn't help but think "Perhaps a it's better to have never found a soulmate at all..." as I tried to hold it together..... but a single tear made it past.
