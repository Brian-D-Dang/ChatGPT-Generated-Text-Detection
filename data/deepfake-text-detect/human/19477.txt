Due to the massive conflict of interest and, as the bible so eloquently puts it, one simply cannot serve two masters. I cannot fathom how dual-citizens are lawfully capable of holding public office. They would seem to be extremely likely to vote and advocate the other country above the one they are serving currently. We will never know if they are actively serving other states prior to the interests if America. How can an honest dual citizen be trusted, with their dedication to another separate state, serve the US exclusively while in office. Are you aware of how many dual citizens are currently hold a position of power in the US government, and the second state they claim to? Am I crazy for seeing this as a massive irreconcilable conflict of interest? Change My View, please! (Ed. spacing)
