To pull an example of a single thread forum off the web: [here] . The only situation where single threads might be good is where a fixed group is involved, for example project planning by a small team or a roleplaying session with a game master. In that case, it might be good to prevent the conversation from fracturing and keep everyone on the same page. When it comes to most social or entertainment purposes, reddit's style of branching threads with updownvotes just works better. -It prevents the loudest people in the conversation from drowning everyone out. In addition, it allows you to ignore particularly obnoxious posters. -It allows discussion of a tangent without derailing the main topic. -It allows you to go back to earlier posts in the conversation and address points that were overlooked the first time around. -Upvotes give you a way to silently voice approval, without wasting words to repeat what the other poster said. -Reddit's AMA tradition is one of the better ways of conducting public interviews, and it would not be possible in a single thread forum. With all these advantages, I don't think that single thread forums should be used as much as they are. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
