Please leave the note below the following line, but remember to delete this sentence. Thank you! Alright. Let me start off by saying I'm an atheist. That, however, will play no bias in this discussion. The First Amendment states that, and I will paraphrase this, the government can not support any single religion and pass any laws promoting a single religion. So, why do the dollar bills in your wallet contain the phrase "In God We Trust"? The same goes for the Pledge of Allegiance. The passage that American students recite in unison every morning. This contains the phrase "Under God." I don't believe that "because it's tradition" is a good enough excuse to break Constitutional Amendments. It's been stated that it has "secular meaning," but there is nothing secular about it. It was added in the McCarthy Era back in 1954 because "a Communist would never dare utter it." Even if it wasn't perpetuated as a religious thing, but instead a communist witch hunt, it still gives advancement to a single religion. The fucking Knights of Columbus. Let's see if you can change my view. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
