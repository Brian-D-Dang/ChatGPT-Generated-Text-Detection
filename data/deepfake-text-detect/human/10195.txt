I believe free speech is important, and a generally good thing. However, if you state with an idea, let's say "Forks are a blight upon society," and someone disagrees with you, if you immediately jump to free speech as defense of your idea, you are basically admitting that you have no worthwhile arguments. Yes, you are allowed to say that, but if you actually had something to back it up, say "sporks are far more versatile, cutting the required utensil manufacturing by a third, reducing global warming 93," you would say that. Free speech does nothing to back up the validity of your claim, as you are free to be wrong. EDIT: I have been convinced that it can be a way of simply saying you do not wish to argue the point further, that you want to let the argument stand where it does. And, to clarify, I am not talking about free speech as a legal concept. Having to prove your speech legal says nothing as to its validity. I mean having to fall back on free speech as an argument does nothing to prove you right. EDIT 2: I now feel that an argument for, or against someone's right to a viewpoint has no bearing on the validity of the viewpoint. But, the person who first feels the need to argue this right, however, likely has no argument. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
