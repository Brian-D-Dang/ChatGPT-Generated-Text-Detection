A torrent is basically a downloadable file or application that is shared from peer-to-peer. Seeding is when you agree to let people download the file from you after you have already downloaded it. When you see how many seeds a torrent has, this is showing you how many people are offering the file to be downloaded. Leechers are people who are downloading the file at the same time. So basically, for the fastest downloads you want to find a high number of seeds, and low number of leechers. It is a common courtesy to seed your torrents after you download them to help out the next guy. Hope I helped!','A torrent is information about some files (their checksums) and information about who has the respective files (people you can connect to in order to retrieve them). "Seeding" a torrent is staying online in order for others to be able to get files from you. First person who puts the torrent online is the initial seeder.
