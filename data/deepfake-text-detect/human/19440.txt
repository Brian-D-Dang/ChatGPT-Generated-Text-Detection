Given that the main principle of democracy is the will of the people, and that the barometer of that will is the majority, I don't believe that democracy provides support to ideas or actions that fall outside the norms of society. Given that constraint I do not believe that democracy can provide for freedom - instead it provides an impetus to "follow the herd," or at least not to stray too far. I further believe that nations have been able to protect individual liberties to the extent that they dilute the democratic nature of the system - with safeguards like elected officials with fixed terms, unelected judges, etc. The majority of social movements that increase liberty (civil rights, slavery, etc etc) have generally been imposed through such counter-democratic methods. They usually faced strong majoritarian backlash at the time - and I believe in a pure democracy they would not have happened. Change my view.
