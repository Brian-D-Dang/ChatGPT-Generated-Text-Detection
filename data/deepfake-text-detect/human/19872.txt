I'm not denying the need for secular organizations to keep religious extremism in check, but I believe that the majority of the members from groups like Freedom From Religion Foundation and The Richard Dawkins Foundation are primarily made up of bullies who just want to antagonize religious people. I see Christian hate groups like the American Family Association and I compare them with FFRF and I see little to no difference. Two sides of a coin. CMV
