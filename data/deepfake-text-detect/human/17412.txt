In order for a child to be sucessful, heshe needs to be raised in a stable household economically, socially, and emotionally. It is the responsibility of the parents to maintain this stability. A divorce screws up the devolopment of the child, because heshe is being removed from the previous household climate, and is likely to become depressed and emotionally unstable. The only excusable times for a divorce while raising kids would be if there is clear domestic violence or abuse, in which case the child is not safe. Otherwise, divorce neglects the child's emotional needs, the same way exposing the child to second hand smoke neglicts hisher health needs. Marriage is like a contract, and it is irresponsible for it to be broken without a valid reason. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
