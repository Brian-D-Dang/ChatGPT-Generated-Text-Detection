One is that you often need very basic technologies to get civilization started and sometimes, the idea literally never occurred to anyone, which can make civilization harder. The Mexica (Aztecs) didn't have the wheel. And yet even without wheels they still managed to build a pretty impressive civilization and the most accurate calendar of its time, (and also, uh.... daily human sacrifices).
