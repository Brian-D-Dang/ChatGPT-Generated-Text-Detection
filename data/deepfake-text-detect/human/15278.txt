I always call this place Chiptole for pizza. lol I love that you get to choose everything... literally everything!! the combonations are endless and definitely takes me forever to make one cause I can't decide. I have yet to have a bad experience here and I definitely visit often. It is down the street from my house, but even if I lived in Boulder City I would make the drive. DELICIOUS!!!
