This is something that's always bothered me, all the way back to when I was a kid. I never understood why it was considered polite to say "bless you" after someone had sneezed. From my understanding, because people believed sneezing was a demon being expelled from your body, they would say "bless you." Nowadays, that doesn't really make sense, and I doubt that anybody believes that is the reason people sneeze. Now I don't really care if people prefer to say "bless you" after they hear someone sneeze, but it's absolutely ridiculous that some people actually get upset, and will even go as far as calling someone out for not saying "bless you" after they'd sneezed. They simply had a tickle in their nose and their body was getting whatever particles it didn't want in the nose out. Some may say that it's similar to saying "excuse me" when they burp, fart, or yawn, but I disagree. Saying excuse me is a way of apologizing for being a disruption, while saying "bless you" is a silly way of saying "I acknowledge that you have sneezed." Saying "bless you" doesn't make sense, and while it doesn't hurt to say, I shouldn't be ridiculed for refusing to congratulate someone on their sneeze. It becomes more disruptive than the sneeze itself and it's just silly. Please, please CMV. I'm tired of getting shit for not wanting to say "bless you" but I'm also too stubborn of an asshole to conform.
