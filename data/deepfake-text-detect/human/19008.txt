The advent of autonomous vehicles is indicative of a new area of law to be considered. We are introducing vehicles capable of decision-making to the general public and as such these creations need to be subject to intense road safety regulations as well as have uniform legislation (not the car aspect, the decision-making aspect) specifically addressing this matter put into place. The autonomous car differs from a regular car because drivers can't be expected to adhere to a uniform standard beyond obtaining a license. Autonomous cars, however, can be expected to adhere to a factory standard of near perfection. If they couldn't, they wouldn't be allowed on the road in the first place. States can administrate human traffic as they individually please because of the unreasonable expectation of standard ability. Autonomous traffic, since autonomous cars will be near identical for the foreseeable future, should be held to a uniform standard or require that operators who do not interfere with the car's decision-making processes at the time of an accident are not held accountable. Since we are approaching a whole new era of technology, we are also approaching an era of revolutionary legislation, and we should tread carefully in order to make the least amount of mistakes possible regarding current legislation of future technology.
