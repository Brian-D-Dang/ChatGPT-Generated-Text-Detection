It is what it promises... a gypsy cafe. there is a fortune teller there occasionally. The waitstaff is great. The menu is always changing. The food, the prices, and the atmosphere are awesome. Similar to the Zenith vibe further down on carson st. Very quirky and interesting. the hours are strange, but if you can work around that, definately check it out!!
