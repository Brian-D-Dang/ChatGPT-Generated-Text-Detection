Pretty good service, but really busy and noisy!! It gets a little overwhelming because the sales people are very knowledgeable and bombard you with useless techy information to I guess impress you?? Anyways I bought the Ipad 3 and it is freaking awesome and makes up for the store. I would give the Ipad 3 a gazillion stars if I could. I left it at home today and got really sad when I was driving away. Boo Hoo!!
