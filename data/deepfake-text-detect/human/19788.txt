I don't know why this is the case, because otherwise I am a very compassionate person who cares a lot about humanity and about difference and about treating everyone with dignity and respect, but I have never been comfortable around people with autism, down syndrome, etc. I know that that's normal when you're a kid, but I'm twenty-six years old and I've been ashamed of this for a good long while. I don't know how to interact with them and there's a nagging, bullying voice in the very, very back of my brain when I see them and it just makes me feel awful. Please CMV! I feel like I just don't know enough about the issue or the community and maybe once I learn more I'll be able to be more compassionate and understanding about it.
