A study on birth rates between 1950 to 2017 (across all countries) showed a crazy decline in birth rates from 4.7 children per woman in 1950 to 2.4 children per woman last year. In over half of countries, this number is now below 2, meaning there aren't even enough children to maintain the population size. There were no countries like this in 1950. As countries get richer, three factors cause women to have less children: fewer deaths in childhood, greater access to contraception, and more education and work opportunities. On the low end, in Taiwan women only have 1 child on average, whereas women in Niger have 7.1 children on average. Ultimately, society may have to change substantially to cope with these demographic changes perhaps by increasing immigration, encouraging women to have more children, or raising the retirement age.
