Pork, is by far the most versatile of meats. It has more variety than any other animal can offer. The ears can be used for dog treats. The shoulder is used for pulled pork and similar dishes. The arms can be used for sausage. The loin can be used for roasts or dishes like pork chops. There are both spare and baby back ribs. Hind legs are what we consider to be ham (whether lunch meat or ham steaks). What's important here is just how different all these parts are and the resulting dishes. Also I am only counting dishes consisting of pure meat, I'm not counting anything that can be used as just a part of a dish such as in stews or chilis. I believe that no other animal can compare to the variety of meat offered by pigs. CMV!
