A dehumidifier is just an air conditioner that doesn't vent its heat outside. You have a liquid refrigerant that travels through an expansion valve where it's converted into a vapor. It gets very cold as it expands. It's then run through a cooling coil. Hot, humid air is blown by a fan through the now cold coil, causing water to condense and drip into a bucket or drain. This warms up the vapor, which is then compressed via a pump. It them flows into a condenser which cools the vapor back into a liquid and the cycle continues. A dehumidifier just vents the heat from the condenser back into the room, where as an AC unit vents it outside. So a dehumidifier doesn't actually cool, it just dries the air. Which is handy for damp environments like basements that don't need cooling, but where mold is a concern.,You basically create a very localised cold spot for water to condense on. Water condenses, drips off, and falls in the bucket.
