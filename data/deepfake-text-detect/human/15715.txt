So extremely disappointed. My mother booked two nights at the Stratosphere for a much needed couples week-end with my husband. She used Expedia. Cus we Expedia the Stratosphere kept telling us we booked with a third party and to work details out with them. Expedia said to call hotel and request room type and preferences. When I did I was told hotel did not have our reservation from Expedia yet and call back day before. When I called a day before I was told rudely we were in the old un remodeled part of the tower in two queen bed and it was to late to make changes. Once we got there we did get one queen bed but very far from the pool and with a horrible view of the rooftop of another building and depressing North Las Vegas. We ate diner at Mac gross -the most pathetic attempt at a steak house. Gross. The pool closes at 7. There is only ONE POOL and it's full of kids in clothes. Sunday we slept in. Skipped brunch an decided to have dinner in the tower at 11:00pm. Everything was closed (with exception of the diner) club 107 had only 4 appetizers available out of the entire menu. None appetizing. By the way.... We had to pay 15 per person per day to. Use the facilities as a guest of the hotel! WTF?! That was 90 extra for a gross kid filled jacuzzi and a pool that closed at 7! A restaurant that closed too early to enjoy and a stinky old room with a debtor easing view. No wonder 7 people have committed suicide here! We should have stayed in Laughlin!
