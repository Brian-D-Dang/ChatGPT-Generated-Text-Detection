I have pirated media in the past as a teenager and know many people who still do. I have also stolen physical goods from a store. What baffles me is that there are many arguments for piracy on the internet. Some topics that come up are that it creates better distribution models but I don't believe that piracy itself has anything to do with that. There is even a line in The Social Network where te creator of Napster says he changed the music industry for good. Is there any real evidence that piracy has helped an industry or even an individual artist? I believe that ultimately it is the same thing as stealing a physical copy, not only legally but morally as well. Many people on the internet seem to think otherwise so please try and change my view.
