I have mostly eaten New York style and I have eaten Chicago deepdish only on some occasions, but when I do I find that it takes a lot to just cut it neatly and eat it. It is also rather large and bulky, making it very filling with just one half of a slice. I also don't like the fact that you have to buy a whole pizza rather than just one slice, rather than New York style. I also don't like the fact that deepdish has the cheese on the inside of the pie, I don't know why this irks me, but it does. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
