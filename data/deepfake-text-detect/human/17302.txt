So this is my view: By raising the minimum wage to 15hr, people who were already making 15hr before this increase are now making the same as those who were previously earning less. This leads to people who were getting paid more than minimum wage for x labor getting paid the same as someone who is doing x-y labor. This will lead to an escalation in which the people making 15hr demand to go to 23 and then the people making 25 32, etc. To change my view- Convince me why these workers would not demand a pay increase decide to do less work for the same pay.
