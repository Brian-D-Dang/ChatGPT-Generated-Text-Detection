I support LGBT rights. I want my children to support the LGBT community too, but I can't take them to a gay pride parade. There is a lot of inappropriate imagery and goings on that I don't want my children exposed to. The parades also reinforce the stereotype that homosexuals are out-of-control nymphomaniacs. This fear fuels the conservative agenda: "If you want to see what the gay community is all about, go watch their pride parade. Do you want your children to accept that as a normal predisposition in life?" I feel like the gay community should have a positive outreach celebration to show everyone how "normal" the average gay person is. I've heard the argument that the pride parades exist for homosexuals to just be themselves, but I don't agree with it. To me, that's like having a heterosexual pride festival full of explicit sexual themes. CMV
