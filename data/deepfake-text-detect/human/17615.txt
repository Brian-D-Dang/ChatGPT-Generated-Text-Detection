I grew up in a family that valued education immensely. Years before the bachelor degree was a norm. They said, as a student, you need to achieve the most you possibly can and find value as a citizen in all of your coursework. Strangely, it seems the United States has become so segregated academically, that we simply are not producing as many capable people (i.e. humanities majors with no financial understanding, engineering majors who are mostly 21st century assembly line workers, etc...). Possibly the worst outcome of our education system is business majors, I've personally viewed over a hundred business majors move through the system without actually gaining essential literacy or mathematical concepts. It certainly doesn't help that there is a extremely shallow divide between science and the humanities right now. Worse yet, most of our college grads know next to nothing about geography. The statement that we have serious issues academically is a understatement. The new segregation is making itself very apparent when you look across the country. The people with the strongest educations have classes in humanities, technology, and finance. The rest of America is forced to pick between the different options. Engineering degrees especially are devoid from any critical thinking, ignored in preference to superior analytical capabilities. I mean, many of these students, graduate like with absolutely no redeeming skills. I just don't understand how it's gotten this bad. Maybe there isn't enough teachers, but, frankly, I think this shit gets a lot more serious in the next 20 years.
