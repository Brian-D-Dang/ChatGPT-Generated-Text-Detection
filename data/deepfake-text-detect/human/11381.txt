Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO and former Alphabet executive chairman, has announced his decision to step down as a board member of Alphabet. He will be retained in the company as a technical advisor but wishes to focus on other things such as teaching and the work at his philanthropic organization. While Schmidt has been a key player in causing Google to become the company it is today, there has also been controversy with his leadership. Google has recently come under scrutiny for sexual misconduct within the company, and Schmidt had been named in a lawsuit involving harassment by multiple executives.
