This is a problem I always encounter when I drive on a highway. The speed limit in the most used highway where I live is 70. I usually go at around that speed (give or take 3-5 miles). Now, I have noticed that an alarming amount of people that are driving behind me get impatient and just speed on ahead of me (which is perfect, if there is no danger of crashing). I usually notice that these people are going at at least 90 mph, and they don't slow down. This just angers me so much, I feel like I'm constantly being put at risk by boneheads that are too impatient to drive on the speed limit. I commented this to a lot of friends and most of them tell me that I'm wrong, because "nobody follows the speed limit," and I'm going too slow. They say it's perfectly fine to drive at 90 miles on a highway which indicates to drive at 20 miles less. I don't know anymore. Am I wrong? Should I start speeding too? Hello, users of CMV!
