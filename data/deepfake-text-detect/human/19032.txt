Please talk me into it. Here is the misinformation I have: -I will be ineligible to receive organ donation at any point in my life if I am diagnosed with an eating disorder -I will have to write on every medical form, even dentistry and optometristy, that I have been diagnosed -My insurance will go up - If I talk to my university counselor, they may contact my family, or somehow affect my financial aid or enrollment - I will never be "cured," just struggle daily not to get back into old habits - Trying to eat properly will cause more anxiety than not eating at all -I will gain weight -I have the ability to get help and treatment without a doctor CMV.
