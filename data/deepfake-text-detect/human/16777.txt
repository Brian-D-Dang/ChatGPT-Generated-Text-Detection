We defined in a new multiplicative c -differential, and the corresponding c -differential uniformity and we characterized the known perfect nonlinear functions with respect to this new concept, as well as the inverse in any characteristic. The work was continued in, investigating the c -differential uniformity for some further APN functions. Here, we extend the concept to the boomerang uniformity, introduced at Eurocrypt '18 by Cid et al., to evaluate S-boxes of block ciphers, and investigate it in the context of perfect nonlinearity and related functions.
