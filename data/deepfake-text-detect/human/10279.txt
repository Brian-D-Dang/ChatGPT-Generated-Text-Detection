Hey, So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about..... this just doesn't make any sense to me. It seems to me that if we could view all orbiting matter on a single plane the size of even the earth's crust it would be very clear that space debris is not an immediate issue. The amount of debris relative to the size of the area is not that much.... not even taking into account that it isn't happening on a plane but in 3-D space. Why is this wrong with this? I guess this doesn't take into account gravity (the gravitational pull of a satellite may be substantial at orbit - making collision highly likely). Or perhaps the scale of damage even a bolt could have... but these to me seem so remote.... Over the next, 20 years we will launch a lot more satellites - but onlymaybe then they may become an issue - but at the present time it's like talking about not getting in your car because you are worried about drunk drivers - it may be acceptable but it is not rational Hello, users of CMV!
