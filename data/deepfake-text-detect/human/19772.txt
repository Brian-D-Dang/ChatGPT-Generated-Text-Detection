my position is that reality follows phisics without exception therefor all action in reality are a reaction of different effects comming together. for example, if we roll a dice, the idea that the result is random can only be maintained if we are ignorant to all the variables applied to the dice, if we where to know them with precision, we could predict exactly how the dice would land, rejecting the idea of randomness. I believe the same applies to free-will, I think that our mental proceses are ruled by chemistry, which is also an exact science (assuming we have all variables) our decision to take certain actions or think certain thoughts is one predisposed by those variables, and that we cannot do otherwise. so I think reality and everything that exists in it is preordained since the beguinning of time, just like a rock falling in a vaccum has no choice as to which forces affect it and what direction it moves in this variables include everyting from the chemistry of our brains to the physics of our atoms, to our perspective of reality, and social preasure.
