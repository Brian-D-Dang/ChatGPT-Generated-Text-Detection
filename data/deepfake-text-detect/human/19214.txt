A human society grows. It reproduces, or has the potential to reproduce, by forming colonies. It eventually dies. It gains information from the external world via science and responds to that information via collective deliberation and action. It regulates its internal conditions through morality, ethics, and laws. It gains matter and energy from the environment via forestry and harvesting. It metabolizes organic and inorganic compounds into new materials through industrial processes. It gets rid of waste products via garbage dumps and sewers. It outlives its parts. A human society is a single collective organism. CMV Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
