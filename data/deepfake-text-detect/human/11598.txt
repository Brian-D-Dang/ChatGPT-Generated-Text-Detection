Apple's new Human Interface Guidelines suggest that developers place the new 'Sign in with Apple' button in iPhone and iPad apps above other sign-in options. Users generally select the default or first option available in apps, and the 'Sign in with Apple' option will soon be compulsory if users are required to provide login details. While developers are not required to follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, many believe that following the guidelines is the surest way to gain approval.
