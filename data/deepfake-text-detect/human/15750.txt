I brought my old ford taurus to change or fix the steering pump and left the car with Sun overnight. I was very specific saying, I need to fix the pump before I sell the car. They said, we understand. Next day I came, they gave me an estimate 1959! This is for a 1000 car! In the estimate, they offered to change each and every steering part. As a result, I had to drive the car without the pump back home and you know how hard it is.
