Aside from celebrating achievements or specific, one-time occasions (e.g. weddings, funerals, etc.), I think that other celebrations do not matter. Christmas, birthdays, Halloween, Easter, and other such occasions have no real connection to our lives, and I think that the effort put into such celebrations is hardly worth it. I understand the concepts behind occasions such as Thanksgiving (obviously, to give thanks), but why do we not treat every day equally (in this case, be equally thankful every day)? I also know that many people just use celebrations as excuses to party hard and get completely smashed (which I've never understood to be particularly fun either). There is a certain bias here, because I do not derive much pleasure from celebrations, either because I have never experienced any good celebrations, or because I do not enjoy celebration in itself. I would love to hear other viewpoints, because anybody else I talk to will call me a party-pooper or something along those lines. Also, please try not to use anecdotal evidence, as you may enjoy celebrating more than I do.
