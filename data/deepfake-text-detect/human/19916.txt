I know there's a huge moral case against this view, and I've tried to ask myself this: should we treat for madness or punish for badness? But no matter how rational my reasoning for the against camp is, I can't seem to convince myself that these people should seek rehabilitation. Why is it fair for us, as taxpayers, to help feed, clothe, and shelter monsters like this in prison? When we can just rid the world of these things by killing them. Yes you may claim this isn't a useful deterrent, but the less of these there are, the better our society will become and the more we can protect the vulnerable in society (ie. woman alone at night, children, elderly etc.). Using moral meansmethods to "cleansecure" these people is just a joke. We spend millions of rehabilitation but not only are the results discouraging for the amount spent, why should these people have a second chance at life, or at (most likely) killingcapitalising on more vulnerable members of our society? These people don't only destroy the lives of their victims, but also their families. These people are morally grotesque and hard, and by committing these vile acts they concede their moral rights. Which is why it is unfair on the victims to use the moral case for these people, as they don't uphold the same principles that protect them, themselves. Hello, users of CMV!
