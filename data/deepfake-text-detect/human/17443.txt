It's odd isn't it? Displaying a dead body? The coroner preserves it, they put make-up on the corpse and dress it up nice to go into the ground where no one will ever see it again unless they're planning to exhume them. I don't know if it's just me , but the idea of someone else choosing how I look and then parading people in front of the body is awful because that's the last memory they'll have of that person. A body in a coffin with caked on makeup in a nice dress looking like a peaceful sleeping person. If that's not how they were alive that shouldn't be how they're remembered when they're dead.
