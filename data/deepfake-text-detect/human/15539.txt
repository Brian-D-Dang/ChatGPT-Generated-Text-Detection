Had the prix fixe menu featuring Hot Sour Soup, pepper steak, General Tso Chicken and a lobster tail done Chinese Style with Raspberry Chocolate Cake for dessert. YUM! I could totally make a meal on the Hot Sour Soup and Chicken alone! BEST General Tso Chicken I have ever had. Tender chicken and the sauce was the boss. The lobster tail was perfectly done and had a different taste to it which was some sauce they had put on top. Steak was better than average, but the other items outshined it. Dessert was great as well. Not pleased with Martinis.... had 4 different ones between 2 of us and didn't like any of them. Went with the Sapporo. Dinner was 49 per person plus drinks and tip. Would return, but when I'm in Vegas, there are TOO many different restaurants there to go to the same one twice unless it absolutely rocks. Tasty, but not memorable..
