Excellent plumbing service! Called late Saturday scheduled for Sunday. Called 30 minutes prior to appt as stated. Arrived on time and fixed my problem in fifteen minutes. The crappy Home Depot captured nut puller failed and I could not get the nuts off the copper pipes. His puller pulled them quickly and he installed the new valves and hoses while he was in there. 90 dollar base for a visit. Paid 90.
