This place is a real Scottsdale secret! They are not fancy. Just a place that I think distributes to mostly high end restaurants, but will sell to the public also. Great prices and awesome access to source to high quality meat. I bunch of unmarked trucks out front and you walk into a basically a meat cutting center with a counter. The guy who waited on me was very nice, knowledgeable and wanted to help me out even though I was not his biggest customer. I wanted half a tenderloin and he said if I could come back the next day he would save me the center from the cuttings. It was over 3 lbs of the best part for about 40! I will make 6 nice fillet mignon out of it.... I can't wait to go back and try some other cuts and see what else he can hook me up with.
