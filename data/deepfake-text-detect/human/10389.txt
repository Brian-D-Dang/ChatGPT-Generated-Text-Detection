EDIT: Lots of very well rounded, interesting points. Thanks! Really helped with my perspective. EDIT 2: I've been awarding deltas to people whom have been making some very good, solid points...but then I get a message from the delta bot informing me that I didn't do it correctly. I just want you all to know that you have successfully changed my view! Thank you so much for all your insight, I really appreciate it. I watched the documentary on A-Sexualism and I'm not convinced. I think these people that identify as "asexual" either haven't found the'right' person for them yet, are just looking for attention, or just joining part of a trend to seem'interesting' or'different'. I think if you're born with a set of a genitals, you are in fact a sexual being and in turn, feel some sexual attraction to other humans. I understand how this can be offensive. I look at my brother who is gay and I understand where he comes from, and the obstacles he overcomes through being gay, and I just can't sympathize with people who identify as'asexual' and implicate that they endure the same struggles as someone from the LBGT community. Please change my view!
