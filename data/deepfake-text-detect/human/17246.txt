So I've seen a lot of debate recently, most likely spawned from all the shootings, that say our culture is in some sort of moral decline. People are blaming the media, the divorce rate, and pretty much everything else under the sun on this change. To those people, our culture went from a moral, god-fearing, sensible one to a highly individualistic, greedy, immoral one. I don't believe there's really any change at all, least of all a decline. Yes, our culture is changing with the rise of the media and our cushy first-world lives, but our culture has always been in a constant state of change. Do we have the same culture as that which existed in Medieval Europe, or the Roman Empire? We've changed drastically over the centuries, and we're not stopping. I for one actually enjoy our individualistic culture because it allows for people to be themselves without the fear of being shunned or stoned to death. I also think people who are nostalgic for the "good ol' days" are fooling themselves into believing in a nonexistent time. I don't think we're any more or less moral as a society than we were a century ago. The media just shows a lot more of what we do as people. It's more out in the open and less private. So I guess you could say I believe our culture is embracing individualism and freethinking, but I don't think it's in any way more or less moral, and I don't think we have anything to worry about. We're not going to degenerate into some sort of hedonistic society.
