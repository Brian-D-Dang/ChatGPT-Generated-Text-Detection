I did not know this until you pointed this out. It turns out that Vitamin D works to transcriptionally activate genes that convert tryptophan to serotonin. Gene transcription and actual benefits can take up to a couple of weeks for it to actually start having an effect. The human genome is long and full of junk, so it takes quite some time for the active portion of the Vitamin D signaling system to find the necessary genes. Once the process starts though, cellular metabolism and synthesis occur within a few hours of assembly.', "uRedditorDoc covered the transcription part. The actual production of vitamin D in your skin is grossly mechanical and extra-cellular. I forget all the names, but you body produces an oily substance that saturates your skin (looked it up, it's 7-dehydrocholesterol). The UV-B radiation in sunlight changes that into Vitamin D. That also saturates the skin and your body re-absorbs the modified chemicals. So if you wash your skin immediately before or after the exposure you'll literally wash away much of the benefits of the activity. Also, since it's UV-B, the further from the equator the less the sun works because of increased atmospheric penetration distance. (the sunlight slants through the air instead of coming straight down, so the air blocks more of the UV-B.) Consequently, here in Seattle the UV-B levels drop away within an hour of local noon. So afternoon or morning sun does virtually nothing to provide vitamin-D, you have to go out at the right time, and you have to go out greasy.... 8
