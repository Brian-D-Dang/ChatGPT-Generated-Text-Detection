Nowhere inspires my wrath more than Tempe Marketplace, except maybe a Super Walmart parking lot. But I think they're building one of those here, too. Add in a Babies'R' Us and you'd hit the slit-my-wrists trifecta. Kabuki would probably get three stars from me if it weren't located in the midst of this fakey-fake urban experience mall bullshit. But it is, so it doesn't. Plus, they make their iced tea with tap water and it tastes like shit. But coworkers looooove lunching at Tempe Marketplace. It's close to the office, and it's easy to drive and park there (never mind that we could walk to Mill Ave.) So OK, fine. I'm game, unless it's Maria Maria. I've been here twice once for lunch and once for happy hour. Well, we tried to go for happy hour. It ends at 6:00. Fuck you, too, Kabuki. I work too late for that bullshit. Next time I'll just go to Ra, where I might get severely injured eardrums from the ear-splitting club music bullshit. But at least they have cheap HH prices'til 7:00. And they're on my drunk bus route home.
