So after this [post] and an unsatisfactory response i really want a good explination as to why the ability to group by 3 or 12 makes the imperial system inherently better for "trade measurments" for want of a better term. In many discussions about the merits of the metric system its often pulled out that 1 yard 3 feet, so the imperial system can divide into thirds easy and this is a good thing. I fail to see any advantage in this, considering you are just as likley to get 1200mm, 900mm, 300mm, as a starting point as we are nice whole multiples of feet and yards. I hope what im getting at here is clear. So CMV.
