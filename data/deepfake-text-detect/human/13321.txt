The country's best detective Michael Hobbs For unknown reasons has assumed this role As substitute teacher, of all the jobs; And what's he find but a murder most foul? The bloody pacifier found on toddler, The trail of Lego bricks on the scene, That led to tableau of merciless slaughter And screaming children, like a nightly dream. The years of bloody work have left a shell Of man who sees the torture of a lifetime Inside the cold and lifeless eyes, like hell, That gaze back at him from the violent crime. Alas, delusioned Michael, upon a closer look, Discovered that the blood was only ketchup.
