Capitonym is a word referring to words who have different meaning when capitalized differently. There is difference between a Pole and a pole and between polish and Polish (what is with Poland and capitonyms). When the lower case polish gets capitalized it loses its meaning. Another thing, we use computers now. We have to press shift every time we begin a sentence. Those nanoseconds add up you know? And for what? Nothing. We have periods to tell us when a sentence ends.
