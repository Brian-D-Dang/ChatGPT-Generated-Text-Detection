In a multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problem, agents need to navigate from their start to their goal locations without colliding into each other. There are various MAPF algorithms, including Windowed Hierarchical Cooperative A, Flow Annotated Replanning, and Bounded Multi-Agent A. It is often the case that there is no single algorithm that dominates all MAPF instances. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the use of deep learning to automatically select the best MAPF algorithm from a portfolio of algorithms for a given MAPF problem instance. Empirical results show that our automatic algorithm selection approach, which uses an off-the-shelf convolutional neural network, is able to outperform any individual MAPF algorithm in our portfolio.
