I get that if one person gets another drunk and takes advantage of that, it could be considered rape. There exists a willful action of one person exploiting another in this case, and the party responsible for the exploitation can and should suffer the consequences. However, in the case in which one or two people get drunk of their own accord and they have sex, both parties should be held responsible for their own actions. In this case, I don't think that the woman should have the prerogative to declare this incident a "rape" because of how she feels about the incident in retrospect while sober. At the very least, if this is the case, the male should have equal claim to deem the event a "rape" as the female does, yet the weight of the blame very often is one sided. Don't get me wrong- I'm not saying that a drunk person ever has the right to be excused from their actions. If any form of force is imposed from one party on another or if anything otherwise illegal occurred, the state of inebriation is no excuse for the other actions taken. I'm solely speaking about cases in which two people drink and end up having sex with one another.
