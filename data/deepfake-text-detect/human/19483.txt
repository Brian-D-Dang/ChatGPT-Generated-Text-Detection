Now I grew up in a rough situation and my family received assistance until I was old enough to work and we were able to get back on our feet. I do not mean to demonize welfare as I believe that is a whole different conversation than what I am trying to present. I personally see welfare (read: government giving people money) as the same as the government giving people money. It is illegal in this country to pay or bribe people for votes. You are supposed to get votes by winning the majority of people over by sharing like ideals, morals and views of what the Country needs. Not just simply paying people off. In my eyes I do not see why anyone on welfare would vote for another candidate if one promises to increase welfare because that means they will get more money. Please try to ignore the other flaws that I know many people like to digress with when talking about the United States' voting system and stay on this one particular topic if possible. When I have this conversation I usually get called an asshole and people assume I am rich so I am hoping if possible this is the right place to change my view. TL;DR Why is welfare not buying votes?
