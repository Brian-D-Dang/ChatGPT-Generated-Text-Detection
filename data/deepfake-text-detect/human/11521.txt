A Bay Area-based startup called Perfect Day has created a lab-grown ice cream that uses whey protein from genetically modified yeast. While there are plenty of dairy-free ice cream alternatives in the market, they generally don't taste as creamy as traditional ice cream. Perfect Day's ice cream is reported to taste exactly like traditional ice cream as it contains the same exact proteins, just produced in a different way, which the company claims uses 98 percent less water and 65 percent less energy than traditional methods. Last week, Perfect Day sold 1,000 three pint samples of the ice cream at 60 each. Perfect Day hopes that it will be able to sell animal-free proteins to big manufacturers. The market for meat and dairy alternatives is growing fast.
