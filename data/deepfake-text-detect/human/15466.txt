Well, once in a lifetime is enough for this I think. I have been there multiple times when friends and family come to visit and am disappointed each time. If you are under 21 they do not even let you come into some of the hotels, not even to get advertised food specials or use the restroom! Not that I would eat the food that came out of any of those hotels but just a heads up! Everything is overpriced, but not as much as the strip. You can get bottle Corona for 2 at some bars which is a deal I have to admit compared to the 9 beers on the strip. The whole street is filled with kiosks selling shirts and other little things, nothing too exciting except for one that does spray paint art in layers live, which is really cool but it draws a big crowd of rude tourists so it's not a place to be for any amount of time. There are also impersonators (some good some should rethink their costume) that will take a picture with you for a mandatory donation. I have never done the zip line but it is quite spendy for just going over a bunch of people, not that good of a view! The overhead lights is the ONLY reason this dump gets 2 stars, I have to admit that it is pretty cool and I have never had a visitor say that they didn't like it. It is short though but what can you say, it's free which isn't a common price in Vegas. Beware if you go, this is where the transients, pimps, prostitutes and loonies hang out! If you like people watching in it's craziest it is entertaining but don't go down a back ally. It is near the Greyhound station as well as the slum of Vegas and the homeless shelter. Not a good area to be in at night! Also getting to the highway is an ABSOLUTE nightmare. They have no signs and they expect you to remember random almost ally streets to find it.
