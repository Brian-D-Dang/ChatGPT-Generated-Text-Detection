I would like to open this with one of my favorite quotes... Of all the weapons in the vast soviet arsenal nothing was more profitable than Avtomat Kalashnikova model of 1947, more commonly known as the AK-47, or Kalashnikov. It's the worlds most popular assault rifle, a weapon all fighters love. An elegantly simple nine pound amalgamation of forged steel and plywood, it doesn't break, jam, or overheat. It will fire whether it's covered in mud or filled with sand. It's so easy even a child could use it, and they do. The Soviets put the gun on a coin. Mozambique put it on their flag. Since the end of the Cold War, the Kalashnikov has become the Russian people's greatest export. After that comes vodka, caviar, and suicidal novelists. One thing is for sure, no one was lining up to buy their cars. -Yuri Orlov ] I believe that the AK47 has proven more popular and more capable in war. The AK47 fires a better and more powerful round, and can still function in sub-optimal conditions. I feel the M16 jams more and fires a weaker round. The difference is accuracy is actually negligible in a battlefield scenario, and most of all the AK47 can be learned in less time and is cheaper with more readily available parts.
