The concept of gender fluidity makes no sense to me. With the exception of some rare cases, nearly all individuals are either biologically male or female, determined by their sex chromosomes (XX or XY). Telling people you feel like and want to identify as a female for the day (and use the women's bathroom) when you identified as a male the day before is ridiculous. Am I misunderstanding the concept? In general, you're either a male or a female (exceptions aside, like those with rare chromosomal anomalies, hermaphrodites, etc.). Edit: I am not referring to transsexual or transgender people who identify exclusively as one gender. My question involves those who identify as "gender fluid," in that they identify as different genders at different times. Edit: The reason I think this idea is leftist is because I've only ever heard this concept promoted by liberals. Note: If you disagree, please cite some form of evidence, perhaps in the form of a website or a link to a scientific study. I'm not looking for an opinion so much as unbiased evidence that challenges my view. Telling me I'm an asshole without giving me reliable evidence isn't going to change my view.
