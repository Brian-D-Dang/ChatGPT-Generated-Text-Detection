Only rich people or people who are supported by the rich have the chance to make it into the congress or parliament. Naturally, no poor or "regular" person can be the president (or a prime minister if you live in a different country). Voting is just an illusion and people who vote are simply naive. They are just the pawns in the game. Basically, voting for someone to represent you is the same as getting paid to vote for a certain individual except the fact that you are doing it for free. In order to become a candidate for any position (even for a candidacy); you need money and network. A regular person has no chance to find these unless heshe is a greedy human being and full of lies. I believe there should be one and only one public TV channel for politics. Anyone who wants to, could go on TV and tell their plans and how they would realize them. It should be illegal to lend money andor no "funding" agencies should be allowed. So, normal people will have the chance at least to be heard. No candidate should be allowed to drive in hisher van (and plane) along the country and give speeches. I am against political parties too. I believe in individuals not a group of money driven people. The honest people among them have no chance to survive. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
