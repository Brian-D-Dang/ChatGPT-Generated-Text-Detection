I don't see the benefit in not eating animal products such as milk. I made a tumblr post about this earlier, and it seemed to piss off alot of people. Cows will still need to be milked, and chickens will still lay eggs (regardless of whether or not the eggs are fertilized, so technically, by eating an egg, you are not eating a baby chicken). I feel bad for the animals that are mistreated in facilities, but as long as the animals are properly cared for before they are used for their products and come from high quality sources, I don't see how being vegan helps. I am really interested to see the responses, because I feel pretty strongly on this.
