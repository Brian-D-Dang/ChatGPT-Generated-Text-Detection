Do you know why vehicles and cars are shaped streamlined? When an object moves fast the air has to move around it to get out of the way, this is called wind resistance. When automobile manufacturers make a vehicle they take lots of things into account, like how fuel economy and the like are affected by how much energy a car has to expend to push past the atmosphere we live in. When a car starts moving quickly the air also has to move around it quickly, creating a fast moving buffer of air that pulls snow and the like with it. The air moving quickly is the same principle that air foils use (such as an airplane wing or the spoiler on a car) There is also a mythbysters episode on this, they drive an open top vehicle in the rain in an attempt to see if they dont get wet. Id expect that has more detail if you are interested.','It's because of the wind flowing over your windshield when you're going fast. The snow will "ride" the wind up and over your car, but when you're stopped there is lessno wind.
