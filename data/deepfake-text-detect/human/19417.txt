I also believe that by arbitrarily censoring certain websites that the mods have pulled the rug out from under the people who initially helped those subreddits grow. These subreddits grew and were supported by people who were operating under the pretense of a very open forum for discussion (available for many different media types and with an open diversity of sources). Then when they subs became huge they clamped down on what they allowed in a way which very much allows the mods to control which stories get the most attention. This, to me, is no small offense and it shouldn't be overlooked or forgotten. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things. Firstly, please remember to [read through our rules] . If you see a comment that has broken one, it is more effective to report it than just downvote it. Speaking of which, [downvotes don't change views] ! If you are thinking about submitting a CMV yourself, please have a look through our [popular topics wiki] first. Any questions or concerns? Feel free to [message us] . Happy CMVing!
