Here's something I see on Reddit all the time. A user spoils the ending of a classic film or book for everyone completely out of the blue. When somebody (usually me) tells him to remove the spoiler, he says: "the bookfilmplay has been out X amount of years. If you haven't read it by now, you probably don't care much about it." I think this argument is absolutely ridiculous. The argument seems to presume we all have infinite time on our hands. Now I consider myself to have read a comfortable amount of classic texts, and seen a comfortable amount of classic films, but the classic or popular booksfilms I have readseen are absolutely dwarfed by those I haven't. I've been on this planet 22 years, but I only read Moby-Dick last year. I only saw Apocalypse Now two years ago. I only read Crime and Punishment a few months ago. My point is that if it were possible for me to experience every story I wanted to experience, the common argument I have mentioned might have a shred of validity. But as it is, I do not believe there is anyone on this planet who has experienced every popular or classic story that exists, and so everything and anything can be a potential spoiler for someone. So if you post a spoiler out of the blue with no warning whatsoever and try to justify it with "but it's been out X amount of years! You have no excuse not to know the story!" your argument is absurd and by refusing to cover up your spoiler, you're simply being an inconsiderate jerk. CMV P.S. - for the record, there are certain stories whose twist endings are so well known that I can forgive people for 'spoiling' them. I wouldn't spoil them myself, nor would I encourage anyone to do so, but I can understand that they're too much a part of the public's collective consciousness to completely censor. I'm referring to The Empire Strikes Back, Fight Club, The Usual Suspects, Citizen Kane, Soylent Green and The Sixth Sense.
