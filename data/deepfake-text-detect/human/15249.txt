My friend and I went here during a destination wedding weekend. I did my restaurant research before arrive so was really excited about eating here. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed. We both ordered the Breakfast American for 22 (3 eggs, 2 pieces of toast and sausage). Neither one of us eat meat so we substituted fruit for the sausage. We also ordered coffee and orange juice. The drinks were just OK, nothing special. The OJ was fresh squeezed but it tasted like they old. There was also no pulp in the glass to let you know it was fresh squeezed. As it turns out, I didn't like any of the coffee in Vegas or any other drinks made with water. So my guess it was my taste buds and not the coffee. They brought the pastry basket pretty quickly. The pastries were fine, again nothing special. When the eggs came they were not as we ordered. I ordered scrambled soft, my friend ordered scrambled hard. When they came out they were exactly the same. All in all it was a disappointing, expensive meal. The service was also fine, nothing special (not that I expect that for breakfast). I'd like to check out the Yountville Bouchon for dinner, but I won't be visiting this location. Save your self for a better experience and go to the Hash House.
