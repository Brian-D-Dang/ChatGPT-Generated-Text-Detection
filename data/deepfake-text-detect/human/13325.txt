Pick one. Pick one what? Pick a life. One in which you are Mr. Anderson, a wealthy programmer, with money and power. You help your landlady bring her grocries in. The other..... You have seventy accounts on seventy MMOs. All at the highest ranking. You have conquered Mount Crotinial, you own Moxly Space Port, you drive a car faster than anyone else. In all of these worlds combined, you have more wealth than the United States Government. Ok..... So what? Do you wish to become the first virtual man? The ghost in the shell as it were? To be in control of the very electrons of the internet itself? To give up reality? Fuck yeah. Plug me in doc. When do we get started?
