I recently read this story [Here] about how Florida is trying to push a bill though that would give somebody convicted of bullying up to 1 year in a prison. There are a few things right off the bat that I can see wrong with a measure like this, but I want to give you some background on how I personally feel about suicide as a direct result from bullying. Firstly I don't feel that you can be bullied to death. When somebody commits suicide its more of a choice than is really talked about. I in no way want to condone or endorse bullying of any kind. I really fucking despise it. As well I really do not like to hear about people committing suicide. It's sad and heartbreaking. It just seems more an more that people who are bullied into committing suicide (which is ultimately a choice) are totally given a pass. Like when it happens and bullying is a cause (notice I said A cause as I feel that most suicides have more underlying reasons and the person may have other emotional and mental health problems that contributed to it) news media and family and friends always talk about the bullying as if it were a gun being held up to the person, an no other conceivable option or route out is available (other then suicide of course.) That's how I feel on that! My main problem with this new law being passed is that any harassment,no matter how minor, can be covered as I feel the word "bully" is to vague to have an entire new law passed based on it. I would really like somebody to give me some reason to change my view, as among people I have talked to about this, I am the only one who holds it.
