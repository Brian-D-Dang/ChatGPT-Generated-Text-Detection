Bunching vs folding has been an ongoing debate of mine, between myself, for a long time. I've tried bunching, because yes, I understand that it creates more space between the hand and the anus, but it seems far less effective as the surface area of the toiletpaper has nooks and crannies in it that may not clean the butt as well as folding would. The symmetry of bunching makes me uncomfortable, I find solace in a neat fold prior to wiping. If I was ever to bunch, I'd be sure to fold over it. For example: If you're in an airport, obviously the toilet paper is thin, so perhaps I'd bunch instead of folding over 10 times. But I'd ALWAYS fold around the bunch. But all you pure breed bunchers out there, why do you do it? Do you bunch because you're afraid to feel your anus? Change my view, redditors, I got a hunch you can make me bunch.
