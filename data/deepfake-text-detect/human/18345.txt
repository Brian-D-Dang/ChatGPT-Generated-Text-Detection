First, what does it mean to "be slutty"? In my opinion, there are varying degrees of being slutty - from sexually repressed (the opposite of slutty) to flirting to promiscuity. I believe that the more slutty you are, the less value your emotional investment is worth. The sluttier person in any given relationship would have to invest more emotionally for the investment to be "equal." I know this is wrong and that I shouldn't think this way, but I do. Please CMV.
