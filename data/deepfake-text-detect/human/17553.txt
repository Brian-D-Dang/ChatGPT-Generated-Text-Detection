Mr. Rogers has the right idea, people want to feel special, important, or that they have utility. But the medium used was TV. You have a passive audience sitting there being told that they are special, and they are just sitting there - accomplishing nothing. People are not special only due to their existence. People need to stretch themselves to their capacity to have a sense of themselves. Just telling people that they are special leads to narcissism, low empathy, and high dependency on public opinion.
