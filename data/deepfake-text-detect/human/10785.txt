In addition to what other people have mentioned, there's actually a whole set of etiquette and unspoken rules about fights in hockey. Most teams have a big guy or "bruiser" who may not be a great player, but is a good fighter. That guy will challenge players on the other team who are being overly aggressive or the other team's bruiser. Also, most fights don't start unless both players agree they want to fight. The end result of all this is that the smaller, faster players are protected from the bigger, stronger players, and the audience still gets to see a cool fight.','Fighting in hockey is not technically allowed, as each player involved gets either a 5 minute penalty (in the NHL and AHL), or thrown out of the game (every other professional league and international play). The reason it's not stopped in the NHL (and AHL) is because it's just been part of the sport in North American play since the game was created. When you put a bunch of guys in a confined space and have them play an already violent game, grudges between players arise. Fighting is also a great morale booster for your team, so if you kick some guy's ass you can really rally your team up, and even if you lose you can still inspire your guys because you "took one for the team" so to speak. The reason it's not tolerated in European and international play is because the difference in style between Europe and North America. European play is more focused on finesse and technique whereas North American play has been traditionally focused on brute strength. There has been talk about banningimposing stricter penalties on fighting, but fans and even players strongly disagree with that. Fighting in North American hockey has been tradition, not to mention a spectacle very popular with fans. TL;DR - Fighting is tradition in the US and Canada, morale booster, and popular spectacle for fans. Source: former playerreferee. Current, life-long fan of the game.
