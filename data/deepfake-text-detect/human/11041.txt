Hydrochloric acid is actually just positive hydrogen ions (H) and negative chloride ions (Cl dissolved in water, thus people refer to it using "HCl." In your stomach it is "made" by cells called "parietal cells." The acidic action is actually caused by H ions. And Cl- is there because it generally doesn't hold on to the H ions, so they're free to react. The hydrogen ions come from reacting water with carbon dioxide to create carbonic acid which is H HCO3- when dissolved in water. Carbonic acid is a weak acid because HCO3- likes to hold on to H and prevent it from doing acidic action. We don't want that, so the parietal cells get rid of the HCO3- ASAP to leave just the H behind. Meanwhile the chloride ions most likely come from salt which splits into Na Cl- when dissolved in water. The parietal cells actually pump out H and Cl- separately and they mix while traveling through small channels that open up into your stomach. Just FYI it takes a relatively high amount of energy to pump H to such a high concentration.
