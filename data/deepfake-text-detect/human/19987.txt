I've noticed that most of the people I've talked to feel as if the lower rung of soldiers, guards, workers, and even civilians hold just as much of the responsibility for allowing The Holocaust to happen as those who organized the genocide. Furthermore, I've often heard that the excuse that they were simply doing as they were told is not a valid reason for their actions and that they should have done something to prevent the mass killings and forced labor. I'm not underplaying the tragedy that was The Holocaust, as it truly was one of the more sickening things that humanity has done, but I do feel that the common workers and soldiers of the camps shouldn't have had to shoulder the responsibility of putting a stop to it as any dissentresistance was far too risky, likely to be ineffective on an individual level, and would likely result in harsh disciplinedeath. Even if they were morally opposed to the actions, as many were, defiance would be a fruitless effort and cause far more harm than good. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
