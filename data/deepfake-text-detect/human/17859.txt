We spend the largest percentage of our economy on healthcare, but the quality of our healthcare is number 37. Our education system is number 29 and we can barely get 75 of our students through high school. We have the greatest defense budget on earth and we can't even stop a few militants in a country with no resources and barely an economy. While our deficit decreases slightly every year, but by the time the budget is balanced we will have more debt than the average can comprehend. Every Senator and Representative has bee bought and paid for by Goldman Sachs. And that piece of paper that we call the constitution seems to have lost all relevance in our Congress. For these reasons and more I believe that the only way to turn America into the greatness that we never weren't is to scrap the system and start over.
