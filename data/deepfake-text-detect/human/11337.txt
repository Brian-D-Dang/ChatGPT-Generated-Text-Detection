A team of scientists used high-energy X-rays to analyze ancient Egyptian papyri fragments and found lead compounds in both the red and black inks used. This is evidence that lead was added for its fast-drying properties rather than for its pigmentation. Painters in Europe used a similar technique when developing oil paints in the 15th-century, except that the Egyptians discovered it 1,400 years earlier. Synchrotron radiation is useful for analyzing art and other priceless artifacts due to its high-energy and short wavelengths. Ink has been used to write for thousands of years, and revealing the secrets of ancient ink technology contributes to our knowledge of the origin of writing practices.
