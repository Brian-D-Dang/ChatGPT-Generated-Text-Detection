This is fairly straightforward. I think all real property taxes should be assessed based solely on the fair market value of the property. It should not matter what the use of the property is, or who lives there. If you own a plot with a value of 300,000, you should pay the same tax as any other owner of a plot valued at 300,000. The most egregious example against this to me is [California prop 13] 1978 which freezes property taxes when you buy a house, essentially subsidizing long-term residents at the cost of more recent arrivals. The basic reasoning for this is twofold. First, there's a fairness question, since the taxes you pay should be the same no matter who you are. In the case of property taxes, they're already progressive in as much as they depend on the fair market value of an asset you own. Second is an efficiency issue. Giving people tax abatements encourages them not to move (as in prop 13) or to not sell when they don't have good use for the property, such as [this woman who is being sued for failing to maintain a property she can't afford to renovate, but keeps paying the very low taxes on.] Hello, users of CMV!
