In fact I would posit that the main reason believes of the latter religions make fun of the former religions is because it reminds them of how silly their beliefs can appear. The example I keep coming back to is what would people say if you tried to start one of the older religions today? The new religion would get ridiculed similarly to Scientology. Shows like the Trey Parker and Matt Stone production are humorous, but you could do that with all mainstream religions. I personally find the WBC picketing funerals of homosexuals bizarre and deplorable, but I don't beleive they are doing anything more deplorable or bizarre then religions from yesteryear have done themselves. The hypocracy is palpable. I think the defensiveness people feel toward Scientology is because it shoves a mirror in their faces and they don't like what they see back. CMV.
