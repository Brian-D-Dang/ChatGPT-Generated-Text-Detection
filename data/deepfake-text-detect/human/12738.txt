M0rt4 heaved a heavy sigh, M0rt4 did. She'd dipped her digi and all her precious bobbles were lost, so they were. M0rt4 was justy frazzled, yess'm M0rt4 was, yes she was crossly. Her quota was 5 for the cycle, 5 claimed so's for the mortal and 2 only for the nonce. M0rt4 had the discretion, dat beautiful word discretion, very oldy it was and strong. STRONG! But her digi had dipped and clinked on pavers so M0rt4 reckoned quite that summa had to get a tuppence and quick-y. M0rt4 spied peeperly the min in the tweedies on his digi run splitwise upstreet. Hee prolly walked a nice meter-six in him's nice hydras. A nice-nice swipe, that. M0rt4 strode crost the street, so she did and briskly. The min dinna not look peeperly, ne'er they did, no min or mam as they lived longwise and sleep-easy. Him's head was splitwise an running redly just so. M0rt4 nicked his digi and squeaked she did, hippy-flowers and marvy-doodles for the afternoon of murr-daz cozen shi was a-murdra, hon. They was a-peepers at that, tell ya as simple; M0rt4 made over smiley tho cuz, innit no crosswise on her, no says the guvner. No, says the guvner official. Says the guvner: "At your discretion." Summa chee!
