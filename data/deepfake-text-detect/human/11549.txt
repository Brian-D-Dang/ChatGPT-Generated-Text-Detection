Singapore currently produces about 10 percent of its food. Due to climate change and population growth, it aims to produce 30 percent of its food by 2030. In order to do this, farmers must utilize space efficiently. Vertical farms now grow non-native fruits and vegetables, and there are plans to build a fish farm which will deliver a twenty-fold increase in Singapore's annual fish output. One company plans to sell lab-grown shrimp meat and it aims to be able to deliver all of Singapore's shrimp requirements by 2030.
