I don't think there is anything wrong with drinking diet soda. I prefer the taste of diet soda over water as a means of hydration. There are zero calories in diet soda, just like there are zero calories in water. Even if you fully replaced your recommended 64 oz. of water per day with diet soda, the sodium in 64 oz. of diet soda would only be about 8 of your daily limit based on a 2000 calorie diet. There's no proof of aspartame being bad for you. The only negative that holds any water (excuse the pun), is that it costs more money than water, which is true but hardly breaking the bank. Meanwhile, probably due to the actually good advice to limit your soda intake, it is a commonly held belief that they should limit their diet soda intake as well. There appears to be no reason to limit your diet soda intake. If there actually is a good reason for this commonly held belief, I'd like to hear it. So for that reason, I'm asking you to please change my view. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
