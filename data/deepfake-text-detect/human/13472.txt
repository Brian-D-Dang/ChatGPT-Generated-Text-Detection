My friend Patty has had a very rough time so far this week. First, on Monday, she got a flat tire on her way to work. On Tuesday, she missed an appointment because she had to work late. Yesterday, she found out she's going to have to work on Thanksgiving. She's hoping this weekend will be easier than the rest of her week!
