I nearly had a heart attack when she appeared in the door. The hospital had wanted Archangel to visit some sick children, offering some money to the superheroine if she would come. On one hand, I did kind of want the money. On the other hand, it might be nice to make some sick kids happy. It had gone on for an hour. I knew Archangel was busy fighting the Fist of the Shadows, so I would be fine. An hour of talking to these sick children. It felt good to cheer up these people whose lives must have held so little joy. Of course the real thing had to appear at the door. "Hey kids! I heard y She stopped mid sentence as she spotted me. All the children gasped. In hindsight, I wonder how they never figured out I wasn't the real Archangel. I was shorter than she was, I was white as the fucking snow while Archangel definitely had some Hispanic heritage, and..... Well, I wasn't as curvy as she was. Returning to the present, the second the superheroine walked in, I froze like a deer in headlights. She walked up to me, slowly and calmly, and took off my mask. "Would you care to tell me why you are impersonating me to these children?" She asked with a glare that would make the Grim Reaper cower in fear. I looked at the kids. "Because I want to make these kids happy." I said. It wasn't the original reason, but it was true. "It makes me feel like I'm really helping. With that, Archangel's expression softened. "What's your name?" "Selena." I answered. "Thank you Selena. You're a real hero. Can you promise me something?" "What?" "Don't ever sell yourself short again. People like me, we're called superheroes for a reason. It takes something else altogether to impersonate me just to make these kids' day." Archangel grabbed my hand. "Say, can I ask for one more thing?" "Sure. Anything you need." She whispered. "What's your phone number." I wrote it down, and she smiled. "Thank you. See you around."
