Devout Christians believe in a literal interpretation of the Bible as the Word of God, so when it states Earth was created in six days and is less than 10,000 years old, believers are supposed to take God's words as truth. Yet, (even though I'm not a Christian) Christians are routinely mocked for believing something that science says is not true, even though it goes against their beliefs. Orthodox Jews believe in following Jewish law strictly and this includes not consuming any food that is not kosher. The historic rational for this is the belief that such foods are "unclean" or unhealthful (see ). Modern science has debunked this superstition, yet you rarely see Jews being ridiculed for adhering to this belief to the extent that retail establishments openly market Kosher foods. I'm not saying that Christians aren't wrong to believe in Creationism as a scientific matter, but then you'd have to also say that Jews are wrong to believe that Kosher foods are better than non-Kosher foods.
