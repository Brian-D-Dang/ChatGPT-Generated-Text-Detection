EDIT title: I don't believe mentally handicapped people should be given the same rights as everyone else. They don't give anything to society and only take time, effort, and money. For the sake of argument I'm going to talk about down syndrome people with an IQ lower than 50 (50 is average). Biologically there not homosapiens because they can't reproduce nor survive Darwinism. I'm not sure on the precise number but special needs kids and adults is a ton of money from the care takers and the taxpayers. Scientists have not been able to prove special needs kids have emotion. Its hard to differentiate between faking emotion and real emotion. To send a DS kid to school and to provide special moving accomoations for them, or constant counseling, or the only time the parents get a break is when there in school. (I say this because the parents could've been making money or something else beneficial instead). Heres where people start thinking I'm trolling... Why can't we harvest their organs and use them for experimental research? Without human or animal testing we would have never found a TON of cures for people. TLDR; Handicapped people cost money, time, and effort all while we could be gaining from them. Change my view
