My position relies on these points: The Bell Curve- The Bell Curve is a 1998 scientific book by Richard Herrnstein and Charles A. Murray, in the book a racial IQ gap is described that has prominent races in the allowing order (from least intelligent to most): blacks, whites, Asians, jews. Subsequent books have been published by Murray supporting his data. Minnesota Transracial Adoption Studies- This study had adopted children of White, black, asian, and mixed decent take IQ test at age 7 and 17, not surprisingly the white children scored highest, then mixed, and finally black. Interestingly mixed children, wether raised to believe they were black or mixed scored the same, which strongly implies IQ is hereditary. This study was also done by a group of people who considered themselves racial equalist. Arthur Jensen studies- during these test blacks and whites were given a sequence of numbers to remember, and there scores were about the same; however, when they asked to repeat the numbers backwards, the blacks did significantly worse. African civilizations have done substantially worse than european civilizations, additionally sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest mean IQ score, bordering on retarded The brain of the average black has been shown to have differences for the brain of the average white or Asian man. I am not racist, I in no way support neo-segregation or anything ridiculous like that
