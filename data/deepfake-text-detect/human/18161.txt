I absolutely hate how this book is written, it seems to repeat itself constantly and I feel like the author is trying to hard to make the conversations seem like they take place in real life, Holden is so damn dumb that I can barely stand reading the book. The ending was so abrupt too, the entire time he is talking about his parents and how he is avoiding them in New York then at the end right when he is about to confront them the last chapter is one page long and essentially summarizes the rest of the book, i feel like it wasn't finished and he just decided his summary of the next part of the book was good enough.
