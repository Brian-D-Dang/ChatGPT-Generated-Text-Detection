NSFW.js allows for client-side content filtering, meaning that image files can be classified before it reaches the server. It classifies images into one of 5 categories: drawing, hentai, neutral, porn, or sexy, and also gives a probability ratio for each image classification. The tool is around 90 accurate, and can lesser server load as well as workload, stopping users from uploading images which may not be appropriate for your website.
