I believe that both the macro-level historical patterns of war, technological innovation and political upheaval and the micro-level patterns of argument, love and personal attachment will continue recycling themselves with an increasing rapidity until some sort of major unprecedented catastrophic event occurs. Population growth is unstoppable, education can only be improved so much in accordance with this rapid growth, and human nature has remained fundamentally unchanged throughout history. Those base 'caveman' urges, while capable of being repressed, will continue revealing themselves until our innate capacities for sex and aggression are potentiated by our technological capacity and we make a massively un-fixable mistake. Imagine Cold War pt 2, but not so cold. Please change my view.
