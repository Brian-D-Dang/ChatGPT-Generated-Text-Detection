I will start with the second point. To help understand this, assume that killing a human being is wrong. Most people believe this, and they do so because of how evolution has influenced humans to want as many humans as possible to survive. Now imagine an alien race from a distant planet that, due to evolving in a highly predatory environment, believes it to be the moral duty of any members of their species to kill any other living thing that can so much as move. There is nothing that makes their beliefs any more right than humans'. Now for the first point: any morals that one has are based solely on what makes them consciously or subconsciously satisfied. Even if they are seemingly altruistic, their beliefs just satisfy their natural urge to help others survive. Therefore, they are selfish.
