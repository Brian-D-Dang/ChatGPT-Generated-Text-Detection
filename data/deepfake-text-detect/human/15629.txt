I have been a regular at Copper Star for the past 3 years. I love the uniqueness of this place - the drive thru with cheerful baristas (os) and the owner (Bill) is actively involved in the community and knows his fellow business owners. Nicest guy you could ever meet. Ok. Now let's get down to business. Coffee- Everyone has a different taste in coffee. I love this coffee so much that I buy their beans by the pound. It usually is a mix of Ethiopian, Guatemalen and Sumatran or other roast. Anyway - I can't say that I have been to a whole lot of different coffee bars in Phoenix, but the ones I have been to don't measure up in flavor, freshness and robust flavor of the beans. Nor can anyone match the friendliness and unpretentiousness of the staff. I have only tried the scones and muffins. Scones are a difficult feat in most places but Copper Star has some of the tastiest. Try the chocolate chip or cranberry walnut scone. During the fall they make homemade pumpkin muffins (using fresh pumpkin) that are to die for. They run out so fast you have to get there early. I wish they would offer these year round.Yum! Because of the coffee, service, and the limited of goodies I have tried so far, plus their community involvement, I am giving this place 5 stars. The patio is very small with a nice fountain and you can bring your dog - After your coffee take Fido across the street for a bath at Wag-N-Wash (but that is a different review). So, if you happen to be in the neighborhood stop by and check out Copper Star. You'll be glad you did. (Say Hi to Mr Bill for me!)
