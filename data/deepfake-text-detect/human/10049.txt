"Normal" (adj.) Conforming to the standard or common type. By the above definition, we can be sure that there is a'Normal' human being. Or at the very least, various'Normal' states to make up a'Normal' human being. Anything that is in the majority is a'Normal' state. So, the'Normal' human being is a Cisgendered, Heterosexual, Chinese man. This means that states such as Transgender, Homosexual, Autistic etc. are not'Normal'. They are in fact'different'. and we desperately need to stop acting as if they are normal. They are different. This does not mean they are worse, undesirable or negative. Nor does it mean they are better, desirable or positive. They are simply different. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
