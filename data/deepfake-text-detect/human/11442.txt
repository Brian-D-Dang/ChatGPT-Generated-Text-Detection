A Windows zero-day exploit tool was stolen from the NSA's Equation Group by Chinese threat actors, who used the tool for years before the flaw was patched. A hacking group released tools and files belonging to Equation Group in 2017, forcing vendors to issue emergency patches and fixes. A tool that exploited one of the vulnerabilities that was fixed during this time was thought to be the work of a Chinese advanced persistent threat group, but it turns out it was actually a clone of one of Equation Group's tools. There are other cases of Chinese teams stealing and repurposing Equation Group tools.
