I've seen a whole lot of this red X on hand thing recently and its made me thing another Kony 2012 or red sign thing has come around. I know they say they give 100 of their proceeds to their partners, but what is to say that their partners aren't taking that cash and splitting it with these people. I don't have the time to go through each partner and look at their spending plan, but I doubt these people are doing it for nothing. All these chain letter type things rarely ever do these kind of things for free. Plus the marketing alone must cost them a ton of money. Anyone have facts to dispute me? I'm sure they must be using some of the money for good, but what proof is there that this isn't another hoax.
