I shower two times a week max and have never had acne or dry skin, or any skin condition for that matter. I have also never been told i smell badly (except for hockey stink, you can't avoid that shit) I exercise regularly and still only shower a couple times a week. I know people that shower multiple times a day (or at least say they do) seems like a big ass waste of water to me.
