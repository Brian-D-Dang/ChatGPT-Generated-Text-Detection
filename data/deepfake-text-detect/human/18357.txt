This "problem" is something I have noted for a while now, and I don't believe it is written about, or discussed enough as a real challenge facing people today. We shop for potential mates through online dating exactly the same way we shop for clothes or electronics through Amazon.com and I think that is a problem. We are becoming increasingly superficial; looks are the be all end all. We up-sell one another all the time. Relationships are harder to maintain because THE second things become difficult, we can simply browse online for another potential match and go from there. Online dating creates unrealistic expectations... Menwomen are checked against a laundry list of required attributes and are disqualified if they don't meet everyone. It cheapens sex. We view each others as items that can be disregarded at a moments notice. Finally, online dating has profoundly negative effects on people who are not desirable.I for one can say that online dating has altered to way I view my own race. It is not a very pleasant realization to come to after facing rejection. TLDR: Online dating is making us increasingly shallow and cheapening sex. I think that we as a society would be better served if I did not exist Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
