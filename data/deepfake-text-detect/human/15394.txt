Like other reviewers, we called and emailed more than 10 companies looking for landscape maintenance quotes with only a handful responding and even fewer coming out to look at our lot. Adrian called us back and came out to check out our lot on the same day I called. He was prepared to work that afternoon, but we had him come back a couple days later. We have several large trees (including a queen palm) and bushes with about a year's worth of growth. Needless to say, our yard was very overgrown. Ultimately, Adrian's quote beat the other estimates by a landslide, and the final product was above and beyond what we were expecting. He was responsive and fast. We plan to call him for all of our future landscape maintenance needs.
