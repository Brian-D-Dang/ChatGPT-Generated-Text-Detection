Chapter 28 Disappointing mum. The conversation was great and awful. I told mom how I must be an old man at heart because at the age of 22 I couldn't stand drinking shots with friends. She laughed. "I can not wait for retirement" I told her. I'm going to have a cottage with a man-cave all to myself. My family can take the rest of the house, but I want that man-cave. "Well, when you're 80 and actually old I hope that man-cave serves you well" she chuckled. "Nah, I don't think I'd want to live that long. I think I'd much rather off myself by, like, 60 or 70, regardless of whether I was fit or dying." Her face went from gleeful to morose in a second. "Don't ever say things like that. It's not funny." "Oh c'mon ma, you know I'm just messing around." She took her drink and left the room. I felt so guilty. I've never felt that guilty before. I really do miss her. We spent so much quality time together as mother and son. The woman who brought me up and made me the man I am today. I had to swallow that guilt because even as I placated her with empty words, even then, I wasn't sure I was actually joking around. I do hope I get to see her again. I have put this off for almost 20 years. Thanks for reading about my fairly entertaining (or so I'd like to believe, anyway) life. Goodbye, friend.
