Nixon, in his role as both Vice-President and President of the Senate in the Presidential election of 1960, had to preside over the counting of Electoral College votes, as Al Gore did in 2000, and, like Al Gore, Nixon knew that his opposition had cheated to win the White House. Rather than challenging the vote count, and weakening the image of the United States in the eyes of the Soviets, Nixon let Kennedy have his day for the sake of America's perceived well being. Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency. Nixon went to China; he was the first President to open diplomatic relations with China after they turned communist. Nixon ended the gold standard. While many economists say we have fiat current, which we do as a result, MOST other currencies are fiat as well! Nixon saw that adhering to gold made us less money, so he did away with the standard. As to Watergate, Nixon officials did not realize they were being recorded and did not hide or anything. they were honest. After Watergate, rather than changing ill-behavior, I would bet most Presidential officials just became better at covering their tracks. Nixon pushed to lower the voting age from 21 to 18, which passed! Nixon's a badass. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
