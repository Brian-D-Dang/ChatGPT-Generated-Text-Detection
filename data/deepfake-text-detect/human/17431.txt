I think if there were a computer out there that's security is unbreakable and logic infallible, only looked out for the betterment of humanity, ensuring everyone was treated equal and fairly and did nothing but make goals to achieve those objectives then it should rule the world. I also think that with the level of technology we have we would be able to set up like a "cyber bill of rights" that were similar to the "three laws of robotics" (similar as far as how the CPU obeyed them) then a lot of negatives of having a CPU rule what significantly decrease. Also I would like to add that we, as in all of the people in the world no matter criminal history or nationality would be able to vote on being able to accept what laws the world would follow when the grand master CPU would try and push a law through. My logic to think this is: CPU has no personal goals or agenda, meaning it cannot be corrupted If the bill of rights were protected and we all had a say then we would all live in a more united type of world The only laws being past for any reason are for the betterment of humanity and the well being of everyone Quality of life for everyone would be improved in the long run going with the logic that without extreme luxury for the few there is basic equality for all. Space n shit.
