First let me clarify the flavor of abortion that I'd like to discuss. There are a few cases that I don't want to get into a) I am not talking about when a women is raped and b) I'm not trying to discuss when there are mentalphysical health related issues. These are extremely difficult decisions that I personally don't even know how I would handle, so to pass judgement on them seems hypocritical. I am more specifically looking at 2 consenting adults having sex and they conceive a child together. You were drunk, I don't care. Your condombirth control failed, I don't care. I realize that children can fuck up a lot of things that wereare planned in your life, but does that mean that abortion is the option? Everything that we do has consequences and sex is just another one of those things. If you come into work drunk, you'll probably get fired (Cause and effect). If you have sex, no matter how well protected you are, you may get pregnant. I'm a strong proponent for adoption. I have 3 adopted younger siblings and my wife and I are looking into adoption as well. I know the system is flawed, and that some kids get put in a bad situation or are bounced around and suffer because of this. Yet I just can't get the thought out of my head that someone's best friend or the next bill gates was just terminated before they were even given a chance. Conversely I suppose the next jack the ripper is also possible. Still I believe that the benefits outweigh the potential harm. change my view Edit: First sorry for the poorly worded title. Second I suppose the issue comes down to when is a zygote no longer a zygote and now a child. I was trying to make it more cut and dry than it is. Ultimately we all have to choose when (with our vote) this transition occurs. Just because my view is that conception starts the childs life does not mean that is your view. That is fair and you all have changed my view.
