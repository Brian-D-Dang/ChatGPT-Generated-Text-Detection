Edit 1: I said "investment" but not in the sense of wanting something out of the car when sold. I meant like it's a bad choice to spend money on cars because of the reasons given. EDIT 2: My opinion has been changed! I now see that they're worse ways to spend money. And now realize that it's actually not that hard to maintain a car. Thank you all for your very well thought out responses! EDIT 3: Just to clarify, where I live I rarely hear of car theft, I was just saying it could happen at any moment. Like anywhere in the world where there is crime. Just to clarify I like cars. I consider them necessary evils. They break down, require constant maintaining, contaminate the environment, can get stolen, etc. On that last note, the amount of cars stolen everyday is absurd. And on top of all of this, even if you have let's say a new car that doesn't require that much maintenance as an old one. At any given moment, someone or something could hit it, scratch it or downright destroy it! When it comes to car accidents, I believe it not a question of "if" it's more a question of "when." I take care of my car, and sure enough a few months ago a person hits me out of nowhere, and just yesterday I almost got hit again! And even worse still is the fact that at any given moment, someone could come and take away all your hard work and money invested into your car!
