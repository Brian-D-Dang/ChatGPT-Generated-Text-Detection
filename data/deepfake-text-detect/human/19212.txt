Update: A lot of commenters have taken this to mean that I believe our government is a vast conspiracy. That's not where I'm going with this. I'm simply saying for things like floor speeches in congress, presidential speeches, TV interviews, etc., the objective isn't to convince fellow legislators of the merits of their perspective, they are there to play to their audience (typically their constituents, both financial and democratic). I see this as why if you watch clips from people giving floor speeches in congress, there's nobody in the chamber but the person speaking and maybe a handful of others. Nobody in power cares about what is actually said in that specific forum. Everything real happens behind closed doors. I see more House of Cards and less Illuminati. I believe that everything that happens on the floor of congress, in a press conference, a public committee meeting, or a speech has been discussed at length prior with all involved parties (including adversaries). That there are few, if any, genuine surprises that aren't the result of outside events. I believe that everything that actually matters happens in closed door meetings that are determined by what each participant can get away with or do for their respective constituencies (and not all the residents necessarily, just those that represent their political base). I once heard a lawyerly phrase: never ask a question you don't know the answer to. Give me some hope in our system. CMV.
