What do you mean last longer? That you can smell it for longer? I would suppose it doesn't last longer and any perception of that is created by the fact that most other places are covered with clothing or it is caused by proximity to our noses. It's easier to catch whiffs of our own wrists and neck than our stomachs and ankles. As far as other responders referring to "pulse points" I'd direct them to [this article] (URL0) in hopes of stopping the further spread of misinformation.','People apply perfumes to pulse points because (at least in theory) these areas of the body are warmer, thus allowing volatile oils contained in the perfume to be released.
