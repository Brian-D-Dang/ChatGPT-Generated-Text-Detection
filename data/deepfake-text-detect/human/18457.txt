Movements like this that encourage people to contact legislators en masse are rarely, if ever, impactful. The political wheels will keep turning and there will be hardly a hiccup in the system. Most legislators want to appeal to their benefactors and donors moreso than their constituents. In addition, the government wants this power; why else would they allow it to grow to this extent. And while some may pretend they are fighting against it they know that the changes that people want take forever to happen, if they even happen at all. Our government had to shut down last year because they couldn't balance their budget, one of the most essential functions. Why do you think they will put so much more effort into curbing the NSA?
