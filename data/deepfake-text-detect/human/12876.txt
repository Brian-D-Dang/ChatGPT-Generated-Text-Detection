America gain unprecedented territorial gains this week against Germany, following a series of skirmishes that took place over the past two hundred years. "This success couldn't have been possible without the contributions of our scouts," Consul Washington said to reporters. "The discovery of gunpowder in an ancient ruin allowed us to sweep aside enemy swordsmen effortlessly. I have great confidence that this technological advancement will allow us to do great things." While things heat up in the American-German War, another storm is brewing in the north. Details are scarce, but rumors are swirling that the Indian Empire has launched strikes against allies and enemies alike. Such stories conjure memories of the reign of terror spearheaded by Montezuma which lasted seven hundred years. America's attention, however, remains fixated on Germany. After losing gem deposits and gold mines and with American soldiers pushing ever closer to Berlin, it remains to be seen if Lord Bismark will sue for peace.
