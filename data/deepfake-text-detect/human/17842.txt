I understand that some executions are going to come from horrible peoplegroups and that I'd run the risk of suffering an even worse deathpossibly torture but when I see one person shooting a whole line of people I would turn around and fight the person. You're already faced with death and you're either going to die waiting to get hit in the back of the head so why not fight? Even if it doesn't work out, you were going to die anyway. I know there are countless different scenarios people can be faced with but I feel like I'd try and fight for my life, especially if it's one person with a gun who is shooting 8 people in a row. Of course there are probably other factors I'm ignorant too as well but I'm open to any arguments so go ahead, CMV! Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
