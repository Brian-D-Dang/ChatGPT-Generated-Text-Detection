I have heard the usual argument about demand and supply, but it still feels unjust that some people who are good at completely inconsequential stuff are paid many times more than the doctors, scientists and engineers who contribute much more to the society. I know it is private money but are we so enthralled by profits that we throw the worthiness of it to the wind? I think it shows that there is something wrong with our cultural values and our priorities that we are willing to throw millions of dollars at sports persons Edit: 1) Okay a few things here. I am questioning the worth of sports person when they play sport. Giving me examples of sportsmen who were also good human beings doesn't count. That is their worth as a sport man and their celebrity status helped them do more good than other. Where exactly did making a goal or scoring a homerun feature in their contributions? 2) Second, I'm not saying that we should stop fun and entertainment, nor am I suggesting that we should enforce rules to make private citizens not pay money to sportsmen. My only argument was that there is a problem, I don't have solution. Edit 2: Thanks for all the replies. Most of the arguments were about supply and demand, which wasn't the point of my post at all. However there was some illuminating comments on the social worth of sports. While I am still not convinced, I think the subject isn't as clear cut as I believed. PS: And I'm not talking just about the US. There are people from other countries too here you know. Please don't make your reply US centric
