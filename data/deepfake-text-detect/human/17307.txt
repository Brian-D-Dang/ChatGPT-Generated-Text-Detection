I'm always told that guys and girls can be just friends, and they give some really nice examples but it basically boils down to two things in my head: 1. The sexual attraction hasn't happened yet. 2. One of the two is gay. Because in my head, we as mammals HAVE to breed to survive and it's been that way for a really long time, so it's just something that comes naturally. Males seek females and vice versa. We can't control it. So if someone says they have a friend of the opposite gender and they're single and straight, it's just a matter of time. I strongly want someone to prove me wrong, because I want to have a friend who is a female. Just as a friend. Past mistakes from my own personal experience and from the experience of fellow peers have proven my current view correct.
