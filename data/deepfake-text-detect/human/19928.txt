Short explanation: I have terrible memory for directions so I prefer to use my GPS to get around, even for short trips that are to places I've never been to before. My mother gets upset every time I have to do this (I have gone down the wrong road when trying it her way of no GPS before). I'm trying to see it from her viewpoint but I can't find any good reasons that this is really that big of a deal. So go ahead everyone: Change My View!
