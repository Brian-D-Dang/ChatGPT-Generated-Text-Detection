I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost cheating to call these things elements and add them to the periodic table. The atoms are created in a lab, usually by slamming two other heavy atoms together in a collider. The resulting atom decays in microseconds and does not naturally occur outside the lab. Calling these things new elements strikes me as the same thing as grabbing two random objects, (say a water bottle and a book), holding them together in your hands and saying, "Look! I've created a bookbottle!" The object will only last until you let go of it, and then be torn apart by the stronger force, in this case, gravity. It's not a new tool or object and you can't file a patent for it. Ununpentium and its ilk are not elements if they can't be found outside the lab, cannot exist as more than a few atoms at a time, or last more than a few microseconds. They are interesting experiments to be sure, but they are not new elements. Change my view. EDIT: Wow, I really didn't see how many gaping holes my argument had. What I've learned: Short half life It's short by our human standards, but that means nothing on the universal scale. Our lives are nothing on the scale of the universe, that doesn't mean we aren't alive. Very few atoms at a time This is just a limit on what we're able to synthesize. Massive quantities could theoretically be created in a supernova. Not outside the lab. Where it is synthesized doesn't matter. The lab is still in the universe, so it could be said that the universe is creating these atoms. There are lots of convincing arguments here, and I'll respond to all of them and delta the ones I feel really swayed me. Thank you for the discussion.
