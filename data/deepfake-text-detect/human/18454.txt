I don't vote and here's why. Everything I do I think "Is what I'm putting into this worth what I'm getting out of it?" I go to work daily because I'm being paid for my time and it's a salary that is fair. I keep driving my 10 year old sedan because it's in my best economic interest to continue to drive that car, even though I have the money to buy a new car. When it comes to voting I don't see the value. It takes at least 30 minutes of my time to go to the voting location, stand in line, and finally vote. What is my benefit? Would the election result be any different if I did or didn't vote? No. Throughout history the number of elections that were decided by one vote is incredibly low, so I don't invest my time. In summary, the cost of voting isn't worth the minuscule value gained from having my vote counted gained to support the candidate I think should win. Hello, users of CMV!
