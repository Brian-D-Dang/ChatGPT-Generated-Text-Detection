For example, I don't understand why Obama would listen to what Goldman Sachs tell him to do, just because they funded his presidential campaign. Although I agree Fundraisers are totally able to pick up people they believe will work in their interest, once you're elected, why would a president (of the US, nevertheless) do what his fundraisers want him to ? Of course, putting aside the fact you can get assassinated like JFK, which belongs to conspiration theories.
