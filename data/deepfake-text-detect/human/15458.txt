I just wanted to write you to express my extreme disappointment in the Waterfront location. My granddaughter and I bought two mollies last night around 8-8:30pm last night. One of them died over night. When I took the dead fish back to the store to exchange it they gave me a hard time. Saying I needed a water sample. I told them I've bought many fish from them in the past and never had to bring in a water sample to exchange a fish. (I own two fish tanks. One 55 gallon and one 40 gallon). I wasn't asking for my money back, I just wanted another fish. They refuse and the manager walked away from me saying that's our policy. I got my money back for the fish, but they no longer have a customer. I also own a business in Homestead and would never treat my customers that way. Especially if I wanted to keep a good reputation. They have lost a customer who has spent hundreds of dollars at that location over a 4 fish. Here is the fish return policy they have listed online. No where does it say you need a water sample. Petco's commitment to our customers: All freshwater fish purchased at petco.com are guaranteed to stay alive for 30 days from the day they arrive at your home or we will gladly refund your money. All marine species, live rock and plants are guaranteed for 15 days from delivery. I will now have to drive 10 miles out of my way to another pet store, but they will NEVER see another dime from me. Hope that 4 fish that they probably paid 25 cents for was worth it!
