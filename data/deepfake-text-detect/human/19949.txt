The whitespace wars have not subsided. [My opinion aligns with Linus's] (in fact, was probably formed by it): Tabs are 8 characters, and thus indentations are also 8 characters. There are heretic movements that try to make indentations 4 (or even 2!) characters deep, and that is akin to trying to define the value of PI to be 3. My opinion is not about whether to use [hard tabs vs spaces] (FWIW I'm against using hard tabs as a way to accommodate different indentation preferences), but about the meaning of hard tabs. My opinion also does not extend beyond source code or similar monospaced text documents. Change my view! Make me accept that it's okay to write code with hard tab characters making stops at something other than exactly every 8 spaces.
