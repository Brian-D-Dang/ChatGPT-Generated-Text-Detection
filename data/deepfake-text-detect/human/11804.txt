Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for an attack that caused fires at a major oil processing facility and nearby oil field in Saudi Arabia. 10 drones were involved in the attack, which caused the suspension of around half of Saudi Arabia's daily oil production. Houthi rebels have used drones in a number of attacks this year, packing the drones with explosives and then flying them at high speed towards their targets. The group originally used standard, off-the-shelf drones, but more recently they have been using sophisticated models with a range of more than 900 miles. While the Houthi group has claimed responsibility, the US has blamed Iran for the attack. Iran has rejected the accusation. These drone attacks may cost no more than 15,000 each and are incredibly hard to stop, meaning that this attack could change the face of the Yemen War.
