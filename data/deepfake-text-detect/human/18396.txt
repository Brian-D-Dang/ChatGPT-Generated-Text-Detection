If I come to your home and steal your money to pay for my child's healthcare, this is called theft. If the government takes your money to pay for my child's healthcare, it still is theft. If I don't forfeit my salary to the government, they will send agents (or goons) to my home, kidnap me and then throw me in a cell. People tell me it's not theft, because I was born between some arbitrary lines that politicians drew up on a map hundreds of years ago.
