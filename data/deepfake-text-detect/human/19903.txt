We hope you all had fun yesterday, and perhaps even had the chance to see modern issues from another view, thanks to a bit of historical context. We started the day with some posts prepared in advance by the mods, but soon our users jumped on board and made their own posts in the spirit of the unexpected theme. We ended up [filling the front page] with themed posts, most of which came from you guys. We learned a few unexpected things yesterday that we'd like our community to give their opinion on, some of which are: 1. Should we do more "Theme" days? This would be only a couple of times a year, not just on April 1st. 2. Several redditors took the opportunity to try CMVs that were done in-character within a fictional world. Should these be allowed on a daily basis, kind of like Change My View Like IAMA (rexplainlikeIAmA)? 3. We have the ability to switch to a fully curated system, like rAskHistorians and rAskScience, where every post is screened by a moderator first. This can result in a delay between submitting and seeing your post live, but may result in fewer troll posts and repeat topics (within our 24-hour window, that is). 4. How do you think it could have been improved or made more popular?
