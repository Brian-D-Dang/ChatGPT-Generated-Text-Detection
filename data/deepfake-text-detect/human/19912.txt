This applies to any work of art, but I'm focusing on film and TV for simplicity. That is, off-set stuff such as actors dying, overdosing, playing against type, how the director got the job, andor adaptional loyalty is irrelevant to the quality of a film or TV series. None of that stuff matters - all that does is what the audience sees before them. The only exceptions are works that in some way sponsor harmful activity, such as older works that depict animal cruelty. A brief note on why I believe this: Both Firefly and The Dark Knight are critical (if not financial in Firefly's case) successes that I believe are somewhat overrated due to early cancellation and the death of Heath Ledger respectively, taking good or even great works and inflating them to ridiculous levels of popularity.
