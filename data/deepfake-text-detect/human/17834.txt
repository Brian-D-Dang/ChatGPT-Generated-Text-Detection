1. "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Having the IRS deem which churches should get support of the state and not taxed is directly against the Constitution. This is directly respecting a religion. 2. Non-profits books are required to be public knowledge. Church IRS filings are closed book. There should be no discrepancy. All non-profit filings should be open for all. 3. Standard non-profits must file a detailed report (called a 990) that indicates where all money has gone. Churches are waived from this requirement. 4. Taxing churches would add billions of dollars to the economy. One such number quoted is 71 billion USD per year. 5. Churches have been recently accused of telling parishioners to vote for X politician, which is expressly forbidden for any non-profit.
