I hold this view because I see a lot of people born wealthy and are now successful, but aren't aware of how their privilege sets them up to do so. "Privilege-checking" implies that any activity tainted by the unequal distribution of freedom to participate in it is "inherently bad" and should not be done, lest you "enact privilege" upon others. For example, traveling the world on your parents' dime, getting a job because of nepotism, etc. I know that this is probably not entirely correct, and I'd like to hear some of your viewpoints, especially because it's impossible to divorce from the way you were born and raised. Change my view!
