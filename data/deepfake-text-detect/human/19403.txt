I've been to casinos and tried to enjoy myself. However, I can't avoid the notion while playing the games that they're nothing but shallow trappings on top of, "you lose 55 of the time, you win 45 of the time," and that just doesn't seem fun to me. It's not even like the mechanics are well-hidden - it's just giving my money away slowly, and even when I win, it's not because I made the right move, it's just dumb luck, and the best move was always not to play. I also tried once taking a different perspective on it, and going in thinking about it in terms of setting aside X dollars to buy entertainment, and expecting to lose it. However, that didn't end up fun for me either, it's just giving my money away slowly while playing a thinly disguised version of, "55 of the time you lose, 45 of the time you win." I suppose at its heart, playing a game that is rigged against me where whether I win or lose I inevitably lose in the long run just doesn't feel fun. Instead, I feel like a chump, and it seems so much more fun to play as the house. Is it that all the trappings are just much more appealing to others than they are to me? If I were to offer a home version of 55 of the time I win stripped of all the trappings where I just roll dice and 55 of the time players have to pay me, somehow I don't think even my friends that are into gambling would find that very appealing. So in net, I don't find casino gambling appealing at all. CMV Oh, and let's limit this discussion to games of pure chance, such as slots or blackjack, where even at maximum skill if you don't cheat the odds dictate you'll lose money in the net. I could readily imagine if I were to get super good at poker, that it'd be fun to go and play and win.
