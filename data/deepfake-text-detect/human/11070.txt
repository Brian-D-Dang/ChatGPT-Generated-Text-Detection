The CPU is your computer's main processing center and handles the majority of the work involved with running the game. Things like running the game engine, responding to input, loading the next level are all done by the CPU. However, it offloads the significant task of graphical processing to the GPU, a specialized piece of hardware designed to take virtual geometry and translate it into pixels to display on the screen. So when you tell your character to move in your game, the movement is handled by the CPU, it tells the GPU what to draw, and the GPU calculates how to draw it to the screen.," "If you need to do the same calculations a bazillion times (how does this light impact pixel 1, how does this light impact pixel 2, how does this light impact pixel 3), it goes on the GPU. If you only need to do it a handful of times each frame (which direction should the enemy on screen move, did that bullet hit kill the enemy), it's done on the CPU.
