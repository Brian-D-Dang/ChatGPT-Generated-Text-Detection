The reason I say this is because making those words forbidden only adds to their power, meaning that when they are used it is that much more effective. By using them in a casual way (not as an insult, but in a way similar to how people used to say "that's so gay we send the message that it really isn't a big deal, which allows the word to slowly fade away from its original meaning to the point that it doesn't really have anything to do with what it once did. The main thing that I draw from for this view is the word cunt. This is a pretty common insult where I used to live, though not as much in the U.S.; it basically just means jerk, and calling someone a cunt has little to do with female genitalia. If we manage to do this with words like nigger than it doesn't have to be associated with the thing it was originally connected with; in other words, it's just a generic insult that doesn't necessarily have to be associated with that group, like the word "jerk." This isn't a view that I strongly hold, and I am fairly open to it being changed and look forward to hearing what all of you have to say in this matter. Thank you in advance to everyone who posts.
