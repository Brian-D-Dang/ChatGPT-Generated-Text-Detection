I feel that many of the default subreddits are far more plagued by people calling out reposts than they are by the actual reposts. I've only been a redditor for four months, and I know that doesn't make me any kind of veteran, but an overwhelming majority of the posts which I see are entirely new to me. And when the time comes that I see an unoriginal post, I don't freak out. For example, on the front page today was a post about how [Sweden exports their trash to Norway.] I saw the very same post a month or two ago. So what did I do? Did I call OP a fag? Did I throw out a chart showing how many times it's been posted? Did I even downvote it? No, I did none of those things, because I am not the internet. I'm just one dude. To think that because I saw something one month ago that nobody is allowed to enjoy it today is astonishingly arrogant. The reason a post makes it to the front page is because people vote it there. If it didn't deserve to be there, it wouldn't be, because the number of upvotes would be insufficient. Also, I find the expectation of consistent original content to be ludicrous. This website has millions of subscribers, many who post content, and a front page of 25 posts which can be expected to be completely swapped out within an hour, every hour. I feel that if you're expecting a wealth of original facts, jokes, and pictures at all hours of the day, from a dynamic website with a growing population, you're expecting far too much out of the internet. So, why should I hate reposts? Why do you? Is OP really a fag after all? Change my view.
