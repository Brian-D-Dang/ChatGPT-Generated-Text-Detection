I am non religious and am curious about religion. Im happy and I feel very well rounded as a person. I dont think I need spirituality. I can see why it would be helpful to others but I dont think there is any form of spirituality that is either compatible with me or helps me at all. Im a happy, godless nihilist at the moment. Im open to ideas though.
