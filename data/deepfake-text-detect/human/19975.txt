Unpaid internships are becoming an increasingly divisive political issue these days, but I really don't understand the argument against them. People make a voluntary choice to work for a company for free, so as to gain employable skills. One could potentially argue that such a choice would not be in their best interests, and as such the government should step in to protect these people from themselves. Here's where this argument breaks down however. "Society" has a problem with allowing people to labour in exchange for experience in lieu of money at a private corporation, but this same "society" has no problem at all with letting young, naive, and vulnerable teens go thousands of dollars in debt to work for experience in lieu of money in university. This is compounded with the fact that university students often work on things like Medieval Poetry or Gender Studies that provide no benefit (and considerably less than no benefit when you factor in opportunity cost) on the employment market. Allowing students to go to university in non-employable fields is considerably more exploitative than allowing them to do unpaid internships where they will be learning employable skills, CMV.
