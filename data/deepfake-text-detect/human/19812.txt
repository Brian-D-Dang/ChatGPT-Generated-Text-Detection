I have been using a straight razor for 6 years to shave my face andor shape my facial hair. When I first started shaving, my grandfather taught me how to shave properly using a safety razor. I have used disposable razors or razors that use disposable cartridges before, but I've found that they are less comfortable and they don't get as close of a shave at all. All of that is simply my opinion. But here's the facts: you are losing a lot of money by not switching to classic shaving. You can buy a Dovo Shavette Straight Razor on Amazon for just under 30.00 and a 100 ct. box of Derby blades to go with it for 9.62. You can use each side of the blade multiple times before it gets dull, and you can soak your blades in baby oil to keep them sharp before you switch to a new one. So for 40, you can shave your face almost EVERY DAY for an entire year this way. The alternative? You can buy a cheap plastic Gillette razor handle for around 15 at your local store and an 8-pack of disposable blades to go with it (which you can only use 1-2 times) for 30 dollars. So for 45 you can get a couple months worth of shaving if you only shave once a week this way. Other than not knowing about this method, I can't see why anyone would CHOOSE to buy low quality disposable razors and razor blade from the store when you can actually save a couple hundred bucks and get a better shave, not to mention shave more frequently whenever you feel like it or the need arises.
