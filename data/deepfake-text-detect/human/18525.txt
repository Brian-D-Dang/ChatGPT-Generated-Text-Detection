I saved money I bought capital I profited (even though it was very likely to fail) Now I have a profitable business model. I hire a worker to run this profitable business model, but I pay them less than what I would make running it alone. Anticapitalists would say this is theft, but I say this is growth, because now the worker can save, and saving is the first step towards fulfilling wants.
