I majored in Computer Science at a large public university. Upon graduation, I had job offers from multiple large companies, and I accepted one for 60kyear to start working within a few weeks of my graduation. Within 2 years, I was able to buy my own home (with a mortgage, to be clear), which I now operate as a rental property. I have remained gainfully employed since, and have increased my salary significantly in the intervening years. Things have not changed that much since 2006. All of these things should still be possible today. I worked hard in high school to gain admittance into a good university in a competitive major that would guarantee me a job upon graduation. Then I worked hard through university to get good grades and build a strong professional network through internships. Now I work hard at my job to continue moving up. I believe that students who have trouble finding jobs when they graduate either did not work hard enough to be competitive in the job market, or chose a major that would not offer strong job prospects upon graduation, and are now experiencing the consequences. What am I missing?
