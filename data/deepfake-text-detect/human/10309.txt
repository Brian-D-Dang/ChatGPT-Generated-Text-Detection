Cutthroat Kitchen is a reality TV cooking show where contestants bid on sabotages to make their competitors fail at cooking the dish that needs to be cooked, and keep the money remaining. Often, this requires picking a competitor who gets sabotaged. E.g. "One of your opponents will give up all their ingredients and have to make their tacos using just what they can recover from this day old salad bar." This view is about what the best strategy for handing out a sabotage is. I think that in the first 2 rounds, when you have a choice, you should always target whoever already has a sabotage. So if someone gave another competitor the salad bar, and then you're handing out who has to give up all utensils for tinfoil, you should always pick the person who got the salad bar. The reason is this: you do not win a round of CTK. You just refrain from losing. Having the best dish is no better than having the second or third best dish in round one. You are best off by trying to guarantee one person fails totally. Because then they go home. Spreading out the sabotages means its less likely that they'll be crippling (since they're tested to be doable). If you pile them all on one person though, it becomes much more likely they'll totally fail, thus saving you. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
