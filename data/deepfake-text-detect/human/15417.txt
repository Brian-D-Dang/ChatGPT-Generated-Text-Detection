Only reason I come here is because I get 5 off the total before 9am on Sunday. This recent experience, they forgot to clean the dashboard (dust, dust and more dust) and I almost drove off with the marker of my wash on my windshield?! Those are the two most important parts to clean after a car wash!!!! If I didn't need to come here, I wouldn't. Plain and simple.
