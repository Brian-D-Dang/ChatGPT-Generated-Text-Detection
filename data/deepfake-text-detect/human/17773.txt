So to be clear, I'll cross the street when there's no crosswalk nearby. I'm talking about intersections with traffic lights and the "do not walk" hand. I live near a smallish city, so there are often times that no cars are coming but the "do not walk" sign is on. People I'm with usually look both ways and then cross anyways, but I wait until I'm legally allowed to cross. My reasoning is that the amount of time I'd save is less than 30 seconds, and the maximum penalty (either being hit by a car or getting a ticket), though rare, is too high to justify such a small amount of time saved. Furthermore, I feel it is wrong to break traffic laws just because you don't think they should apply to you. Lastly, I believe people who break these kinds of safety laws out of habit are more likely to forget to look both ways and put themselves in real danger. I really don't understand why people think it's okay to jaywalk in these situations but in their car they would be much more hesitant to run a red light even if they could see it was clear. It's become an issue with my in-laws, so please CMV. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
