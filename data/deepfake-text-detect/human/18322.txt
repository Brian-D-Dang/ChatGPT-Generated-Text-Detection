Why I hold this view: As far as I know, race does not change a person's psychology, meaning a person from any race can get along perfectly well with a person of any other race. Race is mostly cosmetic and while I know that we are far more influenced by looks than we think, I still feel that it is wrong to judge a person just based on their race. I think it is unrealistic to assume that some people are simply not attracted to people of different races. If two people who have a genuine connection and would otherwise date (removing familiarsocietal pressures which I understand can be some people's reasoning), it is ridiculous of them to not date simply because they belong to different racial groups. I know that this isn't really 'that big of a deal' we're not talking about not hiring people of a different race or not voting for candidates of a different race but I still think that this is a form of discrimination and is wrong. Also keep in mind that culture race. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
