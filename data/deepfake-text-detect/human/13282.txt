"Hey buddy, do you have the time?" It took me a moment to realize that the man sitting next to me was talking to me. It took me another moment to process what he said. "No man, sorry. My watch doesn't work." I leaned forward and showed him my watch, which was currently translated about 5 centimeters above my wrist. It appeared to be floating in mid-air, as if wrapped around an invisible wrist. It also failed to show the correct time. "W-what..... What the fuck...?" "Sorry. I really need to get it fixed." The man quickly got up and re-seated himself far away from me. I was kinda hurt. It's not my fault that my watch fails at everything. I reexamined my watch and found it was wrapped around my wrist once again, but now the leather strap and watch face had caught fire. I patted the fire out and looked around. The entire bus was staring at me. "What?" I asked, angry that I was getting all this attention over a broken watch. Everybody stopped staring, My wrist felt wet, and I realize my watch had melted again. This was the 5th time that my watch had done this today. The woman across from me was horrified. I gave her an angry glance and she looked away. "This fucking watch..." I muttered, "It can't fucking do anything right!" The bus stopped and I realized that this was my stop. I took off the watch, which now appeared to be emitting Cherenkov radiation, and threw it to the ground, where it burst into flames once more. I quickly made my way off the bus. As I stepped onto the pavement, A passenger screamed.
