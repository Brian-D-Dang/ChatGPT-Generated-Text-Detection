We've seriously done something with his family for the past 3 weeks and the holidays aren't even upon us. Some notes: 1. His Grandma has begun cancer treatment for a mild form of skin cancer and our entire month was revolved around seeing her. 2. The cousin who's all about not vaccinating her children will be there and it takes every bit of strength not to call her stupid to her face. I feel like his parents don't understand that we're adults who work full-time 5 days a week with responsibilities outside extended family. Edit: Fiance also does not want to go. He agrees that it's best for a mental health day before the holidays where we'll be with family. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
