When I first discovered Reddit, it dragged me into all-new amazing content (when I had my first account a year ago). All the default subreddits that were attached with my account were great too. After awhile, these main subreddits provided me nothing useful except entertainment (with a few exceptions). I started to realize that many of these main subreddits I could live without so I started researching into more smaller subreddits. A lot of these smaller subreddits provided me with more educationaluseful information. Of course, my entertainment needs can be fulfilled with other choices besides Reddit, but I think Reddit is a useful tool for educating one's self. To make a long story short, I think Reddit should allow new users to choose default subreddits on their own besides getting sucked up into main subreddits. Please share your views! Thanks! Sorry for any grammar errors will fix if spotted. EDIT: I also should mention that the largest subreddits are only that way because they are defaults. That is not really fair to lesser subreddits. It should all be an equal choice between what the user can choose. Now, that is not to say that subreddits like rfunny, rpics, rvideos, etc would not be popular, it would allow more users to expand to the far corners of the website. TL;DR Reddit should make subreddits the users choice be default besides automatically subscribing them to the main ones.
