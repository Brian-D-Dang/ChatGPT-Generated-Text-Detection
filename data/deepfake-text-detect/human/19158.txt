From my understanding after reading stories from numerous stories (I haven't actually frequented a gay bar myself due to lack of willing peers) that straight people are actually harmful at gay bars. The straight women go to avoid being hit on my straight men and to view the spectacle of gay men and women interacting. The straight men go to prey on unsuspecting straight women. And both the straight men and women will usually get insecure andor insulted if a gay man or woman tries to hit on them. It seems unfair for gay men and women to have to deal with this in a place that is made for them. edit: People seem to think that because I think that something should apply to one situation, it should be applied to all situations, which somehow leads back to racial segregation or not liking black people. I don't that way and just want to apply this to straight people in gay bars. Nothing else. edit2: My views have been changed.
