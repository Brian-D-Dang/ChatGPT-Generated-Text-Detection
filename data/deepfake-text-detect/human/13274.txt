We were young. And knew not (initially) the effect we would have on one another. Every great love story ended with ' happily ever ', and, possessing such naivete, I was certain as we touched for the first time, this is the only partner with whom I would reach the ' after '. We would remain through jubilation, lamentation, and boredom. I would reach for her in the darkness and find her in the light, but nothing held the failing radiance of the sun like her face. Every time we met at that magic hour, I looked on her anew, as if it was the first, nay, the last time. Hers was the voice that sang me lullabies, brightened my eyes, sharpen'd my wit against the world's cynicism and dullards. Friends noticed a welcomed change in me whilst in her company. It was obvious I was a man in love. And when I fell, it was deep. Each morning my body mourned her valediction. I physically yearned her presence, and with growing toleration she obliged. The variance of my daily processes dwindled in anticipation of our ensuing rendezvous. She " was always on my mind ." I have finally reached our ' after ', and one would not expect less of such an enduring love. Entangled in a grotesque mass of steel and glass and blood, hers and mine, I still reach for her, cradling her cold neck, and kiss her for the last time as the spirit leaves her body and mine. Before departing this world, our picture was taken, a testament to our will and commitment to one another. We were still young, and we are slowly finding out the effect we have on one another. But together we'll live forever, at least our final kiss, always tattooed with the letters " M.A.D.D. "
