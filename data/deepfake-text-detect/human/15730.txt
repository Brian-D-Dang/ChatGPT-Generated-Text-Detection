This place was just okay for me. It was nothing spectacular and there weren't fireworks on my tongue haha I have gone to the one in central park in new york and I remember that one being real good. So, I was very excited when I heard one had opened here! When I looked at the menu, it was similar to that of new york. The average price of a burger is 6-10. The shakes are around 5. When I had arrived, I was expecting some what of a line but I seriously just walked right on up to the register and ordered our burgers. Some of the burgers have a shack sauce that reminded me of in n out, but this sauce is much saltier than I remember. Nothing beats the in n out secret sauce Overall, the burgers we got basically tasted like something that I could have concocted at home. Just cook some meat, fry some bacon, melt some cheese and voila! You have a shake shack burger. The sauce was salty and I felt it had overpowered the taste of my burger. I had to drink two cups of Dr pepper to help with it. The krinkle fries were good tho! You can't mess up potatoes! Oh, my friend got a strawberry milkshake that was OK too. I wasn't too impressed so I may only return to see if my first experience was just bad or if a friend forces me.
