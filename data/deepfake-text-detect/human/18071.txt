Throughout my life, through my school years and post-school I've found that the laziest person in a class or in a job is always black. Not every black person is like this, however a significant majority of the ones I've seen are like this share a sense of entitlement laziness; not only that but they're always the loudest on the buses, trains streets, they disproportionately cause a massive amount of crime, pop out too many kids and a massive minoritymajority of them live off the state compared to their other ethnicity counterparts. No matter which country they are in, we hear the same thing. They receive massive steps up in terms of positive discrimination from universities, schools and governmental organisations yet their culture remains lazy, workless and toxic.
