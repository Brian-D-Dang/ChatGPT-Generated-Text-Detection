Aevum is a startup with an uncrewed aircraft that can take small payloads out to space. The aircraft doesn't use any groundbreaking technology, and it looks similar to existing jet aircraft. Dubbed Ravn X, the vehicle is 80 feet long with a 60-foot wingspan, with a maximum weight of 55,000 lbs, including the payload. It can get small satellites into orbit in as little as 180 minutes. Using traditional jet fuel, Ravn X can take off and land in virtually any weather on any one-mile stretch of traditional aircraft runway. Aevum already has paying customers, including over 1 billion in US government contracts. Images of the vehicle, as well as a 54-minute presentation by Aevum, are available in the article.
