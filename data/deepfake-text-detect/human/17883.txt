I read a blog today about a woman who was 20 weeks pregnant with twin girls, but aborted them anyway because "she already had daughters." The author of the blog was at the Planned Parenthood counseling people, and offered the woman help, had people step-up to adopt them, and the woman still aborted her twins. And it made me sick to my stomach. Regardless of how "legitimate" this blog post was, that is a very real, everyday scenario that happens in the United States, not just at 20 weeks, but even later. I believe, unless there is medical evidence to suggest the mother has a likelihood of not surviving labor, this type of situation should be illegal, with absolutely no other exception. CMV.
