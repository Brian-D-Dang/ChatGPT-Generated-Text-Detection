Recently, the TIDALforAll campaign has swept Twitter following the release of Jay-Z's new music streaming service, TIDAL. Browsing the comments sections on various news websites, there were mixed responses. A lot of people think that TIDAL is a good service- essentially, it's a way for artists to share music directly through a subscriptive service (there is no free option- 10month for regular quality, 20month for CD quality sound), rather than have to go through a recording label and give huge portions of royalties to these massive corporations. However, most of the artists affiliated with the service are already extremely rich. Jay-Z is a billionaire, and a corporation owner to boot, and most of the artists who came out in support of the service are multimillionaires themselves. In the modern era, people can get most music for free. Making music available only as a paid subscription will only serve to increase piracy. Railing against the mindset of free music will only serve to hurt Jay-Z's brand, especially in a time when the "rich vs. poor" mentality has permeated U.S. culture. What do you think, Reddit? CMV!
