That's because of [vote fuzzing] (URL0). It's a way for reddit to conceal the true number of votes a post has received, in order to hamper spam bots. The number of votes on a very popular post is different from what the page says, but the ratio of upvotes to downvotes is accurate.,All I know is that commenting here in reddit has made me realize everyone hates me.', "Nah. There's a vote fuzzing system to defeat bots trolling reddit. The vote up total is real enough, but the up down vote totals are false. If the post is 900 then it is, but the display could read 3,000 up and 2,100 down.,I think people on reddit crave fresh material, and even though they may love puppies, they are frusterated by the massive popularity of a post so nearly identical to countless ones before it. No shame though, Ill upvote some puppies any day of the week.
