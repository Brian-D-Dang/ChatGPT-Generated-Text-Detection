I'm not against tipping, but it's gotten out of hand and expected by almost everyone. I'm a makeup artist, and sometimes I get tips, but it's not something I have ever suggested or expected. I'm hired to do a job at a certain rate, and to rely only on tips would be ridiculous. The times I don't feel like I need to tip are nail salons, Starbuckscoffee shop, valet parking and take out food. If I feel the job was done well and exceeded the job description, I will tip. If it was just what I expected, then I pay for my service I asked for and leave. I don't feel bad necessarily, but I know that I have a different view than a lot of people. I've worked retail, coffee shops, and food service and still feel this way. Change my view.
