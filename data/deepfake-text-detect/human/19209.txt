I want to like Animal Crossing, but i just don't get it. The gameplay is really boring. And the rewards for playing don't seem worth it now that you don't get free NES games for completing activities. And the game seems to not have barely changed over many iterations. Why is Animal Crossing a worldwide juggernaut of a franchise spanning so many platforms and games?
