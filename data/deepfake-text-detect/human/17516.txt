EDIT In addition to diabetics, people on ventilators and dialysis, and people with organ transplants would die relatively quickly. There is nothing to be done for these people. For this view, I'm simply looking at Type I diabetics. It is estimated that 1 of the US population is a type I diabetic, so 3 million people. Without an industrial system to make the insulin they need, they will all be dead within days or weeks. It is impossible to manufacture insulin outside of the industrial system. The history of type I diabetics before the modern times has been that they simply die as they slip into a diabetic coma. Is there any way to manufacture insulin outside of an industrial system? If not, then I think 3 million type I diabetics will be dead within weeks of a total industrial collapse.
