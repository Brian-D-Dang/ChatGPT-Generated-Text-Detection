This comment below sparked me to make this CMV which is a opinion I share I would like to hear opposing opinions and hopefully see more of both sides of the story and most importantly change my view. " There is no single industry I detest in the world like the celebrity industry. How the fuck is an entire industry built on just following people around, invasion of people's lives and generating gossip? "Find out what X did" or "are X and Y getting a divorce" or "has X gained 2 ounces?" Whenever TMZ or Entertainment Tonight comes on, or when I spot those mags at the cashier when buying groceries, my blood just fucking boils. It has to be the lowest of the low of any profession. There is zero dignity. I hope that I'm wrong and someone changes my view, but I cannot respect the professions in that industry.
