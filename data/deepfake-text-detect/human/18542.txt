I am not saying LGBT civil rights and other orientation rights are not important. I am not saying civil rights between races is not an important fight that doesn't need to be continued. However, I do think that people force these movements to be almost the entirety of their identities, and force these issues to be the greatest battles of our day and age, when I honestly think they should not be. In an era where ultra-secret cabinets are formed to govern entire nations and those nations are indebted to a few private shareholders of private banks, I honestly don't care about ultra-liberal views about 'white privilege' and how I should be ashamed to by my race. In world where Palestinians live in a modern apartheid state and the world silently condones Israel's actions, I don't particularly care about appropriation and cultural Marxism. In a world where all media lies to citizens' faces on behalf of their private owners to cover up their crimes , why should I care about the 'portrayal of beauty' in the media and the eradication of 'fatphobia'? In a nation where the congressional-prison-police complex imprisons us and the police state oppresses us all, is it really that important to debate which culture has been oppressed by the Whites more? To me, to discuss such things with the world in such a state is a sign of privilege and luxury; a luxury, I might add, that we don't exactly have. It is elitist that the perceived greater issue at hand is apparently whether asexuals are accepted or not within the LGBT community. There are much greater, much more pressing issues out there. It may not interest everyone to understand the world, and I agree that it's depressing, but people need to collectively open their eyes.
