I was in on Saturday about 8:30 I didn't get the name of the big blonde women that took my order she reeked of alcohol, wasn't very friendly towards me the customer plus the food was not what I order she told me it was what I ordered I will never come back to Hoosiers cafe ever again PS if I was the owner I would fire her on the spot for disrespecting a paying customer
