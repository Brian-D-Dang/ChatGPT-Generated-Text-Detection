The market spice buffet was one of my favorite buffets in Vegas but this last time wasn't so good. Maybe it was because it was 2PM and the food was sitting there for awhile but everything I grabbed was dry. I grabbed one plate and that was enough for me. Luckily, I had the 24 hr pass so I saved my stomach for Caesars that night....
