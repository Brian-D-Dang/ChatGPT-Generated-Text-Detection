Virus scanning is an important thing for your windows computer. Some companies that write virus scanners do it in a very intrusive, heavy handed manner. They often have installation routines that make it difficult to turn off. Their code is often bloated and filled with cross promotional stuff to other things that bog your machine down. You can get just as effective (more?) for free without the bloatware.','Aside from it being a mediocre (at best) anti-virus software, McAfee is well-known for being bundled with Adobe Flash and being very annoying to remove.
