Title sums it up. It's petty drama, it's obvious staging, just... everything about it is so... pandering. It's as though it's made to entertain those with the lowest IQ by seeing a big tough men get tossed around to satisfy our neanderthalic history of violence when we were cave men. Can't stand it, and when I meet someone who enjoys it, I instantly assume they're an unintelligent brute with no appreciation for intelligent, quality entertainment.
