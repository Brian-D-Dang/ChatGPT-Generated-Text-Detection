This review is solely for the food court. After shopping, my family wanted to grab some quick munchies to satisfy the hunger. We headed over and noticed they had some dim sum. Great! Or so we thought. I stood staring at the cashier for a good 5 minutes, I was ready to just leave, but my dad was set on getting dim sum. After getting the cashier's attention by knocking on the glass, she finally took our order. We only wanted to get 2 pieces of sesame balls, 2 pieces of fried shrimp balls, and an order of shu mai. The lady told us that 1 order of shrimp balls comes with 3 pieces, so we took that. We then proceeded saying we wanted 2 PIECES of sesame balls, she started grabbing 3-4 and I stopped her saying no I only want 2 pieces she then starts saying TWO IS SIX. I then told her I'll just have 1 order since I figured one order is 3 pieces. She then gave a horrible attitude and THREW the sesame balls back into the tray. Overall Service: 0 stars After I ate the food it was sub par at best. the shu mai and sesame balls were fine, but the fried wonton chips on the shrimp balls were stale! Food: 3 stars I understand these Chinese places generally have bad service, but I would have rather had no service than this horrid service. I highly do not recommend eating anything at the food court. Just shop and move along folks.
