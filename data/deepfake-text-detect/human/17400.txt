The frontpage of reddit simultaneously reflects two things. 1) Celebration of the legalization of marijuana 2) Denigration of cigarettes and the people that smoke them The latter category of popular posts includes those about laws that make smoking extremely difficult or prohibitively expensive. The justification is that people should be forced to stop smoking because it's bad for them. The former category of posts includes those about laws that make marijuana smoking easier. The justification is that people should be free to choose their favorite method of relaxation, and that weed is no more harmful than cigarettes or alcohol. The freedom argument isn't applied to cigarettes, and the health argument isn't applied to marijuana. THERE ARE NO CONCLUSIVE SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THAT DEMONSTRATE THAT CIGARETTES ARE LESS HEALTHY THAN MARIJUANA OR VICE VERSA. Indeed, such a study would be impossible to conduct, given the breadth of factors and difference in individuals. The difference between them is an entirely illusive one, yet the groupthink believes strongly in the denigration of one and the celebration of the other.
