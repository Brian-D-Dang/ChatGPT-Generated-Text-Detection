I was there on a Sunday afternoon when it was dead and the service was horrible. After receiving my food I had to wait 10 minutes for silverware while my food got cold all the while watching the wait staff stand around and do nothing. Instead of tending to my table my server was behind the bar making drinks. Managers were walking around but not one stopped at my table.
