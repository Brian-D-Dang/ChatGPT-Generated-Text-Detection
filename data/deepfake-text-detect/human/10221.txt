In the UK we view cruelty to pets as terrible and prosecute and even ban pet owners from keeping them because the pets are vulnerable and cannot regulate their meals and feed themselves. This is exactly the same for children. Parents dictate the child's diet and over feed and choose the wrong food types. If they consistently do this the child becomes obese and this has massive implications for the rest of their lives. Eating habits that have been learnt or not corrected, even right down to "fussy eaters" then gets passed on through generations and is the route cause for a massive percentage of the population. We skim past the obesity argument because we don't want to offend and then because we turn a blind eye nothing gets fixed. Punish and educate the parents just the same as a fat cat owner. Children are more important than pets. Change my view
