I have seen a number of CMV's arguing the opposite view (i.e., that depression isn't real, isn't chemically motivated, shouldn't be treated with drugs, etc.) but I would like to look at things from the other angle. I believe that the number of people suffering from depression is much higher than reported, but, due to stigmas around depression and seeking help in the forms of counseling and drugs, people will often be unaware of their condition or, even if they are aware, decide that they shouldn't attempt to get relief. From what I understand, seeking psychiatric help is voluntary, and requires will on the side of the patient to decide whether he or she wantsneeds to seek help. However, other medical illnesses aren't treated this way; if you go to the doctor for a routine check-up and your cholesterol is high, the doctor will attempt to intervene and the patient is expected to take the doctor's advice. The crux of my view is that I believe the same should be done for mood disorders. Please CMV. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
