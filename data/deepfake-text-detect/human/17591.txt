A lot of people on the internet, especially on Reddit, seem to really like piracy. But as hard as I try, I can't see it as anything other than stealing from people who make content that should be paid for, just like any other product. I've heard the argument that it's more convenient, because TV and movies don't have an efficient way of getting content to their viewers. I don't care if it's not efficient, it's still stealing. Convince me that pirating movies, TV shows, or computer programs like Photoshop is any different than stealing a product from a store. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
