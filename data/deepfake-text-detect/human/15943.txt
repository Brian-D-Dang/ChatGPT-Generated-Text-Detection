The Soulages collection of Italian and French Renaissance objects was acquired between 1859 and 1865, and includes several cassone. The John Jones Collection of French 18th-century art and furnishings was left to the museum in 1882, then valued at PS250,000. One of the most important pieces in this collection is a marquetry commode by the ebeniste Jean Henri Riesener dated c1780. Other signed pieces of furniture in the collection include a bureau by Jean-Francois Oeben, a pair of pedestals with inlaid brass work by Andre Charles Boulle, a commode by Bernard Vanrisamburgh and a work-table by Martin Carlin. Other 18th-century ebenistes represented in the Museum collection include Adam Weisweiler, David Roentgen, Gilles Joubert Pierre Langlois. In 1901, Sir George Donaldson donated several pieces of art Nouveau furniture to the museum, which he had acquired the previous year at the Paris Exposition Universelle. This was criticized at the time, with the result that the museum ceased to collect contemporary items and did not do so again until the 1960s. In 1986 the Lady Abingdon collection of French Empire furniture was bequeathed by Mrs T. R. P. Hole.
