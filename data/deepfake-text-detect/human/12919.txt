I was born into a world toxic from war. There lay on the wastelands a fortress, solitude for all of mankind. A ten by ten cell I call home contains no more then my bed, a few rations and a pen and paper to keep me occupied. I've been on this planet for 18 years and thanks to the generations before me I shall not step foot on it's soil nor eat the fruit it bares. I've only ever heard stories of what this planet resembled before the war. Some days I wonder if life behind these walls is worth living at all. There are few things to do in here to pass time. No rooms are big enough to be active and I'm not a very social person. I've been told I have trouble communicating with others. It's mostly because I don't like anybody. I don't even like myself. I don't understand how anyone can in these conditions. I explore the seemingly endless, repetitive, crowded halls to pass time. It's not a great pastime. But it's better then sitting in a ten by ten all day. While exploring today I came across a dark empty room. There was something different about this room, something eerie. The floors were stained red. Inside was only a tiny safe. On the door of the safe read "exit." It isn't locked. Inside, a gun. I took it and pulled the trigger.
