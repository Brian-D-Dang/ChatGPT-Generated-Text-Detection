It is my observation that the department of justice is corrupt at all levels. It behaves like a criminal cartel whose only goal is to enrich itself and increase its power and influence without regard to the consequences. It mindlessly lashes out at those who it perceives have slighted it (Kim Dotcom, Aaron Schwartz, Mark Emry). It smuggles guns into mexico and enable drug smuggling by making deals with drug dealing cartels. It allows the corporations who pay its political masters to go unpunished for massive and systemic frauds against the American people. The DOJ is not doing what it's supposed to do. It is not fighting corruption as it should it is instead engaged in corruption itself and enabling the corruption of others in spite of it's mandate to fight these things. (I'm sorry if you see this twice, I submitted an incomplete draft earlier by accident.)
