A 33-foot-long 3D printer can build new homes in 24 hours. It is currently building a neighborhood in a rural area on the outskirts of a town in Southern Mexico. The technology could be part of the solution for affordable housing in some of the poorest communities in the world. It is the first time 3D-printed homes have been created at scale. Other attempts at 3D-printing homes have usually been in controlled conditions. The area where the houses are being printed is prone to earthquakes. There were a few delays to the project. It took some time to get government approval for land, and the 3D printer was stuck at customs for three months as the machine was in a brand new category that didn't exist. Vulcan II works by squirting out a concrete mixture. The mixture can be adjusted according to the weather. Local construction workers were hired to complete the parts of the home that couldn't be 3D printed.
