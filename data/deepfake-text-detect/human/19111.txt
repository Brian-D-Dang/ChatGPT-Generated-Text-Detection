I think that when a girl has a broken family, especially no dad or step dad, their values of a family is not as strong as one that was brought up with a dad and mom. I feel like they will always have some sort of hatred towards men because their dad left. I feel like they try to become too independent and feminist. They don't become a partner that shares 5050 of relationships and look at men as more of a way to get stuff for free or paid for. I also feel like they purposely set the standards too high in their male partner so that they will almost never be met and they always have something to complain about have a way out of things. Please reddit, change my view.
