Many airports these days are attempting to become more upscale; there are sculptures and musicians and art and fancy food. In theory this is great! If I'm going to pay more for buying food in an airport, I might as well be paying for something good, right? Problem is, when it goes wrong, I just feel cheated. They should know better! Take Humble Pie. Theoretically a gourmet pizza joint in the Phoenix airport, the pizza they gave me was one of the worst I've had in YEARS. The crust was soggy, the toppings spartan, the sauce sickly-sweet and the greasiness unbearable. When I first picked up a slice, all the toppings promptly fell off. I tried to put the toppings back on, but the greasiness of the pizza left me to eat it two-handed: first a bite of the crust, then a bite of the toppings. Really, even if this place billed itself as a super-cheap pizza joint I'd feel cheated.
