The Nitrogen Cycle: Dead organic matter gets consumed by fungi or bacteria and the waste product as a result of that is ammonia. Another type of bacteria will then consume that ammonia and create nitrite as waste. Then, another type of bacteria will turn that nitrite into nitrate. Nitrate is three Oxygen molecules and one Nitrogen molecule. The last step happens in anaerobic (which means lacking in oxygen) settings - such as deep underground. Certain species of bacteria will take the oxygen molecules out from the nitrate and release the nitrogen molecules as nitrogen gas.
