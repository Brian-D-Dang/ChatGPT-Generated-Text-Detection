So to start, this isn't about gay people being bad parents. I am gay myself and gay people obviously have every right to have a family. However, I feel like going through extreme measures to conceive children that would be biologically "yours" in a gay relationship (or even in straight relationships where conception is not a possibility) is immoral. I think the world is overpopulated enough as it is, and that there are already far too many children who would love a good home. In fact, I would go as far as saying that I think it's shameful that so many people in heterosexual relationships choose to conceive children naturally instead of adoption or fostering. Maybe it's harder to think in those terms when it can be easier to conceive of your own child, but it still seems like a tragedy that so many children grow up being shuffled between foster homes or in poverty while couples go through extreme measures (like hiring surrogates or IVF) to have a child born with their own DNA. I think children without homes should take a much higher precedence for all couples wanting children, and I think it's an embarrassment that most couple only start considering adoption when they have no other options. CMV ETA: Damnit, I should have googled amoral vs. immoral before hitting send. Let this be a grammar lesson for us all The adjective immoral means contrary to established moral principles. Immoral actions are corrupt, unethical, sinful, or just wrong. Amoral means (1) neither moral nor immoral, or (2) lacking moral sensibility. So while immoral and amoral might share a little common ground, there is a clear distinction: immoral things are bad, and amoral things are either neutral from a moral perspective or simply removed from moral considerations.
