So I wish one of these airports I frequent would have a nice mexican restaurant. But that is impossible. Short and sweet: Good: The steak quesadilla was alright. The tacos looked crappy. the burrito seemed nice enough. I enjoyed the marinade for the steak. Eh: Big blue moon beer was 7.50. A decent price knowing you are in an airport Bad: The margaritas are 15! 10 for the house one, that looked pretty weak. I sat at the bar, and I have to say I haven't been appalled by a workermanager in a long time. You know those managers that makes everyone worried and feel uncomfortable as an employee because God forbid you spill a beer or drop a napkin, he's gonna rip your face off! He would compainyellsuper sarcastic remarks to everyone working. And quite loud and openly. He ruined my mood. I really could have enjoyed a beer and decent quesadilla if it wasn't for him.
