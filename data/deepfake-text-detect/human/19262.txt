I love panel shows, but I've noticed a trend, the female guests are rarely funny. This is also true in the stand-up world. Note, I am not saying there are no funny women, just they generally aren't as funny as men. The BBC now has legislation in place that there always has to be at least one female guest in a panel show. I think this is also ridiculous. Most people on the comedy circuit openly admit this, including the women. There are a number of ideas put forward as to why this is the case, yet I just got down voted for pointing this out. Relevant: 'Why there aren't more women on QI'
