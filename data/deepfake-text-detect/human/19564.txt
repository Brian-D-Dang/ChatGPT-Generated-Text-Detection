When I hear someone say they can't wear a perfectly functional item of clothing because it's "last season" it infuriates me. The irony of it is they're afraid to wear something out of fashion because they'll be judged, but consequently I'm judging the hell out of them for being such a sheep. I think the whole concept of "in fashion" is driven by retailers and aimed primarily at female insecurity. Males are becoming more fashion concious I admit but the influence on women can easily be quantified by the variance in numbers of female to male clothing stores. Why are we letting perfectly functional items of clothing sit in closets only to end up either in rubbish piles or to be resold at a premium decades later by hipster vintage clothing stores? Personally, I just wear whatever I feel comfortable in and I like the look of. I never think for a second whether or not it is the socially designated design that society says I should be wearing this year. I'd love for someone to give me one single reason that a certain pattern on a T shirt is in fashion one year but a social faux pas the next? Also, who actually says what is and isn't in fashion? What credentials do you need? A quick look at the high fashion shows displaying catwalk models wearing ridiculous concept outfits doesn't instil one with confidence. Additional LPT for anyone who feels the same as me. Personally, as an affront to the fashion industry I try to as much as possible wear simple one colour shirts mostly white or black, plain chinos or shorts and basic sneakers or boots and in winter I still wear the same plain black hoodie I had in high school. I do this year in year out and thankfully these mainstays never really go in or out of fashion they're just generic. So far it hasn't seemed to affect my ability to attract women or see me ostracised from society.
