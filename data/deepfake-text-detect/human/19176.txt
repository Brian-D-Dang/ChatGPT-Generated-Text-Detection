40 of the US prison population is black. Only 14 of the US general population is black. It has long since been decided (and I agree with this) that a police officer cannot investigate or otherwise harass an individual solely because they are blackthis is considered profiling. However, insurance companies charge different rates for different genders, based on the assumed risks. Males pay more for car insurance, women pay more for medical insurance. The increase in price for males (especially males under 25) has to do with males under 25 being the most represented group in car crashes. Why isn't this considered profiling? Being black doesn't make someone inherently more likely to be criminal on the individual level. Why are companies allowed to assume that being male makes someone a riskier driver? Women pay more for health insurance because of potential concerns involving birth control and pregnancy. Why is this considered, from a legal standpoint, something that the insurer has a right to assume? Why do single women who aren't on birth control have to pay as much as women on the pill who are sexually active, and what right does an insurance company have to know a woman's sexual activity? Why isn't the assumption that all women of child-bearing age can't wait to get pregnant not considered profiling? It all seems very inconsistent.
