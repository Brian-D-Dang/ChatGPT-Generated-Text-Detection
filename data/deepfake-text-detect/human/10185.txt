I was thinking about why we have literature, and what it's purpose is to our society. You could say "entertainment," but I think it's more than just that. Most works of literature have some sort of moral dilemma that questions an aspect of our society. A good piece of writing is designed to make the reader feel empathetic towards the characters, so the events that occur due to the choices the characters make with regards to the dilemma, in the end will suggest to the reader what is right versus what is wrong. I was discussing this with my girlfriend the other day, and we used "To Kill a Mockingbird" as an example. My point was that this book shows (among other things) that racism and prejudice is morally wrong. She argued that this wasn't the intention of the book; the book just addresses the issue of prejudice in a neutral way, and it is up to the reader's internal moral compass to decide whether racism is right or wrong. While it is certainly possible to read the book and not have your views on racism changed, I argue that it was the author's intention to suggest that it was wrong. Here, I extend my argument to the majority of all literature. Great works of literature such as To Kill a Mockingbird, 1984, Catcher in the Rye, etc, are all intended to persuade readers to one side of a moral issue. Over history, stories and literature are a great way of defining what we as a race have defined as right and wrong. CMV! Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
