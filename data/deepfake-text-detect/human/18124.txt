As firearms technology has progressed, the act of hunting as a sport with a gun, in my opinion, holds no merit. With incredibly high tech scopes, suppressors, and camouflage, hunting an animal that does not stand a chance against this technology become incredibly unfair. It's no longer hunting, it's just killing. With a bow and arrow, there is significant skill that is required to not only sneak up on your target, but to subdue is as well. I specify "hunting as a sport" because if your life is at stake, then by all means fire away (at game animals).
