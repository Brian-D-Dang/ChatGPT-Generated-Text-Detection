I recently read a comment on a thread titled [What have you found about a loved one's life while packing their things after they've passed away?] that talked about how a woman who used to nanny for a family was sent money even after the family left the country, but never spent a dime and lived in poverty till she died just in case the family needed it later. [Link to the comment] All the out pouring to how great of a woman she was in reply made me a bit furious. Sure it takes a certain kind of selflessness to do this kind of thing, but in my opinion, the good intent is greatly outweighed by the suffering it causes. She could have spent some of that money on herself, maybe even a small portion to live a better life, its what the family wanted for her. I would feel horrible if I realized the person I thought I was helping wasn't actually getting that help, no matter the cause. It goes the same for older family members that want to stay independent later in life because they don't want to be an inconvenience to the younger generation, even though they end up causing more worry and injuries to themselves because of it. At a certain point, being selfless starts hurting the people around you, especially the ones who love you. I just don't understand why so many people feel like this is an admirable attribute.
