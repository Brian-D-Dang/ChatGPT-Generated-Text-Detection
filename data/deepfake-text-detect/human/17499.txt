I think that the US has gone too far in the direction of democracy, instead of republican government. I think the senate should be chosen by states, like they used to be. If it was, the I think the corruption would be neglible. I also think that using the word democracy instead of republic influences people's views on the government, which is bad. I think pure democracy is bad because it is tyranny of the majority, and has caused the fall of nations. I also think we should follow the roman model (no emperors, of course).
