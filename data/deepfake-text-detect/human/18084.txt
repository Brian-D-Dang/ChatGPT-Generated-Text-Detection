In a number of states, exemptions from child abuse and neglect laws, as well as laws regarding healthcare and vaccinations, exist for religious reasons. [Source.] I'm of the belief that everyone in a secular society should be held to the same standards. Especially when those standards pertain to how you can treat your children. Additionally, religious exemptions, especially from vaccinations, can be harmful to other children as well as your own, if for example they are allergic to the vaccine and are exposed to a non-vaccinated carrier. In short, it damages herd immunity. So I believe that no exemption of that sort should exist. Change my view.
