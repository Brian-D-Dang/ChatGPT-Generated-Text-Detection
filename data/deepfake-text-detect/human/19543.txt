I know that technically each vote has the same weight. However, If I'm leaving in New York, there is no way you can seriously try to tell me that my vote is just as important as someone's vote who lives in Ohio or Florida. Using the electorate college practically disenfranchizes a lot of the country and it is ridiculous it still is in existence. What is wrong with a simple popular vote? Shouldn't that be the determining factor anyway? That way presidential candidates would at least campaign in areas with the most people, instead of campaigning predominately in swing states. I understand the original reason for the electorate college and not a popular vote, "to silence the voice of the uneducated voters" I believe it was. But come on people, how is it at all justifiable that based on where someone lives, there vote can hold significantly more power in determining who the president is?
