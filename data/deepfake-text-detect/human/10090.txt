Please understand that I have no hatred for transgender people, and I will not force this view upon them or anyone. I have rather liberal views, really; I'm ready to accept a lot of things.... But I have trouble understanding the reasoning behind gender dysphoria and all of that. I identify as my biological sex, yet I really feel more'feminine' than'masculine'. Yet I don't really believe in either term due to their outdated definitions and all of that nonsense. I'm not a very spiritual person. And I don't believe in a lot'outside' of what we can percieve. Yes I believe there's more to the world, but I don't believe in anything beyond biological sex. Of course it's not binary. Intersex people very obviously exist, that's just scientific fact. I'm starting to go off topic here, but I'm not sure how to elaborate on all of this. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
