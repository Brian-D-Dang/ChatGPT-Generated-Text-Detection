On an individual level, I strongly believe in balancing budgets and not spending more than you earn. However, the United States has a lot of large scale investments that will pay off in the long term. For example if the U.S. funds the NEA, more money will be spent on public schools, but over time the population will be more educated and able to make more money for the U.S. in return. Also, unlike individual debt, the national debt is owned by many institutions both within the country and internationally, and we can't simply pay it off. I've seen this topic come up more frequently in the news in the past year. Why is this such an issue other than the shock of being a number bigger than most people see on a daily basis? More importantly, how and when do you think this will this become too big of an issue to be ignored?
