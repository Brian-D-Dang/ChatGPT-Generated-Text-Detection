At the end of his life, Joe Paterno was infamously and unavoidably tied to the horrific allegations made against his long time assistant coach Jerry Sandusky. In a very public trial, Sandusky was convicted of 52 counts of sexual abuse against children. Investigations into the behaviors and attacks made by Sandusky revealed that much of the sexual abuse occurred over a long period of time often at and inside the University's facilities. Graduate assistant coach Mike McQuery even reported to Paterno that he had witnessed Sandusky anally raping a boy. In time Paterno did forward the report to his higher ups however the situation was almost completely kicked under the rug. As the unheralded leader of the Penn State campus it was Joe Paterno's joint responsibility to address the Sandusky issue and report it to the proper police authorities. For whatever reason he did not do this. There is no conceivable way that Paterno was completely in the dark in regards to Sandusky. He created a lot of good during his lifetime however in my mind he is guilty of a heinous crime that vastly overshadows any NET good he may have created. Baseball player Alex Rodriguez on the other hand is notoriously known for his use of Performance Enhancing Drugs. With the help of these drugs he became a powerhouse of an athlete capable of putting up incredible batting statistics. Rodriguez and other players' use of PEDs were undeniably responsible for tarnishing the legacy of the sport. I believe both men deserve maligned legacies. However Paterno's actions were the worser of two evils. He was considered an ethical leader to thousands of people. Rodriguez hurt a sport were as Paterno allowed for the actual physical and mental hurt of children and when given a chance to make amends he failed to do so.
