I have a very simple opinion on the NSA: If it doesn't affect me, I don't care. And I don't see why others should. Not to mention the "If you don't have anything to hide" rule. It seems like Americans get so worried about the NSA reading a text about a new girlfriend or something. But why does it even matter? You would never know nor have no way of knowing. You might as well be telling God to stop watching you. Sorry if I come off as agressive, it's just that I've never understood why Americans care so much about being watched. ...CMV.
