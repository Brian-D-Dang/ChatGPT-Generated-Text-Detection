I recently started watching anime and one massive thing I like about it is the fact that I can see so many new original concepts being explored in it. While they have themes they like to wonder back to, I find I like it more the fiftieth copdetective show or business man (like American Restoration) show. It just seems that if only in the TV department, has gotten as lazy as can be to the point they recycle plots. To be clear, I am not talking about the actual 5-star (for a reason) shows like the Breaking Bad and others which I've heard are great, I'm talking just the average, an average production out of Hollywood TV just seems like it has no flair and everything in it has been all done before and better elsewhere, like they don't even try to make great series nearly as often as they should be. So I Hollywood really got nothing to write out or am I just a new zealous convert to anime and overrating it entirely?
