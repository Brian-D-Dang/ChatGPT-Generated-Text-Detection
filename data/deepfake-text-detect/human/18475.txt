I keep hearing people say that to walk on our flag is to walk on everything our country stands for. People typically add something along the lines of "if you don't agree with what our country is about, leave!" Our country is not perfect. To disagree with a corrupt structure is not reason to leave. To fight against what you believe to be incorrect values or systemic oppression does not mean you should not be welcomed in America. The flag represents our country. It is a symbol, no doubt. To some, this is a symbol of joy. To others, it is a symbol of misery. Before we can assume what it means to destroy a symbol, we must first dialogue about what that symbol means for both parties. Making assumptions does not help difficult situations. It only hurts. The more I hear about this flag situation, I feel like it is closed minded people getting mad and jumping to conclusions without trying to talk about things. Change my view, help me see the errors of my ways.
