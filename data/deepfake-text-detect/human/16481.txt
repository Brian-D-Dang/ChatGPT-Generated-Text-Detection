QoS-aware networking applications such as real-time streaming and video surveillance systems require nearly fixed average end-to-end delay over long periods to communicate efficiently, although may tolerate some delay variations in short periods. This variability exhibits complex dynamics that makes rate control of such applications a formidable task. This paper addresses rate allocation for heterogeneous QoS-aware applications that preserves the long-term end-to-end delay constraint while, similar to Dynamic Network Utility Maximization (DNUM), strives to achieve the maximum network utility aggregated over a fixed time interval. Since capturing temporal dynamics in QoS requirements of sources is allowed in our system model, we incorporate a novel time-coupling constraint in which delay-sensitivity of sources is considered such that a certain end-to-end average delay for each source over a pre-specified time interval is satisfied. We propose DA-DNUM algorithm, as a dual-based solution, which allocates source rates for the next time interval in a distributed fashion, given the knowledge of network parameters in advance. To overcome the slow convergence of dual-based DA-DNUM algorithm, we propose another fast alternative solution based on the recently-proposed distributed Newton method. Also, we extend and address the problem in a case that the problem data is not known fully in advance to capture more realistic scenarios. Through numerical experiments, we show that DA-DNUM gains higher average link utilization and a wider range of feasible scenarios in comparison with the best, to our knowledge, rate control schemes that may guarantee such constraints on delay.
