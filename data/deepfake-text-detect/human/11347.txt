Facebook is rolling out its Novi wallet in the US and Guatemala in a pilot program. Users will be able to purchase Paxos Dollar (USDP) using Novi, with Novi depositing its funds with Coinbase. Facebook continues to support its own stablecoin, Diem, and will integrate it into Novi once it receives regulatory approval. Novi and Diem were announced back in June 2019 under different names. The scope of the project has changed since the original announcements due to regulatory backlash.
