the way i see it, adoptive parents want a kid but have to have background checks, tons of paperwork and interviews ect ect before they can even see a kid. meanwhile, any crack addict or teen mom or general drunk, if her parts work, can just get a human life, she could be the worst person in the world but as long as she is physically able she can just have a kid? and that's her right and we can't say boo about it? now this is going to sound very, well, hitler-y, but i think you should need to apply for a license to be able to have a child. you need a license to show you are capable of driving a car but any schmoe can just raise a human? i'm sure you've seen what i've seen, those people out somewhere, screaming at there "little bastards" and you wonder "how can be allowed to be parents?" well i don't thing they should. could my idea get out of hand? sure, but what idea can't go to an extreme? i just think that we as a species need to take more responsibility for what direction we're headed in. the reason i decided to post this is i heard a radio lab program about a crack addict woman who would repeatedly get pregnant, and then just drop off the babies at a hospital and walk way. i believe this happened four times, and since she had crack when she had those babies, as soon as they came into the world the first thing they felt was withdrawal from hard drugs, what a way to start a life, or four.
