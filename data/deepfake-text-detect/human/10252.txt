You may have seen news that BlackLivesMatter protesters interrupted a Bernie Sanders campaign event in Seattle. I think this was wrong to do, because he has fought for civil rights before and his economic platform greatly fights for the poor and working class, in which black people are disproportionately represented. I also think many of the things that were said by these protesters were racist or at least bigoted in their own right, like criticizing Bernie Sanders for being white. Why did these protesters think that this was a good thing to do? Why did they think it helps their cause?
