I live in the middle of Big Ten Country. I've been an SEC fan from birth. I may be slightly biased, and that's why I welcome someone to CMV. Every year, Big Ten fans claim, and go on, and on, about how the Big Ten is going to be a dominating conference this year. Always. Yet, each year, they tend to disappoint. Pundits, fans, alumni, everyone gets all high on the wagon, and then when they get to a championship game, or a BCS bowl, they choke. Every team, almost every time. Where does everyone get the idea that this is a conference of anything other than overrated teams? Please CMV.
