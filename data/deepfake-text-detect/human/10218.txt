I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form. The facts are: McDonalds brewed (and continues to brew) coffee at standard brewing temperatures of 200F McDonalds holds and serves its coffee after brewing between 170-180F (which is no different than most other restaurants) McDonalds has NOT lowered the temperature of their coffee, nor have the changed the temps at which they hold and serve coffee To me, the purchaser of coffee acknowledges the fact that they're buying near-boiling water when they decided "hey, I want coffee." Change my view, please. [sources] EDIT: Looks like I screwed up by questioning the frivolousness of the case. Even if the blame doesn't lie on McDonalds, the case does not seem to be frivolous in the slightest. This was an easy one. Thanks guys.
