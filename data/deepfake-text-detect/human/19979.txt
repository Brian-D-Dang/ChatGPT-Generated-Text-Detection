Before I get started, I know exactly what you're going to say "The Constitution is a living document and can change through time." Well yeah the constitution can be changed in baby steps, but only if congress cooperates, which they never do and never will. The US constitution was made back when the US was a small world power and not very big, but now since the US is a huge world power the constitution gives too much power to a central body. All the power to a central body makes federal government either slow or corrupted. The two party system we have in the US creates a gridlock in governments, Local and National,and prevents a lot of the people's voices, like third parties, from being heard. Republican and Democratic views are very similar, but still are against each other, so no change will ever happen. The Constitution is over 200 years old and was written before multiple revolutions in America (ex. Industrial Revolution, Civil War, World Wars, Cold War, and the electronic revolution), but we still look at it like it's the bible.
