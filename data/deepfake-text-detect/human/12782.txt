"Sprawling on the fringes of the city," rebels goad, "in geometric order," the disillusioned firebrands pity masses in "an insulated border." The demagogue appeals to human rights, hoping to chill supporters to the bone. With honeyed words, "in between the bright lights," he pauses, "and the far unlit unknown." "Growing up, it all seems so one-sided," relates one, "opinions all provided." The crowd adds, "the future pre-decided." The mob chants, "detached and subdivided, nowhere is, in the mass production zone, the dreamer or the misfit so alone." - The rioters blame the "subdivisions." Anarchists say it's "in the high school halls." The socialists, for fiscal revisions, prefer to say it's "in the shopping malls." But each of the'oppressed,' without a doubt, believe that it's "conform or be cast out." - They seek to bring change "in the basement bars," reasoning that it's where their ideals sprout. Cries the demagogue, "in the backs of cars," with bitter quip, "be cool or be cast out." The irony: this "unattractive truth" is naivete - "restless dreams of youth."
