The average wage in China for a factory worker in 2009, the most recent reliable number that I could find, was 1.74. Compared to Western nations, health and safety regulations are almost non-existent. On top of all of this, the government of China is an oppressive, fascist, Communist regime. If Americans are going to casually perform the despicable, unpatriotic, anti-democratic act of supporting the economy of such a Communist state and the international corporations which are allowed to exploit the workers there, they should at least be constantly reminded that this is what they are doing. Obviously, companies selling Chinese-made goods will not volunteer to move to such accurate labeling on their own, so the government should mandate that they do so. Change my view!
