Antibiotics is a general term for chemicals that kills bacteria. Most of the antibiotics we have we found by looking at how fungus or other bacteria to protect themselves. These chemicals are not antibodies or any part of the immune system. Why do they work so well? We've selected the ones that evolved to work well. We've studied which antibiotics work for which bacteria (or at least general types of bacteria) so we know what will work best in different cases. Different antibiotics attack [different parts of the bacteria] (URL0). They don't always. There are more and more antibiotic resistance bacteria since they are evolving to resist the antibiotics we use. There are other ways of fighting bacteria. In some cases we try to make the bacteria more sensitive to weaker antibiotics, in some cases we use vaccines to make the immune system work better (like we'd use for viral diseases), and in some case we use a type of virus called a phage that infects and destroys bacteria.
