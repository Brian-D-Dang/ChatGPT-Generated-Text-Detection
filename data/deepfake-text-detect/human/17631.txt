I think I did this right? Whenever I mention how Harper messed up on a specific event some right-wing person near me (people who I know, generally) says that he's a perfect man who's done only good for Canada, and this outrages me. I can hardly ever say why when asked, so I'd like to hear the other side to help me out, and maybe even CMV.
