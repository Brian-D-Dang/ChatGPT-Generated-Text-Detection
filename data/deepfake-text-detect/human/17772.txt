Young adults today are obviously facing a great number of mental health issues. From my observations, I've noticed that many who should be getting help don't do so because they are worried about the stigma, or because they don't realize that they have an issue (although there are other reasons). I feel that implementing preliminary mental health screenings in high schools would be an effective way to identify those who seem to be at risk and may need help (confidentially of course). They could then be referred to specialists for an actual diagnosis and treatment. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
