Drove 7hrs on Interstate 5 to Los Angeles. The speed limit was 70mph. There were quite a few Semis on the way only going 55mph so we stayed in the left lane to pass them all. Several times drivers would be going at least 90mph and flipping me off because I would not move out of their way so they could pass. I did not see why I should accommodate their unsafe driving and have to constantly switch lanes because they are choosing to exceed the maximum speed limit. They should go around me, and if they cannot do so while I am passing a car in the slow lane they should wait to pass me after I eventually overtake the other vehicle. The reason I posted this in CMV is because so many people were upset over my actions. Is this some unwritten driving rule I do not know about? Edit: I see alot of comments suggesting I just swallow my pride and move over for them to avoid angering them further. I guess I did not make it clear earlier that in most of the highway is packed with Semi trucks and the only two options are be behind a semi going 55, or in the left lane. It was a two lane highway and I did not feel that going faster than 70 mph was safe nor fuel efficient so I did not increase my speed so they could save a few extra seconds time. It was not a matter of controlling their speed at all. I just felt that I should not have to cater to them if they are the ones choosing to go faster. I do understand the point about getting them on their way to avoid any dangerous situations.
