If you look at my comment history, you'll see at least 2 or 3 instances where people called me an asshole for splitting up my replies across multiple comments. I think they considered it karma-whoring (though I have no idea why a person would do something just for the useless karma points). I'm specifically referring to when I have multiple things to say about something, and those things have nothing to do with each other. Example: OP says "My dog is named Yellow Submarine," and I make two replies: (1) "Dog names are weird; isn't it funny how they are so rarely people names like 'Peter'? link to Family Guy clip," and (2) "I never understood why the Beatles made a song about a Yellow Submarine. Anybody know?" I split up my replies because I consider it to be good reddiquette: It allows the good parts to float to the top (via upvotes) and the bad parts to sink (via downvotes) independently. It avoids TLDR posts and entire threads that are only read by their two authors. It takes advantage of Reddit's beautiful branching structure to allow readers to follow precisely the line of reasoning they want to read, without unrelated bullcrap. Please leave the footnote below the following line, but remember to delete this sentence by replacing it with the body of your post. Thank you! Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things. Firstly, please remember to [read through our rules] . If you see a comment that has broken one, it is more effective to report it than downvote it. Speaking of which, [downvotes don't change views] !
