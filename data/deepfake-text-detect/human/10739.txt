You can't inhale straight steam, like from an industrial-scale boiler. It'll flash-scald the insides of your lungs. You can breathe air that contains water fog. The droplets do indeed stick to the inside of your nose, throat, and lungs - but those surfaces are already wet with mucus. [There is very little liquid water in fog.] (URL0) So, it's a matter of scale: you don't drown in fog for the same reason you don't drown in your own mucus. You swallow both. In fact, you swallow a quart of mucus a day. A few teaspoons of water on top of that is nothing.
