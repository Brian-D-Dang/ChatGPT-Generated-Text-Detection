I've been traveling Europe for the past few weeks, one thing that seems to be fairly common (specifically in Rome) is for homeless people to have dogs. I think that it is extremely selfish and irresponsible for homeless people to have dogs. I understand that homeless people need companions but I find it to be unfair that they pin that on an animal which has no choice. They need to figure out how to get a stable job and save up money rather than get a dog and pay for its food and water everyday. If the dog gets sick, how are they going to pay for treatment and take care of the dog in a fair and adequate way?
