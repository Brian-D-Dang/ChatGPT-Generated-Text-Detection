I am beginning to think that sociopathic behavior is closely related to loneliness. Perhaps loneliness is a main cause of such behavior. I think that this because sociopaths, especially ones who are frustrated out of not being recognized, noticed, loved, or observed, begin to develop a need to connect to other humans in some way. Either by being noticed, admired, followed or observed. Due to the lack of professional capability and skill (let's get real you need to be famous to be on TV), but clearly, intelligence, meticulousness and a desire for recognition are strong. CMV.
