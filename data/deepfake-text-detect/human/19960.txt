If someone has an opinion that I think is either obviously wrong or not well supported, I tend to pursue that topic with them to an annoying degree. My goal of pursuing it is to understand why they believe it. If they have good evidence for their opinionbelief, I want to believe it too. My method of pursuing this conversation is not delicate. If the person I'm talking with doesn't have reasoning I understand, I point out that I don't understand it, what part I don't understand and ask them to clarify. This turns into an argument, and I get angry (frustrated, flustered) when people use circular logic or don't feel the need to justify their opinions (and beliefs) with evidence or reasoning. Edit: I think it is a disservice to both of us if we don't talk about it because if they are right then I am wrong, and if I am right than he is wrong. Or if we misunderstood each other, we could both be wrong or both be right but by talking about it, we would be learning (about the topic, about the other person's views, ect.) I want to CMV on this because it drives people away, makes me seem insensitive, and hurts friendships.
