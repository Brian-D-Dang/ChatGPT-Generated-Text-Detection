My girlfriend of 1 year is occasionally in contact with her ex-boyfriend who she dated in high school. While I have no suspicion of foul play, I don't believe that someone can be strictly platonic friends with someone they used to date and have sex with. We are in college and when she returns home, she sees him because they're in the same group of friends. We live in totally opposite areas of the country, so I have never had the chance to meet him. I have an ex-girlfriend whom I'm no longer in contact with because we've simply moved on and that's that. My current girlfriend, in contrast, texts with her ex-boyfriend and has invited him to a family holiday party. I find it very weird to have invited him to a family party. I don't believe you can be good, platonic friends after being in a romantic relationship and find it weird to invite an ex to a family party. CMV! Hello, users of CMV!
