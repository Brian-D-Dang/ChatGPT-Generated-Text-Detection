I don't understand what is the hype about this place. Based on the ratings, I decided to try it myself. I got the chicken and waffle breakfast and my husband got the man vs. food house special. I was surprised by the portion because their hella huge. Its like a meal for two. I am a big fan of chicken and waffle breakfast but I was not impressed with theirs. First the waffle was soggy so I asked for the waffle to be crispy. When it came back to me, it still wasn't crispy but the server said that's their crispy. I asked for it to be almost burned. I waited patience and started eating my chicken. It was actually good. But reminded me of southern style chicken. I don't care much for it. When the waffle came back, it still was not crispy. So I just gave up on it. I think my husband had the andy's sage fried chicken. It a bunch of stuff on a place. I don't even know where to explain. For me it was ALRIGHT. I would eat it but it was just too much to finish. On the other hand, my husband (who is a chef) did not care for it at all. So that was a total fail. Would I do back again? Probably not. We love good food and appreciate where what we spend our money on. This was just not one of them.
