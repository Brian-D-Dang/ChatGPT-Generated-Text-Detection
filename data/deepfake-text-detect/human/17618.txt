Half an year ago when I used to go to AskReddit there used to be a ton of comments which had gold. Today I can barely see such a thing and seeing someone receive gold is almost rare. Doesn't this mean that the reddit ownerCEO??? will be forced to sell out, given the financial condition of the site? Or am I wrong and somehow I always miss the comments and posts which get gold? Which reminds me that posts getting gold is something I can't even recall seeing. Is this even a thing? Less and less people are buying and receiving gold. CMV.
