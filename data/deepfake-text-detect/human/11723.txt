Tesla plans to open its Supercharger network to non-Tesla electric vehicles in the US in late 2022. Elon Musk has been talking about opening up the network to other companies' EVs for years. Tesla has been allowing non-Tesla EVs to use its Supercharger plugs in several cities in Europe as part of a limited pilot program. Non-Tesla vehicles will need an adapter to access Tesla Superchargers in North America.
