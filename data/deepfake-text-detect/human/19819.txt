From an ESPN article titled, "Exemptions Benefit Athletes," it is stated that, "77 of the 92 Football Bowl Subdivision schools that provided information to the AP reported using special admissions waivers to land athletes and other students with particular talents." Special admissions waivers are approved by the NCAA in order to allow athletes who would not typically meet the admissions requirements to be accepted to a college (different colleges have different special admissions requirements). I believe that this is wrong, as college is defined first and foremost as "a building for an educational purpose" (Webster). The purpose of attending college is to receive an education. To admit students under different admissions requirements (because without them those athletes wouldn't be able to attend said college) is wrong, as it demonstrates that the college is not seeking to have these students represent them as an academic institution as they should be, rather as an athletic enterprise. All students whether they are athletes or not should be held to the same admissions criteria as this will make the admissions process more competitive, and athletes who are able to get into schools without special admissions waivers will prove their dedication to education, versus athletics, as it should be.
