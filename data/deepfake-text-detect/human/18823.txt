everyone lives in their box, and only few people are willing to open it and 'become lucid'. everything we create is a construction. life is a void, too many variables, and only some connections between them can last. inevitably those connections will die. i think everyone should experience the world of pure contingency so that people are not bound to their ideologies (religiosity, dogmatism, state-ismpolitic etc.) so whole heatedly. i guess there is two arguments here: the first being a 'given' (or not)..that lsd can help promote this type of deep questioning of everything you ever knew. and two, which can be separated into a strong and a weak one: the strong one being that 'everyone' who can try it should try it. the weak one being that 'most people' good luck, lets remain civil: also i dont really want to hear stuff promoting the drug war or debate that at all. its probably the case that if you believe in this, then we have nothing really to talk about lol.. you could still give it a try?
