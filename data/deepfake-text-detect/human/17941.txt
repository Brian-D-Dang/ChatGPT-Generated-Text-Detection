Whenever I see a family with a lot of kids they can never control them and the kids are always disruptive of whatever is around them. For example, museums, restaurants, airplanes. So why, I ask, am I meant to be okay with you having so many kids that you can't control them and it starts significantly interfering with my life? I'm not going to empathize or have the favor returned to me because I'm never going to have that many kids. I think its selfish to have so many kids at once that you have to rely on the kindness and patience of strangers on a consistent basis. CMV
