Over a substantial period of time in the past couple of years, I've experienced a lot of self harmers and the like. This particular view comes from one girl in particular, who I was involved with for a time but things came to their natural end. The thing was, the entire time I was involved with her, before and after, she was suffering with severe depression. As a part of her depression she became reliant on self harm to try and relieve some of the every day stress that she was subjected to (people with anxiety will really be able to identify with the stress I refer to here. I would spend hours each day talking her through the negative thoughts she felt and the reasons she had for cutting (this view refers to all self harm, her particular method was using a blade, but cigarette burns, medications, all methods are involved in the view I'd very much like to change) and almost every day she would ask "why are you so opposed to it" That really made me question it myself, and I really couldn't tell you why I'm so opposed to it. I don't like it, but I don't see any logical reason that I should tell or ask people to stop.
