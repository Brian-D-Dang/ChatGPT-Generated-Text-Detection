I have heard a lot about fluid sexuality where a person can fall for any other type of person at any time in their life. For instance a person can like men one day and the next day be sexually attracted women, it is all a free form that bounces from one desire to the next. However this has not been my experience and after asking many of my peers they agree that their sexuallity has never changed naturally. I am a male who is attracted to other males. Never in my life have I ever felt myself being sexually attracted to women and never have I not been attracted to men. The only time that my feelings have shifted are when I was trying to make myself like women, but in that case it was not natural and was forced. I have discussed this with many of my friends and we agree that if you like one you basically like them forever. In the case of bisexuals, this is the same concept, they like men and women or any other gender identification and they like both for the rest of their lives. Even if they like one gender more one year and then switch, they are sticking to their spectrum of desire. Sexuallity is not a fluid thing that shifts from one sexuality to the next, it is a set of rules governing who we are attracted to. Anytime that our sexual preference does switch is caused by ourselves forcing the new desire to either suppress or enhance some sexual desire.
