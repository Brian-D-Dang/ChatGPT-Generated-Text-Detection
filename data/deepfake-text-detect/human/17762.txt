I've lived in Asia for 5 years now. Of all the things that I miss about the US, I don't miss tipping. In fact this is one of the things I love the most about Asia. I get great staff, I've never had waiting staff be rude to me or give me poor service. Whenever I come to the US, I cringe at the thought about having to tip. You don't tip your doctor do you? Do you tip your dentist? It's not my fault that your employer doesn't pay a living wage. I am paying for a service, to dine at X establishment. That doesn't mean that I decided to also contribute more than the menu price to paying your salary. Anyone that says they aren't motivated to be in service unless they weren't in it for tips, well I'm sorry I don't know what to tell you. I think it's complete horse shit that this has allowed to permeate throughout the whole US. You are no expected to tip everything from getting hair cut, to mailman to it seems like just about everyone in the world. If I'm taking a taxi, I paid you for your services, therefore why do you expect me to pay you more. If you want to make more, than you should raise your prices. I believe this is the same for restaurants. I honestly don't believe that restaurants could not survive if they raised prices. In fact for some people, it's more anxiety thinking about the whole tip thing. I for one would much rather pay a little bit more, or have a built in "service charge," that have to deal with some uppity servers attitude with tipping.
