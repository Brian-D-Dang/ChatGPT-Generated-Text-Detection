I tried posting this earlier, but I forgot about rule E. Here we go. In this day and age the only uses for desktop computers are video editing, 3D modeling and gaming. In other words, things that require large amounts of power. And obviously anything can complete these tasks via sheer attrition. Eventually processors will reach a point of diminishing returns. Mobile CPUs and GPUs will catch up with their desktop counterparts. People often cite cooling as desktop's major advantage, but most properly ventilated and well dusted laptops have no problem. Even now there are very few mainstream games an average desktop can run that a gaming laptop can't. My current laptop (Lenovo Y500) can run any game I've thrown at it. Laptops are generally more practical that desktop PCs. One can bring a laptop to class, an internet cafe, the living room, even public transportation.
