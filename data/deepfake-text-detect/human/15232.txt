Just to entertain myself I stopped in this Ross to compare it to my favorite Ross location (SunnyslopeDunlap store) Just as I expected it was total bootleg up in this location. Man the place was jacked! It's larger and you find a few more or different items as a result. The prices are the same as the other location on items that both have stocked. But this place looked like it had been hit by a plane. Broken stuff, stuff on the floor, stuff falling off hangers, stuff in the wrong departments and wrong shelves. Tables in complete disarray! Bedding and pillows on the floor. Lines...OMG! What long lines! The couple of items that interest me that I spotted I passed on rather than wait in these long lines. No staff on the floor offering help. One poor staff person was putting out artwork and avoiding all contact with customers. Can't say I blame her because the customers were shouting for and at their unruly children and crying babies at decibels uncalled for. I think this clerk just wanted to disappear. So when I saw items of interest without a price I just respected her by not asking for help and leaving the items where I found them. The odd thing is 3 hours before I had just shopped my favorite location where all was calm, organized and with short quick moving lines! So glad there are other locations of Ross stores near by offering the same great deals.
