Facebook Gaming is introducing a new feature that lets viewers hop into game streams with their favorite gaming personalities. Viewers can now click a button to open games and join streamers in multiplayer mode for a small selection of games. Streamers can control who can use the feature, allowing them to limit its use to their most dedicated supporters. Facebook Gaming will give 100 percent of revenue to creators until 2022. The platform is still small, but its emphasis on mobile-friendly games could attract viewers who are unlikely to find themselves on Twitch.
