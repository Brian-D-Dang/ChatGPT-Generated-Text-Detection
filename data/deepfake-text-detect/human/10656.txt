Wombats poop on top of rocks and logs near their burrows. The reason for this is not to keep intruders away, but to use as an indicator to know where their home is. Wombats have terrible eyesight however they have an extraordinary sense of smell. The reason for these rubiks poop is because if the Wombat's are to effectively effectively smell their way home, their turds must remain where they dropped it, hence the fact that their excretion is cube, not circular. Who want's their shit rolling away?
