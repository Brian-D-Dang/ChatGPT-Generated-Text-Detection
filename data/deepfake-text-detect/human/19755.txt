We all know the song by now: the original Star Wars trilogy is the tops, while the prequel trilogy was an affront to everything that's amazing about the originals. I wish I could unsee Episodes I and II, but I don't think we're giving Episode III enough credit. What are a couple of major complaints we hear about Episode III? Hayden Christensen and poor delivery of bad dialogue. I agree that Hayden Christensen gave a whiny performance when he should have been a badass, but that's exactly what Mark Hamill did in Episode IV. Luke is, at points, unbearably whiny, and his delivery is rarely on par with the likes of James Earl Jones or Harrison Ford. Also, let's not forget that Carrie Fisher initially spoke with a somewhat British accent that deteriorated over the course of Episode IV and flat out disappeared in Episodes V and VI. Neither Fisher nor Hamill can be considered good examples of quality acting in Episode IV. Despite flaws with the script in some areas, Episode III has two major things going for it: Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid. Ewan McGregor made one hell of an Obi Wan, especially in Episode III, and Ian McDiarmid's Emperor Palpatine really had some opportunities to shine in the movie. Plus, despite what you may think about the stylized lightsaber fights in the prequel trilogy, that final battle between Obi Wan and Anakin was pretty awesome - awesome enough, in fact, that not even Christensen's poor acting could bring it down. So there you have it. I think if we're going to consider Episode IV a good Star Wars movie, we can certainly rank Episode III among the good ones as well. Change my view. EDIT: Guys! I'm a nerd discussing Star Wars on the Internet - of course I've seen Red Letter Media's critique. I want to know specifically why you disagree with me. Let's have a discussion about this!
