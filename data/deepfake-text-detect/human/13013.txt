Item: SCP-5939 Object Class: Safe Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5939 is to be kept in Site-39 Refrigerated Containment when not in testing. All images of SCP-5939 are to be modified by a Memetics Division specialist before publication. Description: SCP-5939 is a sandwich, composed of white bread, peanut butter, and grape jelly. SCP-5939's cognitohazardous properties manifest through direct or indirect observation of the object, or through images of the object with greater than 74 of the object visible (Images with significant amounts of artifacting or corruption may not display the effects, but this is not guaranteed). When SCP-5939 is viewed for greater than 16 seconds, subjects will begin to perceive other objects in their field of view as being additional instances of SCP-5939. The number of perceived SCP-5939 instances increases exponentially, with the subject's vision becoming entirely SCP-5939 instances within four minutes. This effect does not cease when the subject is no longer viewing the original object or image, though Class-C amnestics have proven effective in reversing the effect. Addendum A: Test log 5939-40-M-P In this test, a D-class was anesthetized and placed in a room with a minimum of objects. SCP-5939 was placed on a table within the room. Researcher: Good afternoon, D-2754. Please, kindly evaluate the sandwich. D-2754: Ugh..... Hey, I thought you said that the test was tomorrow! What's going on?! Researcher: You must be mistaken. Anyway, please try to stay on task here. Take a look at the sandwich over there. D-2754: Alri- You guys do know I'm allergic to peanuts, right? Wait, since when was this huge one in here? Researcher: There are two of them, you say? D-2754: Wait, wasn't I sitting on a cha- oh God, the air- Subject collapsed at this point. Examination of the subject's body revealed severe swelling of the throat, consistent with an allergic reaction. These symptoms ceased when amnestics were applied.
