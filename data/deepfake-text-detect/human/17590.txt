I believe that the United states was wrong in dropping the atomic bombs on Japan at the conclusion of World War II. I think this way because of the mass civilian casualties, over 100,000. These civilians were not part of the fight for a reason, they didn't want to be. So why was it acceptable for the US military to bomb two cities that have been proven to show no militaristic advantages. I believe that there would be much better ways to end this war than to brutally kill civilians, and give others a death sentence (radiation). CMV.
