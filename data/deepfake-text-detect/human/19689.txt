The map as it is favors the GOP heavily. The D's have 21 seats running for re-election and the R's have 15. 7 of the Democrats are running in states that Romney won (North Carolina, Lousiana, Alaska, Arkansas, Montana, West Virginia, and South Dakota) and only 1 Republican is running in a state Obama won (Susan Collins in Maine and she is a virtual lock for re-election). The only GOP seat that is even feasible for Democrats to take is Mitch McConnel's seat, and that is pretty unlikely. Out of the 7 seats the Dem's hold in GOP states, they are currently predicted to lose 4 of them (Montana, West Virginia, South Dakota, Arkansas). So that leaves 3 states in Alaska, Lousiana, and North Carolina as toss ups. If the Republicans win 2 of these contests they will have the majority in the Senate. Given election history of the President's party doing very poorly in midterm elections, and even worse in the second midterms of two term presidents, it looks pretty dim for these democrats. The seats in NC and Alaska were won in 2008 in a Presidential election year that heavily favored democrats. Barring idiotic nominees from the GOP (which is possible), they have a very good chance of taking away the Senate in November. CMV
