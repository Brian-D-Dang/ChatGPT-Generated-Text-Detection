Doris has been recovered, said Wrexham police inspector Paul Wycherley, who tweeted that two suspects had been arrested following a chase on foot. Doris, Blessing and Wheely Good Sheep were painted by schoolchildren and placed on St Giles Way this month. Website Wrexham.com said they were installed to mark the Tour of Britain cycle race being held in the area soon.
