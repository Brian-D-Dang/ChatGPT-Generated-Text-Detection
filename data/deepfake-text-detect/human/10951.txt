This is a really good explanation of how a transistor works.] (URL0) ','Transistor as Oscillator (actually, you need other components to "tune" it right, but the transistor is the heart of the circuit). This one is a Hartley oscillator (in ELI5 terms): 1) Let's say you're a human transistor. You have a speaker near your left ear that gives you a soft noise (a bunch of soft beeps). 2) When you hear enough noise, it triggers you to say "beep!" into a microphone. 3) Part of that microphone circuit goes back to the speaker in your left ear, and causes you to hear your own "beep!." It's loud enough to cause you to say "beep!" again into the microphone, and the process repeats. 4) With the right filtering and the right "length" of the circuit, you can tune this self-feedback loop to make you say "beep!" exactly 3 times per second (3Hz), or 5 times per second (5Hz), or whatever frequency you want (within limits, of course). 5) Congratulations! You've become a human transistor oscillator! And now your parents will hate you and duct-tape your mouth closed and make you live in a closet.
