"Sound the bell! Sound the bell!" The wolves have already taken a few. Armed with a pitchfork, Moscavon hurries to the dying villagers. He trusts the pitchfork onto the wolf and severs the eye, which was enough to stop him. He watches as the wolves dine on the dead husks tearing limb from limb. "Astrov! Vladimir! Hold them off while the rest of the people get inside!" "Mother?..." Astrov's mother was killed with a skull-crushing bite. The villagers rush into the town hall, pushing and trampling the elders. It seemed like hours as Moscovon watched the wolves eat. Vlad didn't make it due to seizures once the wolf had bitten into his neck. Only a thousand were still alive. They must wait a day for the government to send help as they weep for their losses, forever scarred by this moment.
