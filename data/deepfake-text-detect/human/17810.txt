It is a commonly held belief in the job market that it is bad to have a job on your resume that you have held for 10-20 years. The common reasons for this are that it shows you lack initiative and that your skills are now outdated. I view this as a ridiculous assumption. I believe there is a lot of value in holding that same job for a long time. First off, it shows that you are good at what you do and have made yourself valuable to your employer. Second, unless your company has decided to stay in the stone age, you are growing and keeping up with technology in your position as your company progresses to adopt recent technology. If I see a resume where someone has four or five jobs that they've worked three or four years or less at each job, that would be a red flag to me. It would show someone who is uncommitted and may be an undesirable employee who lacks in some key quality, such as teamwork or work ethic. I understand that to some degree, there are positives and negatives for both cases; what I don't understand is why the job market completely frowns upon one stance and embraces the other.
