Revenge is basically you harming people who harmed you. There's nothing wrong harming people who harmed you, because hey, why bother forgiving people who harmed you? Harming people who harmed you is justice, and I don't see justice as a bad thing. In fact, isn't justice people strive for? Why let the people who harmed you harm you again and again when you could just harm (or even kill) them? That way, you show them how you felt being harmed by them. That's why I support executions and the death penalty. They get rid of the killers and criminals out from the earth and it's also greener, as resources would go to the people who need them and not to the killers and criminals. Same thing with starving the said killers and criminals to death. Heck, if the killers and criminals are very dangerous, just torture them, then kill them. That's why I also support torture to the criminals and killers. Because they would learn a lesson by torture. Revenge would teach the people who harmed you a lesson by you harming them.
