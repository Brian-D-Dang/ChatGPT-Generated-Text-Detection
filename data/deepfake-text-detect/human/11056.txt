Usually odd numbers are on one side of the road, evens on the other side. Usually they skip some numbers to leave room, in case someone sticks a new building in between at some future date.', "It may be a small county, like here where when you buy a piece of land, if it doesn't have an address, you simply tell the county clerk what number it is and, that number sticks. Mine is 299, net door one way is 301 and 285 the other side of me. (there is room between the houses and, I own 3 sections on the county map so 299, 297 and 295 are mine but, only 299 is actually listed as an address because I picked that number. 304 is across the street directly. Ask the county clerk for that county, they probably know.,If you really want to know contact the city planning office and get a copy of the town plancadastral map. The reason for the skipped addresses is probably that multiple plats were combined into one property. Towns are often divided up in the town plan into lots of "plats" that are small bits of land and each may have its own address. If someone buys, for example, plats 270, 272, and 274 and builds a house their address would be 270, but the next house would be 276.', "In older parts of my town, addresses seem to skip because there are actually houses behind the houses you see. So you see 200 and 206, but if you walk up the path between those, you'll find 2 duplexes with 201, 202, 203, and 204. Maybe your area has some of that too
