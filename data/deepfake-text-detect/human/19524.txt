Many people have seemed to disagree but never realy given me ANY arguments. I mean, what is the point of killing in the name of your god? For example. Person A is jewish. Person B is christian. Without even properly meeting, they viciously hate eachother. Or a christian, not allowing an atheist into their home just because he is an atheist. Please, change my view.
