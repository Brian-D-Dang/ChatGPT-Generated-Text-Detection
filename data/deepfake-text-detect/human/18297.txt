Despite my previous stances years ago on gun control (my family has been in the gun business for over half a century, and I myself started selling guns at my dad's shop in 6th grade), I now am of the "extreme" opinion that in order to buy a gun, one must take a written and field exam. We require it of drivers because vehicles are dangerous, can kill people if misused, require skills to operate, and demand to be taken seriously as the driver will be held accountable for their failure to comply to standards of safety. We treat guns like toys. We have no requirement of knowledge of use, safety, storage, etc. We do not require the same level of respect of firearms that we emphasize, reiterate, and maintain of driving a vehicle. That is absolutely outrageous to me and against all logic.
