I was talking to my friends about this the other day and I couldn't find an opposing argument that made sense to me. I personally feel that the success of a band today is purely based off of the vocals. Based off of this the vocalist is clearly the most important member of a band. Most popular songs today feature very strong malefemale vocalists. You very rarely hear music without any vocals at all, and when you do this music isn't commercially successful. Look at "Uptown Funk" for example. The artist had the sound he liked, but until Bruno Mars was added to it, the song didn't take off. I also feel that while you can have a fantastic guitarist, drummer, keyboardist, etc... without great vocals backing it up the band is doomed to failure. Obviously Eric Clapton, Jimmy Hendrix, Jimmy Page, etc... were beyond amazing and their guitar playing was on unreal. I still feel that even in these situations they're at their best when they have great vocals along with it. So convince me that another instrument is just as important, or more important then the lead singer. Edit: I wrote below that I agree that Pink Floyd and others, are great example of a band that couldn'tdidn't rely on vocals. I would like to be convinced, however, that this still holds true in modern music. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
