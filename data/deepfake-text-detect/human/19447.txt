While purusueing the other otherkin cmvs, I couldn't shake my personal difficulties with accepting otherkin culturally. While I can accept belief and psychology factors, I struggle to see how an individual who claims to be born non-human, can employ human functions, such as language, manners, art, and all things thumb related in human culture. I have tried to make mental parallels between otherkin and transgenders in terms of language barriers, but while one asks only for a new word or a redefinition, the other creates a conflict of though as one mostly says "I cannot speak human." Perhaps I just am hurt by the lack of recognition. Human beings are beautiful creatures culturally, I can't understand a thought process that wants to get rid of language, art and self consciousness. Please change my views on this. (Extra. Caption asked to confirm if I was human. I feel conflicted about my opinions)
