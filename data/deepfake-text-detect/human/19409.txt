Many sportspersons are accused of doing many bad things like sleeping around, or drinking, or partying, etc. If a person plays a sport, he is expected to perform well in the sport, and nothing more. For example, Tiger Woods, John Terry, etc were in the media limelight for having multiple mistresses, but this isn't really related to their sport. If Woods continues to play great golf and Terry soccer, why should they be penalised? Why do we feel that they're having a bad effect on youngsters? Youngsters follow these sportspersons for skills and that is all. I don't think my son will care if Tiger Woods had sex with ten different women. All he will care about is the dedication with which Woods plays golf and executes his techniques. Change my view, please!
