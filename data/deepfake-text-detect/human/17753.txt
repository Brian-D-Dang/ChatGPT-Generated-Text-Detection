The topic is what it says on the tin. It seems to me that allowing "vengeance" to be considered when sentencing criminals or drafting new legislation is rather silly. It only serves to make the victim or their family feel better (even though it rarely results in that) and doesn't actually accomplish anything that can be measured. If I execute a criminal because of some moral outrage, I've removed his potential input to society. If I rehabilitate him, I've saved it. It seems odd to me to get rid of potentially useful individuals in order to have a slim chance at making some people feel a bit better. I'll be AFK for a few hours but I'll be sure to respond to any replies when I return. Thank you.
