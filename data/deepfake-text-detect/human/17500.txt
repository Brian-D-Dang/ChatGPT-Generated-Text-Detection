Having just read The End of Faith, I am quite startled that I can see reason in Harris' arguments against the cultural and religious traits of the Muslim world (for example, that Muslims cannot 'handle' democracy, that politics and religion have little bearing on the radicalism present in the Muslim world, that Islam is inherently violent and incompatible with Western liberal ideals and caustic to the preservation of civilization, and general condemnation of Islam) and am quite disturbed, as I feel they border on 'Islamophobia'. I have viewed myself a quite tolerant of other faiths (I'm an atheist myself) and have previously had sympathy for Muslims facing discrimination in the US and abroad, but these arguments seem to undercut this. I do not know where to see his arguments explored more deeply, or know where to read good criticism, but as I have read them, his arguments seem convincing. CMV.
