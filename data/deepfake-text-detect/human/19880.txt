Simply put, Tim doesn't have the arm. His QB rating, an objective measure of performance, is atrocious. I don't believe 4th quarter comebacks justify Tebow's believers, not in the games he played where he lead a clearly superior Denver team into a 4th-quarter deficit. He did have a playoff win. I'm convinced I personally would have been able to beat a banged-up steelers team with the surrounding cast Tebow had. I think Kyle Orton was the better QB the whole time, and he now backs up Tony "I can't even throw a temper tantrum without it turning into a pick-6" Romo. Mark Sanchez was the obvious choice in New York. Tebow clearly couldn't beat out the Buttfumbler for a starting job, and couldn't beat out Greg McElroy for the backup job. His tryout with New England was a good move by the front office to draw attention away from the depleted receiving corps, Aaron Hernandez murder trial, and the possibility the Pats might not win the division for the second time in 10 years. After working out with numerous QB gurus, under several head coaches, being mentored by good QBs, and playing football at a competitive level for over a decade, Tebow knows his strengths and weaknesses. Throwing a football isn't something he can consistently do well at the NFL level, even in an emergency backupspecial teams situation. My assessment of his skill has absolutely nothing to do with his faith and evangelism, which I find to be off-putting and unprofessional. This has nothing to do with his being named "Most Influential Athlete" by Forbes. This only slightly has to do with the media circus that surrounds him, and the die-hard Tebow fans that seem to value his beliefs over his W's and L's.
