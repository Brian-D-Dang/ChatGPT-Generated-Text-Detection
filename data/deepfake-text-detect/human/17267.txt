I don't deny that there is a range of sexual desire and that there are some people who really don't like sex, but I also think that there are a lot of reasons someone could not want sex, like depression or general discomfort with sex, that are much more common than true asexuality. Many people compare asexuality to homosexuality in that it is inherent and people should stop trying to "fix" them, but low sexual desire is a shown side effect of depression, certain drugs, etc, so it isn't really the same. I also get irritated by people who try to compare the hardships they face being asexual to those faced by gays, transgendered people or racial minorities. Partly because the discrimination they face, like being pressured to get marriedhave kids, are pressures that everyone faces in varying degrees. But also because, even if these pressures are slightly tougher for asexuals, they pale in comparison to the hardships being faced by other minorities.
