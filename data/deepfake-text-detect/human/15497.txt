Perhaps my expectations were too high because of all the hype I'd heard, but I have to say I was a little disappointed. We did a girls' night out and were so excited about this new great winechocolate combo thing, but after waiting forever for a table we waited forever for a waitress, who utimately messed up our order and brought us first the wrong food and then cold food. When they finally got the food right, it was actually pretty goos, but by that time were were kind of over it. As for dessert, we ended up going with these chocolate martinis that were pretty rockin. My suggestion is head there for drinks but not for food.
