Cibo express has confirmed its first check-out free store at Newark Liberty airport. The store will use Amazon's Just Walk Out cashier-less technology. Just Walk Out uses the technology used in Amazon Go supermarkets to allow customers to pick up items and just walk out, with payments debited directly to their credit cards. It meshes computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning technologies to accomplish this feat. Cashier-less stores are more efficient than traditional stores, making them attractive for airport environments where travelers are pressed for time.
