Blackened catfish grits, shrimp grits, crawpuppies - everything here is amazing, and Abita to boot! I've eaten my way through NOLA's best, oldest and most well-known eateries and Lola's has it down. She refuses to buy shrimp from anywhere but the gulf, and orders bread from the big easy too, and the attention to detail shows. My growing gut hates Lola's, but my tastebuds love it!
