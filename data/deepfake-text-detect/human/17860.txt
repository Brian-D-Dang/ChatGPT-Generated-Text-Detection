My main gripe with the a base-10 system is that 10 is only divisible by two numbers (other than 1 and itself), 2 and 5. This makes the calculations of thirds and quarters more cumbersome du to the need to use fractionsdecimals. This is especially bad in the case of 13 since it can only be represented by a recurring decimal (0.33333333...). Additionally, it can only be halved once before you have to stop using whole numbers (102 5, 52 2.5 etc.). Compare this to a base-12 system, 12 is divisible by four numbers other than 1 and itself: 2, 3, 4, and 6. This would make the calculation of thirds a lot simpler since 123 4, a whole number. 12 can also be halved twice, to make whole number halves (6) and quarters (3). Aside from pure ease of calculation and number handling, I believe it would make the process of learning mathematics a lot easier since the concepts of division would be more intuitive. Additionally it would ease the discrepancy between our timing system, which has 24 hours in a day and 60 minutes in an hour, 12 is a factor of both. 10 doesn't fit AT ALL with our timing system and leads to common errors in learning, such as assuming 140 minutes is one hour and 40 minutes etc. You might be thinking "HEY but we have 10 fingers on our hands and this is one the most useful tools that kids use to learn how to count!" True. But this can be remedied by using our knuckle-divisions on our the four fingers of each hand creating 12 easily identifiable counting helpers! So yeah there's my argument. CMV. EDIT: spelling
