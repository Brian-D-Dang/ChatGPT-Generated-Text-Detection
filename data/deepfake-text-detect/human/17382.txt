Often times my friends will point out a stranger and describes him as black to identify him, but when they point out a white person, they usually do not describe his race. I think this is inappropriate to do so because it unfairly labels and stereotypes this person. There is so many negative connotations with describing a person by their race whether, black or white or Asian or any other race. CMV
