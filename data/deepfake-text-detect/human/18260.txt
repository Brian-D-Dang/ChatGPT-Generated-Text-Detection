Two days ago I was helping my grandmother go through some of her old stuff that she was trying to give away. In the back for one of her closets was a silver encrusted sword with Christopher Columbus' head as the pummel. It turns out tat my great grandfather was a four degree member of the Knight of Columbus and that high ranking members are given these ceremonial swords. As far as i can tell, the KoC seems to be a pretty decent organization. [A brief look at their wiki page shows they involved in a diverse list of causes and they should be commended for the works that they do.] They have done work with Habitat for Humanity, disaster relief and work with the disabled. The thing that bothers me about them is their inclusion of Christopher Columbus. When I think philanthropy Christopher Columbus really doesn't come to mind. He is know for spreading pandemics and a violent governorship of Hispaniola. All in all, Columbus was a dick. I know that I'm beating a dead horse (especially on Reddit) by saying that we shouldn't be celebrate the life of Christopher Columbus, but i really feel like the Knights of Columbus deserve better then to associate themselves with him. I'm completely open to changing my view so please do so. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
