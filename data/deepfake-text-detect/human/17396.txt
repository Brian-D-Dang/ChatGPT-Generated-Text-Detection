The government does have the right idea that teenagers shouldn't be drinking alcohol, but in my view, nobody who has passed his or her teenage years should be denied. Obviously it should not be 18, because that would give easy access to high school kids. The current drinking age of 21 completely undermines the 20th birthday, the dawn of a new decade, arguably the most important of one's life. Instead of celebrating, most people just simply gloss over their 20th birthdays, just waiting the extra year. Should we skip our 30th birthdays and wait until 31 for a big celebration? 41 instead of 40? Obviously not.
