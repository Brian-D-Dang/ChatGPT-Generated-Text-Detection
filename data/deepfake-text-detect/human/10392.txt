Before I continue, I would like to start by saying that I am not a pedophile and that I am strongly against the sexual abuse of children. My view is based on scientific evidence which strongly suggests that allowing pedophiles to view child porn will result in fewer instances of sexual abuse. Now I understand and accept that some people will say that children who feature in child porn are re-victimised when they learn that people are viewing images of their abuse, but by legalising viewing, this would mean that the victims will never learn that images of their abuse are being viewed and so they will not suffer re-victimisation. There is no evidence to suggest that pedophiles who view child porn are more likely than not to go onto abuse children. In fact, the research suggests the exact opposite. It suggests that pedophiles who have access to child porn are more likely than not to stick with child porn to relieve their desires rather than abuse a child. My view is based on a study titled Legalizing child pornography is linked to lower rates of child sex abuse . Child abuse is abhorrant, but I think to ignore this research is irresponsible. I will not be convinced by anecdotal evidence on this by the way. Please make sure you provide reliable sources for your opinions, like I have. CMV. Edit: Someone has suggested that I make it clear that I am only talking about the viewing of child porn to be legal and not the production or distribution of images. Hello, users of CMV!
