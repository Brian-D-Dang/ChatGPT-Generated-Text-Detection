I went deep sea fishing last weekend on the invitation of a friend, and we caught, faught, and then released some ten to fifteen fish. In order to catch those fish we first caught a lot of bait fish live fish which we caught the night before, then later jammed a giant hook through their still live bodies and tossed them in to the water. I cant find any reason to justify this behavior as a moral human being. The bait fish suffered badly when caught, suffered more when we jammed a hook through their face, and suffered even more as they were stalked by larger fish and the suffering then ended when they were eaten. At which point the other fish suffered with a hook through ITS face, faught for their lives as I dragged them to the surface, then removed the hook and started over. I did not like it. Except... I DID. Fishers... Change my view?
