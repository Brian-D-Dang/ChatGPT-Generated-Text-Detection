Most devoted Christians that I have come across see God as a loving and humble figure, yet Church tradintions (and the bible) and largely about worshipping him. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I recall there being a phrase in Exodus with God saying something like "go to the promised land so you may worship me." I believe that if he cared so much about people and the Earth that he would have better things to do than sit around watching Christians chanting worship. It just doesn't seem like a humble or 'godly' thing to do, to ask people to praise him and worship him. Fell free to try and change my view. Sorry if I have come across as racist to devoted Christians, that's really not what I was going for.
