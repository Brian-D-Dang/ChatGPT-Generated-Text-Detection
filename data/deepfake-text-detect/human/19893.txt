Perhaps a better statement would be, "I don't think having 50 sexual partners over several years and then trying to have a monogamous relationship is very smart." I have three reasons: 1.) There isn't a whole lot of research on the topic, but making the transition from sexual promiscuity to monogamy seems like something a lot of people struggle with. Having sex with dozens of partners seems to trivialize not just sex, but every aspect of flirtatious interactions between males and females. 2.) We get used to that emotional "high" of new sex. Chemically and biologically, it's like a drug. Then all of a sudden we deprive our selves of that drug for and extended time. Looking at statistics, 20 of marriages end in divorce within 5 years. That's a huge number of couples that pull a 180 in a very short time. There are obviously many factors, but I've always wondered if this was one. 3.) I think it also fails to let us "practice" long term monogamy. The only way to know what you want from a long term relationship is to try it out. Jumping into a marriage or a long term commitment without previously trying something similar just seems dumb. To make things worse, society puts enormous pressure on youth to not have long relationships. Especially as a guy, you get ribbed in high school, college, and beyond for making these kinds of commitments. I hope this isn't too broad, and I hope I didn't offend anyone. CMV . EDIT: I guess I just hate how society tells us that you can do whatever you want in your teens and 20s, sleep around if you want, and then when you find the right person it will "just work" and you won't have any temptations or problems. This is beyond misleading.
