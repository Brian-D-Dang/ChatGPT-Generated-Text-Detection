Okay, I'll preface this with the fact that, yes, I am a teenager. If you are going to disregard my view because I am young, I will disregard your comment. Everyone says life gets worse after high school, or that high school was the time of their lives. If that is true, I don't see why suicide isn't an epidemic. Life blows. High school sucks. I spend hours in classes I don't like, working my ass off to be valedictorian so I might, might, make it into a decent college. So, lets say this hard work "pays off," and I get into a good school, then what? I work my ass off for a minimum of another four years so I can be in debt, so I then can work for the rest of my life? And if I don't find time inbetween there to find an emotional partner before my mid-twenties, I may as well give up on ever loving anyone. Some people say, "you need to make your own enjoyment." Yes, because being alone is so very enjoyable. And when do people find the free time to do this? Just as a damn high school student I have like an hour of free time every night. If I have that little free time as a high school student, what am I going to have in college? Where does the enjoyment come in? Why am I working my ass off in high school if life just gets worse regardless? Some people say I should just stop working so hard if it makes me unhappy, but that solves nothing, still. If I stop doing my work now, it will just make the past three years of work essentially worthless, and it isn't like not doing my work will make me happy. I still won't have many good friends. I still won't have more things to do. I would probably just waste time on Reddit and slashdot, because no one wants to hang out with me anyway. What makes everyone so damn happy? I've heard every platitude in the book, but everyone just has some intangible way of forging happiness, or happiness is always coming tomorrow, or happiness was yesterday, or happiness will come; Fuck, I want happiness now.
