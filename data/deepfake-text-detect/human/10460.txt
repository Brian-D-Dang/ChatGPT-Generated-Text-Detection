Whenever you fund such a thing, you are always taking a risk the product won't work out. It could be it isn't practical, it doesn't work as intended, it was some major flaw, or it is just too expensive to produce. Or it might actually be impossible. In all those cases, the developer says, "oh well, we tried" and keeps the money. If they didn't really try, it's fraud and they could face legal consequences. On a side note, Indiegogo has come under a lot of criticism for not properly policing their campaigns. In addition to impossible things like this, there are a lot of pseduoscientific scams they blindly support.', "If they made a genuine effort to build the product but failed, then the backers are shit out of luck. The backers supported a start up, and start ups often fail. The backers could sue to try to get their money back, but if the company spent the money then there's nothing left to pay refunds with. If it can be shown that they know it can't possibly work then they'd be committing fraud and could be prosecuted, but that still won't really help the backers.
