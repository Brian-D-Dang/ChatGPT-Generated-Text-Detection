Future Meat Technologies announced its industrial cultured meat production facility on June 23. The factory, based in Israel, is capable of producing up to 1,100lbs of lab-grown meat every day. It can produce lamb, chicken, and pork products without using genetic modification or animal serum. It is also working on making beef. The facility requires 96 percent less freshwater, 99 percent less land, and produces 80 percent fewer greenhouse emissions than livestock production. Future Meat plans to start selling its products starting next year.
