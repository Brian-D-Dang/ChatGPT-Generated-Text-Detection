I'm a reporter, it's all I can be. Don't ask me how I got here, I know as little as you. I first noticed I was stuck in a video game when it started glitching. James Harden's beard would randomly start to expand, Lebron's hair line would disappear, you know the type. Day one was difficult, everyone around me did the exact same thing except for the players (who obviously played basketball). I'd randomly appear in a press room where people were asking Blake Griffin questions after each game. I had no choice but to join in with the reporters. I'd ask the same questions every night, "how is your offense clicking," "you guys are executing well, is this a sign of things to come" every day, every game. There's nothing to do but wait for the press conference and watch the game. I tried playing basketball one day, it took one charge from Anthony Davis to know that wasn't gon na happen. I've started messing with the game a bit, running out onto the court naked, stabbing the mascot. There's really nothing else to say, I have no way out, no way to enjoy where I am and no way to die. I'm stuck. Help me.
