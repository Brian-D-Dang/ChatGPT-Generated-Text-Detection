My understanding of tenure is for professors to be able to do research and create lesson plans without the status quo getting offended and getting the professor fired. -i.e- doingteaching about stem cell research when it was huge hot-button issue (In the US) Federally funded schools have a by the book curriculum, which means they aren't doing research or creating lesson plans that go against anyone views. Tenure is not needed, by the definition I'm to understand - and it creates an unfair safety net when it's not needed. Is it to keep the schools from firing the higher paid older teachers in favor of younger lower paid ones? Why is this the only federal job that does this, if that's the case?
