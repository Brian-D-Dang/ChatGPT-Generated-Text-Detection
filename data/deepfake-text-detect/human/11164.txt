Those "other locations" are all either permanent sets that are just a few feet apart or temporary sets that are set up and torn down for a particular scene. An example of a temporary set would be, say, a scene in a car. A car shell is set up in front of a temporary blue screen (so the fake moving background can be added in post-production) for shooting. Here's a behind the scenes look at the sets for The King of Queens: URL1. You can see that all the various different roomsapartments are just lined up side by side on the soundstage. So the audience can see into any one of the "rooms." Also, here's an account of [being an audience member at Saturday Night Live] (URL0). It has a rudimentary 3D sketch of the studio that shows how most of the sets for the skits are side-by-side. tl;dr: all the sets are there in plain view of the audience even though the camera is only shooting on one set at a time. UPDATE: Just noticed that you said: if a TV show takes place in an apartment, but several scenes take place in other locations, everything comes together at the end with humorous references to what took place in those other scenes. First, that's pretty uncommon. It's pretty much only sitcoms that are taped before a live audience, and most such sitcoms are shot entirely on the soundstage. There are occasionally exceptions, like some Seinfeld episodes. Most of Seinfeld was taped on the soundstage, but any scene where you saw Jerry and the others walking down a New York Street was shot outside on the studio backlot. For those scenes they used laugh tracks, of course.', "I've been audience on a comedy show. The televised part lasted half an hour. The live show took a bit more than a full hour. Occasionally, when the comedy was tiring, the usher would stop the show and ask the audience to applaud. In the cut version, this applause could essentially be pasted over any discontinuity.
