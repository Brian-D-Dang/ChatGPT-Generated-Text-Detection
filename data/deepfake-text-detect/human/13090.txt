Bampf "Out the way..... out the way..." I shoved the robed summoners aside and ran for the little door in the domed hall. Kicking it open, I spun round, belt and waistband descending as I leapt back onto the seat. Ahhhhh. Just in time. 10 minutes later, I arose from the..... throne..... and (after washing my hands in the pewter basin) re-entered the hall. The candles flickered in a suitably threatening manner as I stalked towards my abducters. They shied away from my advance. "Why have you not fixed that spell yet?" I growled. "You know the side effects, you knew my request, and yet once again, I had to run to the bathroom to save my breeches from being breached." "We-we can't!" The lead sorcerer was flustered "The spell was written long ago by Sven, Trickster wizard of York. We..." he looked down to avoid my glare " ..... we don't know how it works, let alone unpick parts." I stared for a while, before sighing. Why couldn't I be summoned by competent wizards? "Fine. What is such an emergency that you need the Hero of Time?"
