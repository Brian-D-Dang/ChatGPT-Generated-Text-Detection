We have the remnants of the second set. Evolution tends to discard unneeded functions when possible. Being in the trees, not moving fast through water, air, or in sandysnowy environments, there's not a lot of reason to have a second set: our eyes do just fine with eyelids and eyelashes and tears as far as protection goes. Plus, we have nice dextrous fingers, and unlike a camel or a bird, we can get debris out of our eyes with them instead. They tend to be present on animals that can't well wipe their own eyes clean any other way.," "It's because humans don't have an evolutionary need for a second set. Animals like the seals have them to see under water and remove debris while not losing focus. Other animals, mammals specifically, like a polar bear, have them to prevent snow blindness and damage from UV rays. Woodpeckers tighten their nictitating membrane a millisecond prior to their beak impacting the trunk of a tree to prevent shaking-induced retinal injury. Humans just don't need them.
