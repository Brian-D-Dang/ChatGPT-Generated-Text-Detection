We show that for every l 1, there is a counterexample to the l -modular secrecy function conjecture by Oggier, Sole and Belfiore. These counterexamples all satisfy the modified conjecture by Ernvall-Hytonen and Sethuraman. Furthermore, we provide a method to prove or disprove the modified conjecture for any given l -modular lattice rationally equivalent to a suitable amount of copies of Z l Z with l {3, 5, 7, 11, 23 }. We also provide a variant of the method for strongly l -modular lattices when l {6, 14, 15 }.
