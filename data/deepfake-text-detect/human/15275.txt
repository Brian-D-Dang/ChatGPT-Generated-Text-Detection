Having already visited the Home Hardware store in Morningside, I was expecting to find more of the same at their sister store in Portobello. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this store offers much of the same and more. Firstly, this place is very large. I just about managed to fit it all into the photo! It covers everything that you could possibly need for your home. There's paint, DIY equipment, plants, home accessories and furnishings and more besides. They also provide a delivery service, meaning that there's no need to trek out to a BQ or Homebase, when a place as big as this is probably just on your doorstep. Honestly, I was impressed with this place. It crams in a lot of stuff, and will succeed in dragging people away from the big chains to something more local. These people are definitely getting it right in my opinion.
