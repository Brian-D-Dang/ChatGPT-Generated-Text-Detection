I understand that, given the size of the current outbreak much of the highly developed world is safe from large outbreaks starting with isolated travelers. However, there are huge swaths of the world that are not prepared to deal with Ebola, and all of those places can be reached by plane from infected areas within 24 hours. It looks like the outbreak will be continuing for sometime, well into next year as a very best case scenario. All it takes is 1 infected person landing in Calcutta or Mexico City and we could have whole new outbreaks due to the rampant overcrowding and poverty that exists in those areas. It's not clear to me at all how we are going to stop this from spreading everywhere given that people travel from Africa to locations all across the globe, and each one is a potential outbreak if they happen to go to a less developed region. How quickly would we even know an outbreak is occurring in such an area? The more it spreads, the more travel becomes a problem. If you have outbreak pockets on every continent, even the mostly highly advanced medical infrastructure would become overwhelmed eventually given unrestricted travel. I'd like to stop worrying about this, but it seems like we either start large scale quarantines soon (which isn't the plan), or this thing could easily get out of control. Hello, users of CMV!
