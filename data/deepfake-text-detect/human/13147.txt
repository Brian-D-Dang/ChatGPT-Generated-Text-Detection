"Dude, get pumped. This is a historic voyage. Soon we'll have a totally renewable power source. We're gon na save the planet, save so much money.." "Actually, it might not save that much money." "But coal is so expensive!" "And hype isn't? The TV ads alone are going to cost us in the thousands. Then there's tie-ins, merchandising, etc. Sure the first few trips will be easy enough, it's easy to get hyped about a brand-new kind of transportation. But eventually everyone will have ridden one already. Then where will the hype come from?" "We'll come up with something. Luxuries. Special guests. Some sort of sweepstakes maybe..." "Sure each of those things will work for a little while. Might buy us a month, maybe even a year. But pretty soon they'll be old news." "We'll have to keep adding more and more features..." "Exactly. But more than that we'll have to publicize them. Tease them gradually on our social media feeds. Get everyone hanging on our every word, waiting for the next big reveal. It'll work for a while. Marvel has kept it up for years.But eventually, no matter what we add, no matter how hard we try to make it new and exciting..." "The hype will run out." "Yup." "So what you're saying is hype..." "Is a non-renewable resource." "Damn." "Uh, why are we slowing down?"
