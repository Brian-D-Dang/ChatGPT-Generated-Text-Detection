The "under God" part was put in during the Cold War to distinguish the Christian US against the atheist USSR. The US are now at war with an extremist Muslim group, so by the same logic that got "under God" put in, we should distinguish ourselves against them by taking out the part that salutes the Muslim God. Any appeal to "That's the way it's always been, so we shouldn't change it" is illogical because, by that logic, we should never have changed the Pledge to include "under God" in the first place. edit: ucmvax has changed my view to "The pledge of allegiance is creepy and should be thrown out entirely."
