To me, it goes like this: When anyone says "no offense," they're trying to give you helpful criticism. I thought this was just widely accepted, but it's not, and I'm trying to understand why. If I pulled my friend aside at a party and said "dude no offense but you're being really obnoxious out there." Then I'm not insulting him. I'm letting him know he's being rude. I would want anyone to do that for me as well. I think getting offended at that, when they're specifically trying, and telling you they're trying, not to offend you but to give you advice, is pretty petty. It's like getting mad when a teacher edits your writing, you know you're putting yourself out there to be judged, why wouldn't you want to get better? Anyway, please help me understand why this is, I would appreciate it greatly, up until I learned people got offended by this, I said it once and a while, when I felt it was necessary, and now I feel about bad. (And sorry about any spelling mistakes or choppy sentences, I'm on my mobile.)
