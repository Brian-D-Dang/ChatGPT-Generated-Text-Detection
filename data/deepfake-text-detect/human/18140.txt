I often find that in most political discussions people chastise the Government or organizations for not doing enough to help insert disparaged party here, but have no intention of doing anything themselves to assist with the issue other than an upvote, like, or a critique. I feel that sentiment without action is completely useless in terms of solving a problem. Therefore I feel that a person who openly admits about not caring has as much impact on the situation as someone who espouses to have the solution or care but does nothing. I feel that they are morally equal as both have equal impact on the problem, none. EDIT: Be on in a few hours to reply, meetings and such....
