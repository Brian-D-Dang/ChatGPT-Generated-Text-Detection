It's a common situation. I'm in a crowded bar, engaged in a conversation with a friend, or perhaps a girl who caught my eye, about to deliver the punchline to a great joke. Suddenly, the butt end of a pool stick is invading my personal space, and the individual wielding it is looking expectantly at me, waiting for me to move so he can make his 'shot.' According to custom and good bar manners I must interrupt my conversation and move for his sake. I don't understand why their game is more important than my conversation. I don't think I should have to move for them - CMV. Let's postulate several things: 1) It's a Friday or Saturday night in an urban area in a popular bar. The bar is completely full. I can't reasonably go to another area of the bar, away from the pool table. 2) I had begun standing at my current location before the pool game started, i.e. I was there first. 3) The pool table is placed in a multi-use, common area of the bar rather than some kind of dedicated area. Thanks. I'd appreciate my view changed because this always really annoys me.
