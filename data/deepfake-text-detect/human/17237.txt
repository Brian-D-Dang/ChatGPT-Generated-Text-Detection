Today, talking on WhatsApp with someone new I just met a couple of days ago I realized that chatting is not the same nowadays than 5 years ago where people sat down in their computers on MSN or stopped anything they were doing to actually talk to someone else, now it's like you need to try very hard to get the attention of someone because people are usually entertained with something else happening in their daily lives and they turn to their phone's or change to their browser tabs where the chat is going on every time they had a chance. Or when they want to because now we can decide to ignore you or not thanks to notifications. The thing is that I now see texting only like a fast way to just deliver a message or arrange something and not as a mean to talk with someone just for the sake of talking, or like meeting someone new because that feel of attention you get when directly talking to someone's ear is simply not there. I prefer way more to do a phone call or talk face to face when I really feel like talking with someone. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
