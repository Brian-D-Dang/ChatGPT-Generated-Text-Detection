I am an 18 year old atheist male. I believe that abortion is not a matter of women's rights, it's a matter of morality. A common pro-choice argument I see thrown around is the fact that the baby is essentially leeching off the woman for 9 months against her will. I disagree with that entirely. In most cases, pregnancy is entirely the result of one's own actions. If steps were taken prior to sex, one would say that there is practically no chance to conceive a child. Therefore, pregnancy is a direct result of poor planning. Therefore, it's unjust to simply "opt-out" of having a baby. Barring cases of rape and the rare chance of protective measures failing, pregnancy is 100 a choice. It doesn't matter if it was an accident or not; it was your mistake, so you have no right to take the life of another human being. Also, I've seen the argument that the fetus is not a human being, as it's just a clump of cells that has the potential to become a baby. I disagree with this as well, as fundamentally speaking, if nothing is altered within the woman's body, the fetus will grow, and will be born. Nothing will halt this other than external actions (barring complications and so on). I don't understand how some people do not consider that "alive" or "human." However, I do believe that abortion should be allowed in cases where the mother's life is at risk if she were to give birth. At that point, the birth of the baby is directly putting the woman at risk, and she shouldn't be forced to go through that unless she chooses to. Besides the cases of rape and danger to the mother, I believe abortion is wrong and should not be an option. CMV.
