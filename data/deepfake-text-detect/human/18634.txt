I've never found him funny. It seems like he's all about the cheap laughs. He's always either screaming or being awkward. Nobody in their right mind could rank him among Ferrell, Rudd, Koechner or any of the actors he tries to keep up with. Have you seen Hope Springs? I kept wanting to think he was being funny in it but was left cringing. I feel like he got lucky and got in with the right crew but he's not half the personality of anybody on the Anchorman cast. I just can't get in to him. I'm curious to challenge my skepticism about him. CMV
