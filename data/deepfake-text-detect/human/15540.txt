What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said?? Easily the best food I've had in Montreal. I had the mac cheese, which was perfect. The mushrooms gave it a wonderful savory taste and the texture was something I didn't know I wanted until I had it. The accompanying salad was light enough on the dressing and very, very fresh. Well worth the trip downtown for me and I will be back. The only issue was price. My lunch for one of the mac and cheese, a small soda, and an almond croissant came to about 21. There was a lunch rush but as a single, I didn't have to wait at all for a seat at the counter.
