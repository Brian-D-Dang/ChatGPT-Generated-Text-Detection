In my opinion the current UN is not as useful as it could be. Theoretically a diplomatic forum for the worlds nations is a good thing, but the results have been less than hoped for. Since there is no real way to enforce decisions, it's mostly an exercise in idealistic global diplomacy. I think that science funding would be a better way to tackle global diplomacy. The UN would gather funds from member nations, and use it for science projects that are either too large or politically difficult for single nations to handle. The reason I think this would further diplomacy is because the findings would be credited to humankind. The next new element wouldn't be Polish, and the flag on Mars wouldn't be American. We would make scientific breakthroughs as humans of earth.
