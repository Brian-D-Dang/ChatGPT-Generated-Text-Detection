My friend and I thought it would be fun to try Pub 1842 for a light lunch, considering all we do is eat when we go to Vegas. I can't say that it was necessarily a light lunch, but it was delicious. The ambience is really fun, and we sat in a table toward the back of the restaurant where we had plenty of space to relax and unwind after a morning filled with shopping and walking. Our server suggested the Southside to start, and I was intrigued. They only make 15 large jars per day of this drink, so I decided to take advantage of this special drink. It's just beefeater, fresh lemon juice, and mint. Super delicious. Super refreshing. Of course I ordered a second drink. My friend had the pub's version of a moscow mule, and loved it. We shared the fried pickles, which were perfectly crispy and not greasy at all, and our server recommended the Greek salad and I was requesting lighter fare. The delectable lamb meatballs on the salad weren't exactly light, but I loved them. They definitely made the salad. I'm not sure how it would be for dinner, but everything I tried at lunch was very good.
