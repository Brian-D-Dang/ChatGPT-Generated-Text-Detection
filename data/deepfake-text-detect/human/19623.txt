I say this for 2 reasons: 1. Automatically raising the torch against pedophiles sends them into hiding and makes them harder to detect. If we offered some sort of societal acceptance, maybe we would better be able to tract and identify those who haven't yet committed a crime. 2. It must suck to be a pedophile. Many are victims of trauma themselves, and cant control their desires even when they know that society wants to murder them for it. It's probably like being driven to rape kids when you don't want to hurt kids and you know everyone's going to try to shoot you in the face afterwords. Hello, users of CMV!
