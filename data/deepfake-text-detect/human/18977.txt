The toaster ought to be considered 100 ridiculous and obsolete compared to the mighty toaster oven. Yet here we are in 2013 and millions of people still have a traditional toaster with that downright stupid design. What can you do with a toaster? Toast up to 2-4 slices of plain bread, maybe a bagel, as long as it conforms to its draconian size limits. That's it. Better hope it doesn't burn! What can I do with my toaster oven? Oh, I can do exactly that, while monitoring the progress through its superior glass front, plus about a million other things. Because it lays horizontally, I can put cheese and toppings on that bread and toast a sandwich. Can you cook bacon in your toaster? No? Because I can cook PERFECT fucking bacon in my toaster oven. Can you put your leftover pizza in your toaster and have it taste as if it was just freshly cooked? I will reheat your pizza BETTER than it was last night. Can you broil? Bake? Keep food warm? Because I can. So I can not only do what a toaster does, I can cook you a gourmet meal to go along with your toast using nothing BUT my toaster oven. You can get small ones, you can get cheap ones, so size and money shouldn't make a meaningful difference. If you believe in the toaster, you better start defending yourself. In fact, for 90 of cases I'd stack the toaster oven against the microwave!
