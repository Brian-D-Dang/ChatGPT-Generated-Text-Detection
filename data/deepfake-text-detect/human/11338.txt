A group of Instacart employees voted to unionize with the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1546 on Saturday. Managers distributed anti-union literature prior to the vote, claiming that a union would drain paychecks and have a great deal of control over workers. Most of Instacart's workforce are independent contractors, but around 12,000 workers are legally employees. Instacart has stated that it supports the action of its workers. Workers at Instacart do not receive healthcare and other benefits as their work hours are capped at 29 hours a week. The tech industry has seen unprecedented levels of organization amongst its workers recently. In the last few months, many companies have experienced worker-led strikes, protests, and online boycotts. The victory sends a message to other gig workers around the country who are fed up with working conditions at Silicon Valley tech companies.
