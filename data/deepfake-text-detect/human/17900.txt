After a brief discussion with my dad, I realized that there is little to no difference between child soldiers in Africa, and the children participating in military cadets program - other than the fact that one child soldier goes to war immediately, and the other waits til they are 'of age.' Why is it that we think it is unacceptable for third world countries to train their children and teenagers to be killers, when we are doing the exact same thing in first world countries through military cadet programs? Why are cadet programs viewed as moral, while we frown upon child soldiers?
