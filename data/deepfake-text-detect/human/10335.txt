I say "killer asteroid" in the title for brevity, but I mean any celestial object (asteroid, comet, planetoid, etc) large enough to wipe out life on Earth. I have three basic reasons: 1. We know there are no planet-destroyers in the Asteroid Belt, which means anything that'd take out Earth would need to come from the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud. Both of these are very far away, and would give us lots of warning, even if the object were presently on its impact trajectory orbit. More likely, we'd detect it multiple orbits in advance, and have decades or centuries before predicted impact. But I think we'll at least have multiple years. 2. Nuclear weapons would be pretty effective at deflecting an object. They are very energy dense, and [we can use a standoff detonation] to cause ablation on one side of the cometasteroid and nudge it. We only need a very slight nudge to push it off of an Earthbound trajectory when it is far away. 3. If an impact were imminent, humanity would throw all feasible resources into stopping it. A lot of the things which make present space travel difficult would be overcome fast. We would allow launches which have a high chance of spreading radioactive debris onto Earth for instance, or which have a high chance of loss of human life. We might even send astronauts on a suicide mission. Of course, money would be no object for this, and massive logistical resources would be poured into anything with a chance of saving us.
