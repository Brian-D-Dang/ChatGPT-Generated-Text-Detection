moon, month and menses are all basically the same word. A lunar month is full moon to full moon. At the same time women don't really get their periods every 28 days and that is just a good rule of thumb average, it's really anywhere between 20 to 40 days and some women aren't even the same every time and on average they don't match up with the moon in any way. But the average is somewhere around a month so people say a month.
