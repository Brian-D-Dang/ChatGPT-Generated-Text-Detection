Just to make things clear this is specifically about me and people in similar situations. I can understand why university is useful for some people. I'm also not sure if this post follows the rules. It's pretty personal. Feel free to delete if you don't think its general enough. I'm not planning to go to university. Mainly because I'm struggling to even graduate high school. I don't think any university would accept me. Even if I eventually do finish high school. Even if I do go to university it would probably be way too exhausting. I can't even handle part time high school. I also don't think university would help me out in my career at all. My first choice is working in the music business. I know that trying to make it as a solo musician or band isn't reliable. That is why I'm studying music production right now. I'm also saving up my money in case I can't make as much money for any reason. I also plan to do street performing and sell some art I make. I know I can't rely on that for an income. If all that fails I don't really know what I should do. I know I'll be hard to hire because of my extremely low energy level and focus. I'm pretty sure university won't help because I keep hearing it won't guarantee a job.
