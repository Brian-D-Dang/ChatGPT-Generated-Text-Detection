I am currently a science student and have had my fair share of dissections of dead animals taken from abattoirs, fish markets and the like. I have never dissected a live animal under anaesthetic to perform cardiovascular and respiratory tests, and one that has been specifically grown for the lab. I enjoy a good steak and am from a farming background so I have shot animals (foxes) to stop them killing other native species. I have no issue with animal testing in research science as to me that is justified in the discovery of new drugs, procedures that can save many lives. However something about live animal labs for students seems unnecessary as it is covering fairly obvious and well known ideas and the animals are not being treated with any respect - merely a tool to get results.
