First off, I'm not going to go into the reasons for invading another sovereign country. It happened, and I'm one of the "casualties" of the war. The point I'm trying to make is that as a result of it, had we should have followed through completely. It would have been a great thing. I think that while it was the Bush administration, from an even that happened when I was in 8th grade, It could have ended up as a good thing without a sudden withdrawal. Like I said, not going into the reasons, but at the height of US presense in the country, the only opinion I had gotten from people was hope. I talked to dozens of Iraqis, from business owners to drug addicts, and even 5 years after the initial invasion, they were happy with the terrible things that happened as a result of Saddamn getting overthrown. Please, change my view as to why we completely left the country which is now in anarchy. Edit, Edit: I don't have enough energy to debate this, however I will read every post that's in here. After getting an automod post, I will try to respond to valid points the best that I can. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
