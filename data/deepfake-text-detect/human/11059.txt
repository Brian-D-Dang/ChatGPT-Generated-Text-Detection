The part of the brain that controls breathing (the medulla oblongata) stays active while you are unconscious. This part controls involuntary breathing. This is why it's not possible without a ton of practice to take control over things like heart rate and breathing; there are safeguards in place so that people don't, for example, forget to breathe.," "You can also breathe when you're sleeping and 90 of the time you're awake you're also breathing involuntarily. You don't need to think about breathing to do, your brain does it for you.," "When you go unconscious, it's kind of like turning off your monitor rather than your CPU. So all the background functions are still working properly, but there's a blank screen.,Part of your nervous system, the [autonomic nervous system] (URL0), is responsible for making sure the body keeps doing things like breathing, heart pumping, food digesting. It keeps things running, even if you are sleeping, passed out, or blackout drunk. It functions like a reflex, there is no thinking about it, it just happens.
