If you had ever met Phil, you would know from the moment that his blubbering lips opened and his putrid breath wafted in the vicinity of your nose as the squealing pitch of his voice grated on your last nerve that he was born to be despised and loathed the world over. Hence, it was not a surprise that he was a popular choice for many when it came to choosing their nemesis. For me, it could only be him. He was all my pet peeves rolled into one greasy vile package. He was the nails on my chalkboard and the fly in my soup. It was meant to be and he would be mine. The grand seduction started last week when I vandalized his car. It continued with many other small events. I took the last donut from the staff room. I broke his favourite mug. I hacked into his Facebook and put a video of him from last year's Christmas party when he was so drunk he peed his pants. The final step was today. I checked the clock on the bedside table and it said 5:35. He would be walking in the door any moment. I couldn't wait to see his facial expression when he took in the scene before him. His wife Marg was passed out in the bed beside me, naked as the day she was born. His son was across the foot of the bed snoring and his daughter was passed out in the bathroom. It had been a family affair. I heard the sound of the front door opening and keys being set on the table. And then, the sounds of his clumsy footsteps up the stairs. I grabbed the ring and kneeled down on the floor as he opened the door. As he took in the scene, his face turned beet red and started swearing. "Phil," I started. "I fucking hate you with a passion. Every time I see you I want to punch you and I think your existence should be wiped from the planet. Let's make this official: be my nemesis. " I slid the ring on his middle finger, grimacing at the grime underneath his nails. And waited for his reaction. "Of course," he replied with a sneer. "You fucking cocksucker. "Then he sealed the deal, punching me in the jaw.
