Someone I know wrote: What matters to me is that SCOTUS does what it's supposed to dowhich is weigh in on law by precedent and constitutionality. NOT make up new rights that its justicesor popular opinionthink should be there (cough as in right to privacy in Roe v Wade cough). I think popular opinion is for gay marriage, and I am OK with that. I just don't want SCOTUS influenced by opinion. I am in support of equal marriage rights. I'm posting this as a devil's advocate in compliance with guideline VI.: How would you approach this position?
