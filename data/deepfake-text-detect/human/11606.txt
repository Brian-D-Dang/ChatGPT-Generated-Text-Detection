Apple Glasses could have the ability to transform any surface into a virtual touch interface, according to a patent that the company filed back in 2016. The patent describes using infrared heat sensing to detect where a user has touched a real-world object. Apple could use this system to allow Apple Glasses to project controls over real-world objects. As with all patents, Apple might not end up using the technology in its final product.
