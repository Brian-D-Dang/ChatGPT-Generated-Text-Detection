This is about to be a bold claim but bear with me. I do not believe a straight male as any more 'rights' than a gay male. The law applies universally such that both are bound by the same marriage laws. They cannot marry anyone under a certain age, they cannot marry multiple people at once (polygamy), and both cannot marry another male, etc.
