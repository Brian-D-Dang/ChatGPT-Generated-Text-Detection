By other similar places, I mean places where silence is expected from the audience. Examples: Movie theaters Libraries Courtrooms Theaters Classrooms Probably other places I didn't come up with Anyhow, I'll stick to movie theaters because it affects me the most currently. Every time I go to the movies, there will always be several commercials like [this] telling people to turn off their cellphones prior to the movie starting. However, I almost always experience people talking on their cells during the movie. It's really rude that people can't wait 2 hours at most to use their cellphones. It's inconsiderate to everyone else who are trying to watch the movie. So I feel that if people aren't going to make the choice to ignore their cellphones for 2 hours, then the choice must be made to install tech that forces them to go elsewhere and not disturb everyone with their calls. This applies to the other similar places where silence is expected. Theaters? Watch the playopera. Classrooms? Pay attention to the teachers. Courtrooms? Pay attention to the court cases. My first CMV inspired by entry 18 of [this Cracked photoplasty] Edit: you changed my view. Emergency response would be affected greatly by this. I still wish theaters cracked down on people talking on their cells. Like the [Alamo Drafthouse] . If one opened up near me, that theater would have my business all the time.
