Ex-Manchester United trainee McGinty, 21, played 13 times for the Conference club after joining on loan in February. "It's a fantastic move for me at this stage in my career. I want to push on here," McGinty told the club website. Meanwhile, 35-year-old goalkeeper Phil Smith, who was the Shots' first-choice stopper for 2014-15, has agreed a new one-year contract with the club.
