I went to the new Salad and Go on Higley and Williams Field Rd. It just opened a couple of weeks ago and was excited to see what it was all about. I ordered the cobb salad and was very disappointed. First there was lots of lettuce and it looked clean and fresh. However the rest of the ingredients were very much lacking: eggs, blue cheese crumbles (almost none), bacon (chopped so fine and spooned on to) and 1 very tiny slice of avocado. There were lots of tomatoes. Since I didn't open it until I got home I was pleasantly surprised at the size. That being said they gave one little container of water downed blue cheese dressing. No way would it have dressed the entire salad. I was willing to pay the 5.69 for the salad but did not get my money's worth with the extra ingredients for sure. I will go back and order a different salad to see if I can get a 5 star salad next time. I would certainly look closely at the list of ingredients and compare it to what you actually get.
