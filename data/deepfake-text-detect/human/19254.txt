The people on the show turn up to that house with the intention of raping a child. All the show does is display them arriving, giving an interview, and being arrested. If those three events happened, why shouldn't they have been filmed and broadcasted? It's legal to film people under any other circumstances, why not when they are potentially trying to commit a crime? Even if it is just potentially, the idea that the video should only be released once they are found innocent is ridiculous. We don't apply that logic to any other crime. Thanks to the show, there are fewer potential rapists at large in society. I think that's a very noble contribution. I also think this because the show is very entertaining. I'm aware that this isn't a rational reason for holding a view, and is probably a bias more than anything, but one way or another it factors into my reasoning. Anyway, I'm fully open to having my view changed here. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
