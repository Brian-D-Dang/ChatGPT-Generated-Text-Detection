Oh Caps. I used to love you! You upgraded your TV's and downgraded your service. Last year I loved going there for early football games with my family. We'd eat breakfast and watch football. Everyone was so accommodating, and friendly. They would put the game we wanted to see on next to the table we were sitting at. Food was great. Service excellent. This year, totally different story. Last week we went at dinner time for the NFL opening game. The service was horrible. They weren't even busy but our order was wrong, and we got over charged. We thought we'd try again this morning, and again were disappointed. They won't change the channels of the TV's, and they don't play every game. If they don't have your game on you are out of luck. Really a bummer because we used to love this place.
