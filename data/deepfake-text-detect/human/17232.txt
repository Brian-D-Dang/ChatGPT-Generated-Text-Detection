As kids, when we played games of soccer, basketball and other sports, it was pretty universally recognised that the fairest way to make teams was two captains took turns to pick players, so each team got an even amount of the good players, before the useless guys were picked according to a ratio of how crap they were compared to how good friends they were with the captain. However, the kid who got to pick first was always at a huge advantage. He always got the best player there, and if there were an odd number of players, he got an extra player too. It also knocked on in terms of player quality; he had the third best guy, while the the second team had the fourth best, and so on. Sure, second pick usually got to kick-off, but that's not enough to make up for the inherent advantage first pick had. My PE teacher in secondary school had a solution to this imbalance. One team picked first, as normal, but on the other team's first pick, they got to choose two players. The first team then choose two players, and then things went back to normal (so the second team picked one, first team picked one, etc). This meant one team had the best, fourth best and fifth best player, while the other had the second, third and sixth best, which is a much more fair spread of talent. It might take 20 seconds longer to explain to the neighborhood kids than the standard method, but I think this method leads to much fairer teams, and therfore more fun games. CMV!
