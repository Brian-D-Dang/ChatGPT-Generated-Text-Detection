It buys TV ads and can be used to open offices country wide and staff the and even hire canvassers. Scott Walker, who won the Wisconsin recall, had so much money, he paid people to go door-to-door to ask for support (nearly all campaigns have volunteers do this) and it worked. Money isn't everything, even with all the money he had, Romney had a hard time winning the nomination because there wasn't that much enthusiasm behind, unlike some other Republican contenders and there was even a point where his campaign was short on cash because most of his supporters already donated the maximum amount so he just had to depend on his superPAC (which had oodles of cash) to get him through. Though, thanks to that money, he just swamped primary states with cash, outspending his opponents 10 to 1 in some cases.
