Red Carpet Entertainment LLC is offering 3,000 rich Americans the chance to put up 15,000 and pay up to 2,500 per movie to watch the latest releases in their homes. The serviced was created to target the ultra-rich in a way that wouldn't disrupt the market. Most of the revenue from subscriptions goes back to the studios. Other high-end pre-screening services have not gained traction. Red Carpet Entertainment has almost 100 customers. Customers will pay at least 500 per movie and will be able to see the movie twice in a 36 hour period.
