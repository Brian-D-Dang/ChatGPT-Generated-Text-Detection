Its so hypocritical. Smoking weed is still smoking. I see it as equivalent to someone saying they won't talk to someone who drinks, unless they only drink Rum because that is OP's favorite drink. I see it all the time on Grindr and immediately it makes me assume that the other guy is a douche. It makes them seem elitist, like they are superior to people who smoke cigarettes because 420 is illegal or something. I use Grindr to find friends btw, I have a bf so I don't hook up on there. But it still annoys me how many guys refuse to talk to anyone who smokes if it isn't weed. It's so hypocritical. Please cmv Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
