The sunset was very dark red Jerrick thought as he hung by his feet from an oak, possibly in part due to the blood rushing to his head and the impending loss of consciousness. A heavy footstep cracking a kindling branch announced a person's arrival, Jerrick swallowed hard his French was no use in this region at this time where Occitane ruled. In fact the French he spoke was not welcomed and marked him as an invader from the north. "allo there chum, looks like you're in a pickle and no mistaking that my friend" said voice dripping in sarcastic cheer, Jerrick found himself looking at a rough looking codpiece at his eye level. "now I should tell you, you haven't failed technically not your fault you're two hundred clicks from where you should have been and strung up by your ankle. But the schmucks here thought you were legit enough to want to kill you so bravo you pass as a regular person" Jerrick jerked awake winded laying on his back, the rag wrapped feet were by his face. "you passed out so I cut yet poor arse down, once you feel like you can stand we got ta scarper down to the river and book it outta here, we'll meet up with a chrono-marshal and be home in time for you to get grilled by the faculty" Edit: Just realised I have written this before on another post. Dang it. Nearly the same thing.
