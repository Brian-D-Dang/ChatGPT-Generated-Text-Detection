It picks up dirt and debris from the ground, and it has water in it from the storm as well as from the ground. It is far more than just spinning wind.','Imagine a tornado as one BIG vacuum. It goes around sucking up everything that isn't nailed down. Things like houses, cows, cars, and dirt; Lots and lots of dust, dirt, and sand. So much so that it makes the tornado itself visible! Not only is it because of dust, but also it sucks around some of the cloud it's in too! For this reason, tornados don't always look like you think they would and it can even become difficult to tell where exactly the 'center' of the tornado is, even with proper equipment!
