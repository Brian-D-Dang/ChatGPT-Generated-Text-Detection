I watched this documentary at school called JFK - the smoking gun and they calculated the trajectory of the bullets, the fragmenting of the bullet, and the likelihood of shooting two bullets in the frame of 6 seconds at a target, and the evidence was pretty conclusive that he was killed by the FBI guy behind, accidentally mind you. Do most people know this? There was also a huge coverup in the medical centre following the shooting, which is very shifty. Does anyone trust this documentary? I quite like it and it's amazing that the American government still hasn't admitted that it was the fbi agent that killed him. But the important question is, was there a cover up? Surely after 50 years or so we should have the real answers out here, especially with all this technology. EDIT: Ok, I guess I should have clarified what the documentary said. Oswald shot twice, trying to kill the president, but his shots were not fatal. The FBI agent in the car behind stood up, and then rushed and accidentally shot JFK, in the head.
