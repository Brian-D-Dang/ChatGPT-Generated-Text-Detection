One of the biggest daily uses of water in my house is having everybody shower every day. I cringe to imagine that this same scenario is happening accross most every other house in my country. Here in reddit i once read the concept of a "Mexican bath" which is to wash the parts that show and stink daily (Your face, hands, genitals, ass and probably armpits) and be done with it. This is even better for hair which supposedly is damaged by too much cleaning. Maybe some of you may argue that it helps you feel awake in the mornings, but that's not a very good reason, is it? More than changing my view, i'm interested in knowing if there are decent reasons to justify daily showering for people who don't get very dirty or sweat a whole lot everyday for some reason. But of course if there's a really good argument i can definitely change my view.
