The video that scared the shit out of me and made me realize this can be found [here] . Basically, here is the logic conveyed in the video: automation is reaching a point that the majority of low-payinglow-skill jobs will be run by robots. This means that a significant portion of the population of the US will be unemployed with no income and will be stagnant in the economy. The income gap will increase, with the men owning the companies employing robots owning a very large majority of all the money in the US. My opinion is not that there are no solutions, but that our current democratic system and the gridlock in Congress will mean that solutions will never see the light of day because politicians are looking for votes and not the betterment of the country. Please tell me I am wrong and the government will address this pressing issue so that we will be ready for this massive change in the economy.
