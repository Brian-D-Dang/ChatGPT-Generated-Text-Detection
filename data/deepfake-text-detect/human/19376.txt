Mother's Baby Father's Maybe. I think that paternity testing should be mandatory in all cases where a man wishes to put his name on the birth certificate. Quite simply: Eliminates the chance of unwilling cuckoldry Means that males who are unsure of whether they are the father can find out without potentially blowing up a relationship If it were mandatory women in 'more stable' relationships would be more careful with protection with whomever they were cheating with as if they got pregnant they would be found out. Frankly I can't think of a reason why this could be a bad idea for any reason other than to save health services money. But its not even that expensive!
