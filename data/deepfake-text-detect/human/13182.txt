He held the book in his hands, unsure for the briefest of moments what he should do with it. He had recognized it for what it was within seconds of picking it up. An autobiography that he had not authored, yet the words were his own. The few pages he had read were written in precisely his style, too close to be a clever prank. It told of things he had never committed to paper, nor to words. He closed his eyes and thought. He thought of pouring over mistakes he had yet to make, and correcting them. He thought of divining his death, and avoiding it. He thought of paradoxes and possibilities, of metaphysics and free will. He placed the book back on a shelf. "There is, perhaps, such a thing as too interesting a read." he whispered to himself.
