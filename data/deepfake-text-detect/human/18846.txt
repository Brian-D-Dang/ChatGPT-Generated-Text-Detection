In the UK people who support UKIP are politically illiterate and ignorant of what reality is really like. I don't know how we should deal with them. But it's like right now we're on a boat that is sinking and they're really worried that it's being caused by voodoo or some nonsense. I know the UK has a massive problem with political literacy, just check out our fucking subs here on reddit, AAV did a lovely blog post on the problem and here are some lovely stats from 1. Teenage pregnancy: on average, we think teenage pregnancy is 25 times higher than official estimates: we think that 15 of girls under 16 get pregnant each year, when official figures suggest it is around 0.6[i]. 2. Crime: 58 do not believe that crime is falling, when the Crime Survey for England and Wales shows that incidents of crime were 19 lower in 2012 than in 200607 and 53 lower than in 1995[ii]. 51 think violent crime is rising, when it has fallen from almost 2.5 million incidents in 200607 to under 2 million in 2012[iii]. 3. Job-seekers allowance: 29 of people think we spend more on JSA than pensions, when in fact we spend 15 times more on pensions (4.9bn vs 74.2bn) [iv]. 4. Benefit fraud: people estimate that 34 times more benefit money is claimed fraudulently than official estimates: the public think that 24 out of every 100 spent on benefits is claimed fraudulently, compared with official estimates of 0.70 per 100[v]. 5. Foreign aid: 26 of people think foreign aid is one of the top 2-3 items government spends most money on, when it actually made up 1.1 of expenditure (7.9bn) in the 201112 financial year. More people select this as a top item of expenditure than pensions (which cost nearly ten times as much, 74bn) and education in the UK (51.5bn) [vi]. 6. Religion: we greatly overestimate the proportion of the population who are Muslims: on average we say 24, compared with 5 in England and Wales. And we underestimate the proportion of Christians: we estimate 34 on average, compared with the actual proportion of 59 in England and Wales[vii]. 7. Immigration and ethnicity: the public think that 31 of the population are immigrants, when the official figures are 13[viii]. Even estimates that attempt to account for illegal immigration suggest a figure closer to 15. There are similar misperceptions on ethnicity: the average estimate is that Black and Asian people make up 30 of the population, when it is actually 11 (or 14 if we include mixed and other non-white ethnic groups) [ix]. 8. Age: we think the population is much older than it actually is - the average estimate is that 36 of the population are 65, when only 16 are[x]. 9. Benefit bill: people are most likely to think that capping benefits at 26,000 per household will save most money from a list provided (33 pick this option), over twice the level that select raising the pension age to 66 for both men and women or stopping child benefit when someone in the household earns 50k. In fact, capping household benefits is estimated to save 290m[xi], compared with 5bn[xii] for raising the pension age and 1.7bn[xiii] for stopping child benefit for wealthier households. 10. Voting: we underestimate the proportion of people who voted in the last general election - our average guess is 43, when 65 of the electorate actually did (51 of the whole population) [xiv]. but fuck everything your average UKIP supporter is concerned about is based on what most people who know how to use google know is nonsense. 75 70 of our laws don't come from the EU, thats completely made up by UKIP. They use a quote taken completely out of context. It's only people who don't know what the fuck they are talking about who really favour UKIP. Does my bloody tits in. Please change my view. I can't stand discussing politics on this site anymore because I'm convinced everyone on it is either a troll or moron when they start talking about UKIP positively. Hello, users of CMV!
