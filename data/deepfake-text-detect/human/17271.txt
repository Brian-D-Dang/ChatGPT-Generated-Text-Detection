So, first things first: I want to make it clear that the person who is at fault for his death is IS, the group who killed him. Having said that it seems completely insane to have traveled there at all. He had a 3 week old daughter for goodness' sakes, and another young daughter, too. It should be groups of people who can protect themselves who should be getting involved. I'm not necessarily saying it should be or has to be an official military group, but there should be back-up, communications, plan Bs, support... He deliberately put himself in harm's way, costing his two baby girls and his wife unimaginable heartache and pain, not to mention the rest of his friends and family. It just seems so reckless! EDIT: Well, as of right now my view remains unchanged, but I will continue to read the responses and think on it. I just can't over the fact that he risked his life when he had a brand new baby. That, by definition, seems reckless to me. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
