Disclaimer: this talk of secession may not be present everywhere in the United States, but it is more than prevalent where I live, so I'm going off that. To me, secession is crazy talk. Not only are Southern states often some of the most poor (the poorest being Mississippi), but the United States would have control of the entire military of the United States of America. That's, well, a lot. I talked to someone who believed the South should secede and that "we" (the South) would win because "now [the South] has all the guns and more than half of the major military bases." To address this, first of all, it's not as if the military suffers from a chronic lack of arms. The United States, I'm sure, has ways of attaining weapons that it doesn't already have. Second of all, it doesn't matter if you have half the major military bases. First of all, define "major." Second of all, the other side would still have half of them, AND a higher population, AND more money, AND probably the support of many foreign nations (because who would want to side with the South, who would seem like backwoods racists). The South would crumble, just as it did in the 1860's. CMV.
