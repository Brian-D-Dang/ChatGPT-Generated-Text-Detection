While many things brought about the great Digg migration that led to the explosion of popularity in Reddit (e.g. v4.0), the increased influence of power users on which content was displayed seemed to be one of the biggest factors. Reddit has traditionally been a fairly open forum whose content is decided on by the average user, however it seems that the majority of front page submissions are made by power users who spam articles by the same sensationalist outlets over and over (cough Ars Technica cough). In addition to this, articles that criticize the interin-CEO of Reddit are mysteriously disappearing from their respective subreddits. The appeal of Reddit has largely been that its content is controlled by its users, however it seems that the control is now being put in the hands of a few select power users and moderators, and not the average Redditor. This appeal seems to be slowly evaporating and I believe it is only a matter of time until we hear about the "Great Reddit Migration of 20 ." I hope this doesn't happen, so please CMV.
