I don't believe there is anything innate within us that makes us different, like a soul or similar. Thus all our actions are determined by both our environment and our genetics, neither of which we have any control over (to a appreciable degree). So although it will be infinity complex to compute what someone will do, their actions are still predetermined. Also the first philosophy major who comes in here and points out that if our actions are predetermined then any discussion will have nothing to do with the truth and therefore it is pointless to discuss, gets a slap upside the head.
