We stayed here for two nights in July. Here's the break down: The good: 1) Super helpful staff, every person we came in contact with was fantastic. 2) Awesome in room hot tub 3) A fully appointed kitchen in our suite. The ability to eat in is actually very nice. 4) The layout of the Suite. We stayed in a one bedroom suite, we liked the separation of the living area and sleeping area. 5) Convenient distance to monorail station The bad: 1) The hike from self-parking to the the hotel, hauling luggage downstairs in 106 degree weather, no bueno. 2) the lay out of the actual hotel. Only saw two exitentrances both dead center of the hotel. It made for a lot more walking when staying in the wings. We did love our stay, we were very happy with our room and the experience in general. We planned the trip to be a no driving vacation, which it was. We parked the car when we got there and walked or took public transport everywhere we went. Had we been using the valet service, we probably wouldn't have noticed.
