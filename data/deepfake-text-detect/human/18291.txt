Every time I make a choice, I am simply determining what I want most. so my choices are always determined by the most desired option. Because I can not adjust my desires , my desires are out of control, but if I want to adjust my desire, doing THAT would be my greatest desire. If someone was born with my brain and my body and my upbringing, but they were the one that "felt" my consciousness, they would experience making all of the same choices that I do.
