I'd imagine some of the stuff that happens in sleep paralysis is at play here. When you're waking up, you're at the end of your rem cycle, but not quite out of it, and that's why you see your dream as you're waking up. In sleep paralysis, you wake up in the middle of your rem cycle, and are still, in your mind, dreaming. And, while your body is awake, your brain hasn't quite thought "hey, time to wake up," and that's why you're paralyzed. I could be wrong, but that's what could make sense to me.
