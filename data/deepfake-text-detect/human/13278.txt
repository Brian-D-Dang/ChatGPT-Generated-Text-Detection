"You know, Pickering," said the man, "first impressions are quite important when meeting new people, and can really be rather polarizing. For instance, if you saw this young man" - the stranger yanked one arm up to point to a passerby- "for the first time, you would think him to be almost a child in mental state, and would deal with him accordingly. Look, see! His youthful face and curly, unkempt dirt-blonde hair do nothing to dissuade that image, nor does his slight, gangly build. The dullness of his blue eyes speaks of the exhaustion that comes from a poor sleep schedule; however, it is the kind of exhaustion motivated more by an unwillingness to waste time sleeping than by any necessity. He would almost resemble a young boy, were it not for his height. Look at his behavior, too; he shuffles awkwardly, as though he does not know what he does or where he goes, and he averts his gaze from the eyes of others. See, now! He has reached the bus stop, and grows impatient already. He can not restrain himself; his fingers twiddle themselves, his feet tap rhythmically, and his eyelids fall shut. I'll wager, in his mind, he's all but forgotten the bus stop already, lost in some fantasy far more entertaining to him than the drudgery of the everyday."
