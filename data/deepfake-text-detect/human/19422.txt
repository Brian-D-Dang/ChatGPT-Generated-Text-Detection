The basic idea is to tax all land and natural resources at close to 100 of their rental value. This would essentially eliminate real estate speculation. At the moment, a lot of valuable land is held idle for speculative purposes. This tax would free up that land so that society can gain the economic benefits from its use. In the US, vacant houses outnumber homeless people. By making it expensive to hold on to land without using it, we could force those homes on to the market and make housing more affordable for everyone. Socially, this would be a way to resolve historical injustices. In the US, land was taken from the Native Americans. Countless countries all across the world have seen the exploitation of peasant farmers by wealthy landlords. In Zimbabwe, the issue with the white farmers shows the disasterous consequences of simply redistributing that land. At the same time, the new distribution is not necessarily more just. With a land value tax, we could use a percentage of the proceeds to create a basic income, so that all people will share equally in the land wealth of a country, regardless of history. EDIT: Forgot to mention that it's the least disruptive and most enforceable method of collecting tax I can think of. Land can't be offshored or hidden. It doesn't require a huge bureaucracy to spy on everyone's income. And if there is a "capital flight" away from the land of one country, that will just lower the value so someone else can use it.
