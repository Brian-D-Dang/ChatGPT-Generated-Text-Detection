I listen to the excellent Hardcore History podcast by Dan Carlin. In his episode on the Mongols, Dan highlights the atrocities committed by the Mongols, and also brings up the point that many revisionist historians are beginning to gloss over the negative parts of the Mongol legacy and emphasizing the "positive" aspects of the Mongol conquests including increased trade and the Silk Road. In Mongolia, I understand that Genghis Khan is still seen as a national hero. According to sources I have seen, the Mongol conquests under Genghis Khan killed between 10 to 15 million people. The population of Iran did not recover until the mid-20th century. The Mongol conquests included a large amount of the stereotypical rape, pillage, and plunder. I see no difference between the destruction and suffering brought by Genghis Khan and that of Adolf Hitler. I think they should be viewed in the same light by history. Is it just that Genghis Khan was successful and Adolf Hitler's Germany lost? Is history just the past seen through the eyes of the victor? Hello, users of CMV!
