Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has created a 2 billion fund called the Day One Fund to help homeless families and create a network of nonprofit preschools in low-income communities. It will fund existing nonprofits and issue annual awards to organizations doing "compassionate, needle-moving work" to shelter families. It will also operate a network of high-quality, full-scholarship Montessori-inspired preschools. Bezos wrote in a Tweet: "We'll use the same set of principles that have driven Amazon. Most important among those will be genuine, intense customer obsession. The child will be the customer." The fund will borrow its vision statement from Seattle charity St. Mary's Place: no child sleeps outside.
