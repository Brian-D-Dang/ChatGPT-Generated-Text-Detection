I've been living in the Downtown Eastside in Vancouver for awhile nowa famous section of Vancouver where open air drug dealing, prostitution and homelessness run rampant. However lately the area is becoming gentrified, with regions just a few blocks from the poorest areas becoming filled with culturally vibrant and wealthy businesses that exist in steep contrast to the poverty visible a few blocks up. The increasing gentrification of the area has caused much controversy, with "anti-gentrification" protests popping up to challenge upcale housing and restaurant projects. However I can not bring myself to agree with these protests. I understand that the factors contributing to "skid row" urban environments is complex and multi-faceted, yet the more I live in a poor urban area, the more I believe that the urban environment itself is a major contributor to the severity of the social problems experienced within them to begin with. I believe gentrification is a good thing because it forces low-income people to resettle into areas where there is less prevalent social acceptance of drug use. This displacement makes it more difficult for them to find like minded individuals who will encourage behaviours like using needles to inject drugs. As a consequence, their social outcomes improve despite getting displaced. I know many who regard gentrification as a bad thing. Please convince me again why I should believe that gentrification is bad.
