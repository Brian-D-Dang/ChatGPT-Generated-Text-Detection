Dear Max Brenner, I chose you to be my place as my 21st birthday in Vegas. I trust your quesadilla, pasta, and fondue. I'm writing this message just to let you know how grateful I am to make such a great decision. Your service is excellent and my to-go chocolate pizza is far above from what I expected to be good! Thank you!!!! I am willing to go back to Vegas just to get to your place again. Sincerely, YOUR NEW FAN
