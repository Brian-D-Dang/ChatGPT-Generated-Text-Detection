My belief that the ethical worth of an action depends on its consequences for happiness and suffering informs my perspective on this issue. Because it does not necessarily cause more suffering than it alleviates, suicide is not inherently unethical. Even in instances when the depression of the suicidal person is mild, suicide can be ethically permissible. People do not have ethical obligations to their future selves, because those future selves are non-existent. Human actions do not happen in a vacuum. Since we are social beings living in a social context, our actions often have unintended consequences. Suicide is only unethical when surviving loved ones suffer as a result of the suicide. Suicidal people who leave notes that provide closure to friends and family, or who gradually distance themselves from loved ones, mitigate the suffering caused by their suicide and thus increase its moral worth. Happiness and suffering are impossible to precisely quantify, but if a rational person would conclude that the actual suffering of a suicidal person exceeded the potential suffering of surviving loved ones, the suicide would be ethically permissible. The last surviving man on Earth could commit suicide with ethical justification. A single mother who was beloved by her community and experiencing a temporary rough patch would be wrong to commit suicide. Waiting to die rather than choosing to die is not ethically obligatory. The philosophical arguments against suicide qua suicide contain sophistry that disguise unjustified taboo morality.
