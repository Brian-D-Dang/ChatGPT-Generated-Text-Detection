Atheists in general believe that when you die, you just cease to exist. There is nothing afterwards Even tough I am not religious, I think that it's foolish to assume that. If we assume assume that when we die, our brains stop working, we stop thinking and therefore lose track of time, then time becomes irrelevant. Just like when someone is in a coma and wakes up 4 years after without knowing how long it had been or just what happened exactly Our minds simply cannot comprehend non existence. We will only regain consciousness that we were dead when we "live" again, either in a physical way or spiritually. Basically, if there is no afterlife, we have no way of knowing it. As long as we don't assume that time is infinite, there will be some sort of afterlife. Still, I would like to hear opinions on the other side of the spectrum. CMV EDIT: My view has been changed. Even if there is some sort of life afterwards, it cannot count as after life since we simply will not be the same. Actually, this is all just too much information (and complicated info at that) and I can't wrap my head around not being conscious, as that's the only way of being we have been.
