I do not believe there is any form of lobbying group more stupid than a teacher's union. Where I am from (Ontario, Canada) they are paid stupid amounts of money to babysit. The purpose and intent in the formation of union was to secure a safe working environment at good wages for workers. Workers who had jobs which put themselves at known occupational health and safety risks. Miners, steelworkers, construction workers, factory workers, all deserve unions. There are OHS risks associated with their jobs. What does a teacher risk? We pay them professional wages to teach elementary kids how to read and write. How is that difficult? Plus they get a year salary for working 8 bloody months of the year. Oh, and the one thing that gets me is the fact that you can't fire them for being bad at their job! I essentially think teachers are a bunch of pretentious hippies who 'sculpt the minds of the leaders of tomorrow.' I'm biased because I went to a private school, I had great teachers because if they sucked they were immediately fired, even halfway through the school year. But anyways, I try and stay open minded and I have never heard what I viewed as a reasonable argument against this. So if you are up for it, CMV? I'd like to thank everyone who had legitimate point.
