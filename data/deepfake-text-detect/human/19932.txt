Something I see come up a lot in music discussion threads, whether on Sputnik Music , rMusic, or even a more niche sub like rPostHardcore, is that being very specific with genres is an annoying thing. This is an especially large joke in extreme metal discussions where there are multitudes of different sub-genres. I think these are great. If you like a band with a specific sound and you want to find more bands like them your best bet is to search for bands in the same genre. Being vague or broad with genres is a great way to not find more bands like the ones you're looking for. For example, say I like Protest the Hero and want to find more bands like them. They have a lot of influences in their style but could be chalked up into the umbrella genre of "metal." If I search "metal" I will get a ton of bands that sound absolutely nothing like Protest the Hero. Even narrowing it down to "Progressive Metal" still gets a lot of bands that aren't very similar, like Opeth. But if I search for "Mathcore" which is a lot more specific I can find bands that sound a lot like them. There's no reason for the disdain of genres. No one complains about when movies get a million genre tags Example] but when bands do they get annoyed and I can't see why. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
