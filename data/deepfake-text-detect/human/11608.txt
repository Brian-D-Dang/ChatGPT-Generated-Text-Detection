Uber is allowing its customers to see what ratings they have received from drivers. Customers will be able to see their ratings in the app's new privacy menu. Uber uses the rating system to police its users. A low rating can result in both drivers and riders being kicked off the platform. Uber released a list of cities with the highest and lowest ratings. New York City came in first for the lowest average rider rating among large US cities.
