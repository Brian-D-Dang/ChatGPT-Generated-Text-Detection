Medicare is a Federal program for those who are over 65 or are disabled. To obtain it you, or a spouse, must have worked a specific number of quarters paying into social security, or been categorized as disabled by Social Security. Medicare covers 3 different things. Part A covers hospital visits and emergencies. Part B covers doctors and general medical visits, and Part D covers prescription drugs. Part C plans are Medicare Advantage plans, external plans that have a minimum coverage level equal to parts A and B but normally cover more as well. Part D is administered through external sources as well, the same companies that provide Part C plans. Medicaid are state administered low income and disability programs that help pay for medical coverage. Source: I work in Medicare and Retirement insurance.','Medicaid is for low-income people.
