Firstly, mathematics, first and second language are the basis of any other courses, they are like the tools that let you solve problems related to any field. Giving these tools earlier to the children will make it easier for them to apply. Secondly, philosophy will assure that all children are as mature as they should be at their age while also bringing them some historic knowledge. Finally, in this society based on the massive use of electronic devices and telecommunications, IT should be taught so that everyone understand the basis of what they are using everyday extensively for security and practical reasons. EDIT: My view has been changed thanks to this great community. I understand that philosophy and extensive IT can't be taught to children that age and I also see that I forgot to include art and physical education. TL;DR: Philosophy is not something children can learn since their brain is not developed enough. Math, first and second language were approved to be really important in education. IT should be taught in a way to teach children how to use the technology they use everyday at their fullest without necessarily going in depth in the computer science field. Art and physical education should be taught to children. A general course that contains science, history, ethics and religion would be really beneficial to support the child's evolution through everyday life. Thank you everyone ! Hello, users of CMV!
