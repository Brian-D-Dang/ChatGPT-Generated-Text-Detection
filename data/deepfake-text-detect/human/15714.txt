I was in the Phoenix area for a week for work and stopped by in Tempe to meet a friend. She recommended Genghis Grill and we went there. The ambience was good and the waiter was friendly. The food was awesome too similar to flat top grill where you can create your own stir fry. Will go there again if I am in town again.
