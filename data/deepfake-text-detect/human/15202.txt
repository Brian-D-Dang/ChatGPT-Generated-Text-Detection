Nice cozy place to have lunch. The waitress was nice and attentive. I had the side ceasar salad it was very good but 7.00 was pricey! I had the parm panini. It was ok I felt that the ham was a bit to tough for me it should of been tender and thin sliced. The mozzarella and basil was the best part of the sandwich oh and was not warm enough. My cousin had the eggplant dish. She said it was actually good it looked good to. another problem we had here was that they did not have bread. You need bread some meals. We asked for some and I think they ran to bashas and bought an old baguette. they cut a piece off and then cut that into fours it was cold and stale. So overall I think its too pricey just for lunch food was ok the service was great. Thats why I give this place a 2. just because its in Verrado doesnt mean it deserves another star.
