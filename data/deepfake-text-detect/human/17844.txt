As a 6'8" person who often leaves airplanes with bruises on his knees it frustrates me that I can no longer freely change to an exit row seat. When peanut allergies became a common occurrence they stopped having peanuts on planes. This is how I view height. While in most cases in life it serves as an advantage, it is NOT a choice. I am sick of airlines treating it like obesity. Being tall is not a sign of poor life habits. I shouldn't have to pay more than the next guy just to not be in pain when flying. How is forcing people to pay more based on a trait you are born with fair?
