Cana has unveiled a drink machine that can synthesize almost any drink. The machine uses a cartridge that contains flavor compounds that can be combined to create the flavor of nearly any type of drink. It is about the size of a toaster and could potentially save people from throwing hundreds of containers away every month by allowing people to create whatever drinks they want at home. Around 30 million was spent building Cana's proprietary hardware platform and chemistry system. Cana plans to start full production of the device and will release pricing by the end of February.
