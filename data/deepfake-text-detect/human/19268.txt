Driving is a privledge that is earned, not a right. Our roads should only be filled with comptent drivers, because of how dangerous they can be when accidents happen. Driving under the influence and texting while driving are only made easier with automatics. Driving is esentially reduced to steering. Manuals force the driver to be more involved in the process, and require using both hands, making texting for the most part, not an option. If cars were only manuals, driving related deathsaccidents would drastically fall on account of drivers actually having their eyes on the road and their mind on the task at hand. I'd imagine plenty of people wouldn't want to always drive a manual or would be unwilling to learn. There would be a higher demand for high quality public transportation which would be another benefit for society while also reducing usage of fossil fuels.
