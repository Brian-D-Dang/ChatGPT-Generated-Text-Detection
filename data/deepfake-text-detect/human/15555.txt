I tried this place for the first time today. I heard about it from a flyer left on my car. I had always gone to spring moutain to get really good Pho, but I was excited to see this place on our side of town. I tried a couple of items, the shrimp rolls in rice paper were wonderful and fresh and I loved the peanut sauce. There was also a selection of different types of non-alcoholic drinks meant to referesh the palate. I tried the ginger iced tea lemonade and it was wonderful I had never had anything like it and can't wait to have it again. I had the special PHO with the satay and it was yummy, a nice spice but not too spicy. The prices were very reasonable and everything was fresh. I can't wait to go back and try the other items.
