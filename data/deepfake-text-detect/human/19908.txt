As an agnostic and someone who's actively looking for spiritual explanations for the unexplainable (like consciousness or before the big bang or we), I can't help but feel a little sad for those who have the firm belief that science and religion are incompatible. The atheist community (and i'm not just talking about ratheism) has shown again and again that they have no interest in trying to provide or look for answers in any way considered even remotely unorthodox. There is so much in the world that is completely beyond explanation (I always like to go to the "what is consciousness made of" argument) that it really makes no sense that there's such a huge group of people dedicated to completely disregarding or often attacking theories not considered academically "correct" change my view
