After watching the documentary [Happy, (2011) ] (available on Netflix) and reading blog posts made at , especially the excellent 5 part article-series titled The Growth Ponzi Scheme, I've come to believe that the suburbs are not only unsustainable, but the bubble is likely to 'pop' soon, as municipalities are finding it harder and harder to raise money to fund maintenance on existing infrastructure, let alone pay for new construction. For example, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that our current infrastructure is going to require [5 Trillion worth of repairs in the next five years alone] , and no politicians are even discussing how we're going to pay for it. This also only accounts for major infrastructure, and doesn't account for new infrastructure. The reason why I'm posting this here is because I've never really heard a strong case for suburban living. Most people think it's 'cheaper,' but that's only because costs are deferred by local, state, and federal governments in a myriad of ways. I'm not an urban planner or civil engineer, but I want to know if is correct in it's conclusion about the suburbs. The film Happy opened me up to the feasibility of Bus-rapid Transit over existing transportation types such as cars (which i absolutely despise), as well as bicycling (as showcased in Denmark and the Netherlands), and the idea of [cohousing] , something that I plan on looking into partaking in sometime in the future (unless of course someone changes my view). Any sources or information you can provide would help me a lot. Thank you rchangemyview!
