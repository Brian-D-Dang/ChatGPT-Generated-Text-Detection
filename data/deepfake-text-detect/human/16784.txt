We consider the problem of robustly recovering a k -sparse coefficient vector from the Fourier series that it generates, restricted to the interval [ - O, O ]. The difficulty of this problem is linked to the superresolution factor SRF, equal to the ratio of the Rayleigh length (inverse of O) by the spacing of the grid supporting the sparse vector. In the presence of additive deterministic noise of norm s, we show upper and lower bounds on the minimax error rate that both scale like (S R F) - 2 k 1 s, providing a partial answer to a question posed by Donoho in 1992. The scaling arises from comparing the noise level to a restricted isometry constant at sparsity 2 k, or equivalently from comparing 2 k to the so-called s -spark of the Fourier system. The proof involves new bounds on the singular values of restricted Fourier matrices, obtained in part from old techniques in complex analysis.
