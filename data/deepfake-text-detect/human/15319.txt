The Edgewater's rooms are really lovely. The room I stayed in was overly spacious, with a deliciously comfortable bed, and a really nice view of the lake. As a lot of people have mentioned the main areas (lobby, meeting rooms, etc.) are also quite well-appointed and it's clear that they put a lot of love into the remodel of this hotel. For the location and amenities the price can't be beat and I would definitely be happy to stay here again!
