The idea of countries bound by music was admirable, but flawed. When the majorities had to band together to prevent misuse of magic, those on the outside were tossed aside. When the pop empire, with its repetitive, yet hypnotic beats, came, the lone wolves stood no chance. Minimalist noise has power, but with no lyrics, it couldn't be performed on the fly to save its practitioners. The anime theme fans were put down easily when it was discovered most of them didn't understand the words to sing them. But the power of music and community could never be underestimated. Rebellions were quick to rise. Pagan folk musicians left for the forests to begin a new life. Speedcore and gabber groups teamed up in the Netherlands, their lightning-fast attacks gaining ground. Germany was a constant battleground, the NDH practitioners continually bolstering their ranks with fans from across the globe to fight an intensely fervent industrial and EBM underground all over Europe. Politically-charged groups took to the field. Separated by language but united in belief, white supremacist RAC and NSBM clans formed small but tight-knit groups chanting spells that horrified all those who heard them. Leftist groups were much larger, but more divided, and when one's magic was charged by personal belief, it was a battle neither side could truly win. Pubs, bars and community areas were quick to keep entertainment consistently coming to ward off attacks. A capella groups, harmonisers and barbershop bands had a surge in power and popularity. Their voices were the music, nothing else, making performance on the fly easy and surprise attacks impossible. In the end, nothing could be done. To ban music outright was foolhardy, and modern life was destroyed by the constant battle. Yet, in remote villages high in the mountains, on the vast savannahs and steppes across the world, life went on as it always had, the tranquillity broken only by the traditional songs they had sung for thousands of years.
