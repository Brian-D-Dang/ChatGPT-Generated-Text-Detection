Where the casino is dark, with low ceilings and could stand an update, the D Grill is a very nice oasis. With kind of a fifties diner decor and menu, the D Grill served some good food. We came to the D to play the quarter horse race game and stopped at the D Grill for lunch. We wound up having breakfast instead. I had the Cowboy, which is country fried steak with with gravy along with two eggs and Texas toast. The toast is served under the steak, but I would prefer to have it on the side. Wife had two eggs with ham and toast. Along with the toast they provide homemade strawberry preserves which are awesome. Service was good and the food was good as well.
