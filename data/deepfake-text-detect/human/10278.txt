First Let me just say I am 16 and don't have much experience with how it is in the'adult world'. But I don't think a 100 platonic relationship can exist between a straight male and a straight female. Can you think back to any friendship and say with absolute certainty that there was never even a hint of attraction? And even if you can, how do you know they don't or never haven't felt that way? It doesn't even need to be acted on to affect the relationship. It often with subconsciously. From my personal experience, this sort of friendship doesn't exist. So, change my view, Reddit!
