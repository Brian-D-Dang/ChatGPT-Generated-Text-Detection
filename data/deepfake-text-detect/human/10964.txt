No bull should be trusted. Whether playful or aggressive, any large animal that you turn your back on is immediately a danger because there is little you can do if they decide to get physical.','Bulls are aggressive and very protective of their herds. Compare a bull vs a steer (castrated at a young age); the steer is pretty quiet but the bull is aggressive. That aggression is thanks to the testosterone in their bodies from their testicles. The testosterone also causes more muscle mass. So, big (1800lb) and mean equals very dangerous for you to be around. This applies to dairy and beef bulls.
