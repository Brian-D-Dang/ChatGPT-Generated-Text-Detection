To quote a febreze commercial: "you go nose blind" Basically once you smell something for awhile, your brain decides. meh this smell isnt important anymore so we will just ignore it. (The same reason why you dont notice your house's smell until you are away from it for awhile) They just smell it too much for their brain to forget about it.', "The body forgets about constant stimulation of the senses, most noticeable in smell. When you walk into a restaurant, you smell all the food, but, by the time you leave, you barely notice it. This is to stop over-stimulation of the senses, and make sure you can focus on out of the ordinary things. Since they smoke, they are used to the smell, and since you don't stay long enough for your mind to de-register the smell, you can smell it.," "Smokers just become accustomed to the smell like anyone becomes accustomed to any smell they're around enough. People with bad body odour don't usually know it, likewise people may not notice their home smells like their pet, or the food they cook. When I was a smoker I never noticed, but soon after I quit I noticed how bad it smelled.,They got the smell stuck in their nose and mouth. So they are smelling smoke all the time. A bit of extra smoke does not make any difference to them. It is same with alcohol or garlic - you cannot smell it once you consumed it.', "When you smoke cigarettes, I don't know exactly why, but it clogs your sinuses or something and you just can't smell anything.
