OSMOSIS BABY! Essentially, the way cells work is that water is allowed to leak in and out. Water will diffuse in and out of a cell (or any other permeable membrane) towards the side of highest salt concentration. Thus when you increase the salt concentration outside the cell, the water in those cells diffuses out. Performed en masse, you get the leaking that happens when you salt an eggplant or tomatoes or whatever the heck you're salting.
