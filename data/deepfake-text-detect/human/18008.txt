So, a friend of mine was talking about how he thought it would be a good idea to start a religion. Many boring min's later, he goes "and everyone could take Mondays off because that would be our day of worship." and it sparked this idea in my head that, you shouldn't be excused from school or work because of religion. it is a choice to be religious and it should not be something that gets you out of your daily duty's. Now, I left the catholic church because I didnt beleive and it all seemed like a sham to me (im not trying to insult anyone, its just my view). Am I just being insensitive? (sorry if its god awful spellinggrammar, im on a smartphone)
