It is pretty well known that the colombine shooters believed in natural selection, a key point of evolution. Just from their [wiki] they talk about natural selection in their journals, Eric Harris wore a shirt with the words "natural selection" written on it. It is clear that they believed strongly in this idea. The thug who shot up the church in SC believed strongly in white supremacy, he believed in racism and the confederate flag. I think that artificial selection was used as a justification for such crimes like eugenics, the holocaust ect. Believing that the weak die off is one of Darwins core concepts (Survival of the fittest, the most adapted live, the least adapted die). I think it is much more vile than the confederate flag, (which also used artificial selection, breeding slaves to fill labor shortages was most likely [a thing] and breeding artificially is a form of artificial selection. Please, CMV. I feel a tad silly about even holding it, as I know there are differences but I just can't think of any. Edit: Why are we listening to the motives of one shooter over another, that is another key point in my view I forgot to add. EDIT 2: View more or less changed, as changed as I believe it could be.
