I've recently gotten into counting calories for the sake of not ending up overweight like most of the women in my family. (I'm actually pretty skinny, just being careful.) Due to this, I've been paying more attention to the amount of calories in foods I eat, and I've discovered something slightly horrifying. The majority of food available in my school, especially the main entrees, sides, and junk foods like cookies and ice cream, don't have calorie listed anywhere. This is bad for a couple of reasons. It makes keeping an eye on my health harder, it can cause teenagers not to have a good idea of how to eat healthy later in life, and screw up anyone who wants to lose weight. The only reason i can think of for not listing calories is that it could possibly enable people with eating disorders, but I'd argue that it would just freak them out. Well, there you have it. For the sake of my sanity, please change my view. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
