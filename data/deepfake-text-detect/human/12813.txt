"Okay Guys and Gals, let's get to work and burn those miserable fools lives into the ground. And if you need anything don't be afraid to approach me" Yelled Jim enthusiastically, the new leader of Googles Blackmail and Extortion Department the other one had moved onto'better' things. The twenty-three workers gave out a little cheer and reported to their desk to begin their days' work. Jim launched himself into his desk at the back of the department it had screens displaying hidden cameras so he could track his underlings and a file with today's orders leaning on his new stapler. "Well, who are we destroying today..." Jim said to no one in particular opening the file using his lightsaber mail opener. "Oh yes, this should be fun" as Jim read the file. Jim strolled away from his desk and in a joking tone said "Ten Hut" his new team looked at him without the judgmental gaze that his previous team had given him. Jim thought to himself'I don't think they know I fucked a goat. Good'. "Okay, guys today we ruin Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon. First, we will upload their search histories to Reddit as a'leak' by some hacker group I don't care which one. Then someone photoshop them onto nudes or find real ones if possible. Lastly, arrange for child pornography to be hidden in their search history so that the masses will think they are monsters. And if we have time someone get Rick and Morty Season 3 from their servers, seriously I can't be the only one desperate for it." Jim went back to his office and sat down as his team at the Blackmail and Extortion Department got to work ruining Justin and Tan. Jim didn't know why but he didn't ask questions he had heard his predecessor had done that and well he knows where that got him.
