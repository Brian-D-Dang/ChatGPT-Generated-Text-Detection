Kant believed that human life had value because humans have the unique ability to give value to other things by making value judgements about them. But by this definition, any living life that prefers food to starvation is giving value to food, and thus has intrinsic value. But do we act this way? Do we treasure a snail's life to the same degree that we treasure a human's? But is the act of preferring food to starvation, exciting things to dull things, beautiful things to plain things really the result of a sophisticated, unique life that thus has intrinsic value, or are those value judgements only the result of simply biological preferences created via millions of years of unintelligent evolution? Modern biology and psychology would argue the latter. Additionally, you could argue that life does not have intrinsic value but potential value. For example, maybe the value in life is that a person may use their life to discover a cure to a disease and save a million lives. But the problem is, if these millions of lives have no intrinsic value in themselves, then there is no glory in saving them. Thus life can have no potential value if it does not have intrinsic value.
