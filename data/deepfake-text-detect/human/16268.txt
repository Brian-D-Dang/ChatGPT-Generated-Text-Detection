Among the few bright spots during this season were the midseason crime dramedy Castle as well as the success of two family sitcoms that anchored the network's revamped Wednesday comedy lineup, The Middle and Modern Family, the latter of which was both a critical and commercial success. Shark Tank (based on the Dragon's Den reality format) also became a midseason sleeper hit on Sundays in the spring of 2010; the following season, it became the tentpole of the network's Friday night schedule, gradually helping make ABC a strong competitor (after being paired with 2020 and beginning with the 2012-13 season, the Tim Allen sitcom Last Man Standing) against CBS' long-dominant dramareality lineup on that night for the first time since the "TGIF" lineup ended in 2000.
