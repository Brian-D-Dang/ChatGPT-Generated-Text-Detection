Imagine you are cooking a pizza and you need the dough, some sauce, and some cheese and they are all located at in different places in a very big kitchen. You could either have Usain Bolt run to each of the places and grab them for you (spinning disk drive) or you could have Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, and Aaron Rodgers standing next to each of them and they throw them to you at the same time (solid state). Usain Bolt is fast but not that fast.', "Harddrives have to spin to find the correct part of the magnetic disk where the information is stored. SSD's dont.,Inside a hard drive there is a read -head. Kind of like the arm on a record player. So, if you want to read a file, and it is on the outside of the disk, and the head is currently near the middle of the disk, then you have to wait while the hard drive controller moves the head from one place to another. Additionally, the file may be split up into pieces and strewn about the disk. This slows access down, too, as you have to wait for the head to shift. This is called fragmentation, and there are programs that undo this, such as "ultra defrag." And finally, you have multiple programs all trying to read and write at the same time, so the read head has to bounce back and forth between the files. SSD drive works more like computer memory, it's directly addressable, so there is no delay when reading and writing for a "head" to move.
