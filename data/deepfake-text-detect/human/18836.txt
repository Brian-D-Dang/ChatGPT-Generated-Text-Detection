This is my oldest son, who had language delay as his early symptom. He also had some stereotyped behaviors and decreased eye contact at 18 months. These are all symptoms on the autism spectrum, so he got lumped in with the DSM-IV diagnosis Pervasive Developmental Delay - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). PDD-NOS is the "trash can" diagnosis where all autism spectrum diagnoses that didn't fit classical or Asperger's were placed. (Yes, DSM-V is out, however, it isn't being used clinically yet for Autism diagnoses, at least here). Lots of kids get placed in the PDD-NOS category, as it gets them social services that will help with developmental delays, regardless of their cause. ABA (Advanced Behavioral something...) is actually pretty awesome, and I feel like it would benefit every kid, regardless of delay or diagnosis. So now my son is 4. He smiles, gives me huge hugs, is wicked smart, talks a mile a minute and won't stop moving until he is exhausted and falls asleep. He'll say hi to people, he will initiate play with others his age and sitters, and he is actually more social than I am. He was recently re-evaluated, and the evaluation boiled down to he exhibits behaviors compatible with his previous diagnosis. The only specific behaviors were decreased eye-contact and anxiety telling a story. I think if you took 4 year old me and ran a diagnostic panel, I'd be labeled as Autistic too. So - to the point, I feel like my Autism, specifically PDD-NOS is being used as a screening tool, designed to catch kids with developmental delays where early intervention can be helpful. This is leading to massive over-diagnosis, and pressure on providers to diagnose kids so they qualify for services. Doing things in this way is detrimental, as there is a large emotional morbidity that goes un-discussed with having a child 'labeled' with a broad diagnosis that has a wide range of outcomes. CMV.
