To go along side the WTC 911 post. To date: 1) the "magic bullet" theory has been proven possible by multiple independent testers. Its not only possible, but recreatable. 2) Firing that amount of shots with that rifle is not only possible, but easy, especially for a trained marskman like Oswald. 3) To date, there has been 0 evidence for any other shooters. No shell casings. No recovered bullets. No pictures of a gunman. No reliable witnesses of more than one shooter. Nothing. 4) LHO killed a cop later that day. No one seems to ever bring that up. He killed him with a pistol he had ordered through the mail. Ballistics matches the gun. You don't kill a police officer on a whim. 5) "Back and Away" - A head is going to react like that when shot from behind (as in consistent with the lone gunman theory) There is nothing I love more than a good conspiracy theory, but there is absolutely no evidence suggesting more than one shooter, only a shitload of suspiciousfishy shit that went down.
