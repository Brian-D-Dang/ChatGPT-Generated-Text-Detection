Woohoo! Best Cirque show I've been to yet! Some might say I am biased because I have this love for Beatles music, but I think that the content of the show and the theatrics were very exciting from beginning to end. I was sitting on the second to the top tier as we had discounted locals tix and the view was still great. Granted, I would've liked to sit a little closer (for reasons that I will not disclose because there is a certain part of the show that gets the people up front involved) but watching from up top was still awesome. The music timed up with the theatrics was a real treat as well because it's 1) obviously the Beatles and 2) the mixing of the songs were seamless and flowed very nicely. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was my pricey beer. But, hey, it's the Mirage so what do you expect? Definitely a treat and I would highly recommend!
