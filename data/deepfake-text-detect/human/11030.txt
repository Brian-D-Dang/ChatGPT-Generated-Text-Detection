Entrapment is when the police caused you to commit a crime and you wouldn't have committed it otherwise. Paraphrased from somewhere in [The Illustrated Guide to Law] (URL0),Entrapment is when the law enforcer aggressively coerces the perp into doing something illegal, and then arrests them for doing so. E.g. a cop covering as a prostitute repeatedly orders a person to use their "services" until they agree. Then the cop arrests the person for something they were almost forced to do. Stings of the kind you described are not forcing things like CP onto people, but rather bringing the perpetrators out of hiding.','For those cases where the stings are setup, the perp has already committed the crime and given reasonable suspicion by showing up for the encounter', "They're not convinced to commit pedophilia, that's something they already intended to do. They're just caught falling for false bait.
