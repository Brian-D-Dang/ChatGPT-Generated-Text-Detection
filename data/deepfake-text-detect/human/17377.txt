I say this as someone who has spent much of her adult life doing this for myself. Sometimes it has been easy (dissociating a song that was a hit at the time of my last suicide attempt from that period), sometimes it has been very hard (dealing with reminders of my ex after she abandoned me), sometimes I still haven't completely succeeded (my fear of office-type workplaces in conjunction with the job I was working that caused the aforementioned suicide attempt, certain other reminders of my ex, being in a room with only men). But I think it shows an unbecoming weakness to not keep trying until you succeed to make it not bother you anymore. Edit: I've come around to think that the words "moral obligation" are definitely unfitting for how I feel about it but that it's definitely still important. Hello, users of CMV!
