A small floatplane lands in a bay on the Caribbean island of Joost Van Dyke island. The smallest of the British Virgin Islands was most famous for its pirate founder and sexy beach bars. Popular with island hoppers this quiet piece of heaven is about to be shook by the discovery of vast treasure. Stepping of the plane is Bruce Tellow or "The Looker" as you would know him if you watch late night infomercials. Believed to be a god by some and Scam artist by others in all actuality he was a mix of both. At the age of 19 after working with his uncle at a research facility young Bruce obtained the power to look into pictures. That's how he always told the story anyway. With any picture he sees Bruce can see what happened to the people in it up to 3 days before or after the picture was taken. This skill has made Bruce substantial wealth from various enterprises. The most recent being psychic phone chat lines that mostly use Philippineo men who sound just enough like him. His newest pursuit was buried treasure after stumbling across a children's book of treasure hunters. In the back was a small picture of the author. Bruce raced through the six days of the mans life he could see in about 12 minutes. His mind able to pick out important details as he skimmed over the rest like a mind reader. Roughly two days after the authors picture was taken he had stumbled upon the location of Joost treasure before dying of a heart attack. Now it was Bruce's time to shine. With GPS and guide in hand he made his way to the coordinates the author had narrowed down. Getting close Bruce began to shake and sweat. As he pushed through the bushes he stumbled out into a nicely paved street. Across from him stood The Buried Treasure tiki bar. On a bronze plate mounted on the door was inscribed "in this spot 1996 local residents discovered a buried gold treasure worth an estimated two million dollars"
