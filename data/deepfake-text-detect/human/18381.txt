Lately I've been hearing a lot about how you can get shadowbanned if you follow a link to a NP subreddit, and vote on comments that you see there. I just don't believe that this is true. If you don't know, NP links are used in subreddits like rSubredditDrama or rbestof to link to a comment thread, with the intention that you will not participate in the discussion there. So instead of linking to something like: you are linked to something like: The goal is to give the referring subreddits plausible deniability to the charge that they are "brigading" the post that they are linking to. And the myth is that if you follow an NP link and voteparticipate the Reddit admins will detect it and ban you. I don't believe it. The whole rNoParticipation scheme is entirely user created. They have their own rules that they display on their own subreddit, but they are not reddit admins and they cannot ban anyone from any other subreddit. My opinion is that the Reddit admins tolerate the NP scheme, but they do not enforce it. In fact they have actually spoken out against it on occasion where they felt that it broke the [5th Rule of Reddit] : "Don't break the site or do anything that interferes with normal use of the site." I do believe that you can get banned for actual brigading, but simply participating in an NP thread does not constitute brigading.
