This was triggered by [an article on news.com.au] about an airline traveller who found his luggage on the carousel with "I AM GAY" written on it in stickers. The traveller [tweeted the incident with a photo] , calling it disgusting, and lots of people chimed in, using terms like "disgusting," "unforgivable," "disgraceful," "abhorrent behaviour" and so on. I expect that if the baggage handler in question had written "I'm an aborigine" or "I am a black person" on the luggage, the owner would have probably just shrugged, gone "no, I'm not actually" and nobody would have made much of a fuss about it. The fact that everyone is getting their knickers in a twist about it tells me that the commenters in question are latently homophobic. It's only an "unforgivable slur" if you think being gay is a detestable thing. I expect that there may be a different explanation for all the outrage, but I can't think what it is. To me it all seems like closet homophobia in all those oh-so-enlightened and tolerant commenters.
