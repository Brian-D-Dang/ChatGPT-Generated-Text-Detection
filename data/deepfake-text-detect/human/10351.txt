I recently got in an argument with a friend regarding the BLM (Black Lives Matter) interruption of Bernie Sanders speech. I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still hold its unacceptable to break the law the way BLM did. My friend argued back that since both of us are white, we can never understand the situation and the anger these representatives of BLM feel. Therefore, she argued, we cannot criticize their actions since we cannot and can never understand their perspective. My friend showed me [this article] in defense of her argument. I'll quote from the conclusion, Instead of tearing down other human beings who are acting upon decades of pent-up anger at a system decidedly against them, a system that has told them they are less than human for years, we ought to be reaching out to help them regain the humanity they lost, not when a few set fire to the buildings in Ferguson, but when they were born the wrong color in the post-racial America. In response to the article, I essentially argued that while I do feel for minorities in the U.S, violence is neither a morally sound or pragmatic way to go about change. I also felt that the argument presented (we are not minorities, therefore we will never be able to understand, therefore we cannot criticize) is fundamentally unsound. I'd love to hear some support for her viewpoint, because I am an open-minded person and I care about racial equality America So please, CMV! Hello, users of CMV!
