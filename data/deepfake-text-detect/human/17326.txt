We I walk down the street and see a really ugly person, I automatically assume that they are probably less intelligent than a plain person. I believe this because there appears to be a positive correlation between beauty and socio-economic status. There also appears to be a positive correlation between intelligence and socio-economic status. People who are more intelligent, are more likely to be able to find time to exercise, leading to increased physical attractiveness, compounding the issue. As such, when I see a really fugly person, I assume that they can barely afford to eat, and I correlate the reason for this as being unintelligent.
