This paper presents an adaptive randomized algorithm for computing the butterfly factorization of a x m n matrix with m n provided that both the matrix and its transpose can be rapidly applied to arbitrary vectors. The resulting factorization is composed of O (log n) sparse factors, each containing O (n) nonzero entries. The factorization can be attained using O (n 3 2 log n) computation and O (n log n) memory resources. The proposed algorithm applies to matrices with strong and weak admissibility conditions arising from surface integral equation solvers with a rigorous error bound, and is implemented in parallel.
