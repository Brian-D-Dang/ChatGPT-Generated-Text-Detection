Before I begin I would just like to state that I am not proposing that we devalue mathematical understanding in any way, instead we should refocus it away from the part we spend most of our time on now (computation), because computers can do this without error. HOWEVER, I am not proposing that we drop this altogether. We should still learn computation, but it is more important to understand how to convert real world issues into mathematical equations, correctly apply mathematical techniques, and convert the answer back into a real world property. Ask me for more details if you think this devalues math, lowers understanding, or anything else of the sort. Edit: Thanks you so much for all the comments and feedback. I really appreciate it. Edit 2: So I just found [this ted talk] and it explains everything I am arguing for. Please watch it. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
