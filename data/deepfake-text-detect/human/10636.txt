I don't think they quite fill the same role. The biggest appeal of zombies is that they are a faceless, humanoid foe that we can imagine performing all manner of violent acts on without any guilt. This role has been filled by many different things over the years. It used to be Native Americans, then it was German soldiers, and recently it's terrorists. People love to be violent, but don't like the guilt. As we come to realize that people with different beliefs are still people, we need to phase out the current faceless bad guy and replace him. Zombies, however, are timeless. Nobody advocates for the rights of the walking dead.,that actually is kinda of an interesting theory. if superheroes are the modern version of the ancient gods, it stands to reason that zombies are the modern dragons. with the way we see them as being an actual threat despite being completely fictional
