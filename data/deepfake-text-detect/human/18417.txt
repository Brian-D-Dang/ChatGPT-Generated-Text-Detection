I was having this discussion last night with a couple of friends. What got it started was one of my friends knows an Indian girl who married someone to come and live in the UK and another friend took exception to that as immoral as it wasn't a marriage based on the western norm of romantic love. This was something I completely disagreed with because he was just looking at it through his own cultural bias and if two consenting adults want to get married for whatever reason they should be able to. This then evolved into a discussion on the nature of morality and if there are universal moral rights or wrongs - the way I see it there is no such thing. The concept of morality is something that is heavily dependant on the culture you grew up in and the situation you are in. The closest things I can think of to universal moral norms across all cultures are not to rape or murder - however even that isn't necessarily set in stone. I'm sure if you asked 100 people if murder is rightwrong you'd get them all saying unequivocally it's wrong. However if you asked those same people if it would be justifiable to murder Hitler pre-WW2 the majority would say yes. The way I see it even with the most universally accepted moral norms there is still a grey area where in certain situations it can be just as moral to break those accepted norms. Admittedly we are talking hypothetical situations, but morality as a human construct is adaptable to the situation you are in rather than a universal right and wrong. Please do try and change my view though.
