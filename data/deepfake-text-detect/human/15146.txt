Had the absolute worst service here today. Straight from the Amy's Baking Co handbook. As a former regular we will never go back. Our entire table was flabbergasted at the treatment we received, it was embarrassing. There are plenty of decent breakfast places with great service in the area that will gladly get our business in the future. Not this place!
