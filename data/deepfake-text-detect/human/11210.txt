Recurrent Neural Networks are a type of neural network that specializes in processing sequences. A common application of RNNs is for Natural Language Processing due to its effectiveness at handling text. RNNs are able to have variable-length sequences as both inputs and outputs, which sets them apart from other fixed-size type networks. The ability to process sequences makes RNNs very useful, for example, in Machine Translation and Sentiment Analysis. This guide builds an RNN to train it to determine whether a given text string is positive or negative.
