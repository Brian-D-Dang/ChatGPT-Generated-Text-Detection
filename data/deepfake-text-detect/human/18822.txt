We will be here and gone and the universe will forget us. At the minute, I just can't see us making a impact on the universe. On the huge timescale of the universe we will be a spec of dust that will disappear without any trace, then the universe will end. What's the point in it all? (No theist bullshit, I won't be convinced by that at all) Edit: I also think I'll die believing the human race won't do anything truly amazing before the inventible extinction of our species. Examples, interstellar travel, meeting another sentient species, exploring the extreme vastness the universe, knowing the answer to important questions for absolute certainty like whats outside the universe and how it began. I'd like to change my view on this because I'd hate to see our species die with nothing to show for it
