I think the newer films were great if not greater than the original films because of the actors and technology that they had at their disposal really was able to bring the true nature of the films and tell a better story than the originals. The acting was much better too. Not only from Liam Neeson or Ewen McGregor but from the whole cast, especially the voice acting for Jar Jar Binks i felt brought a whole other level of realism and lifelike of the other aliens within Star Wars.
