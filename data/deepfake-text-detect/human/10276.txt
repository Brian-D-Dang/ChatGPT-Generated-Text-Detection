I have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy. Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically many more people are killed by other forms of energy generation (I believe!). That's not to say that this isn't a worry, on some level. It's just not my top worry. I am, however, concerned about nuclear waste. The goal of developing alternative energies, to my mind, is to reduce our environmental footprint and save our ecosystem as we know it. Sure, we might slow global warming using nuclear energy - but to my knowledge, we don't really have any good way of dealing with nuclear waste. Investing in nuclear energy is just a way of trading one environmental problem for another. Second, other forms of renewable energy are increasingly cost-effective and efficient. There's no reason to be generating nuclear power when we can do just as well with other forms of energy. Third, nuclear energy is an international conundrum. If we could move away from nuclear energy in the United States and invest globally in other forms of renewable resources, we would be able to prove, in some small way, that nuclear energy programs are unnecessary - and, therefore, give us more leverage to refuse to tolerate them in diplomatic talks.
