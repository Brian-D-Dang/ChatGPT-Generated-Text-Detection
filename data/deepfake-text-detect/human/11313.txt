A Tesla Model S owner is suing the company because his Tesla crashed into a Ford Fiesta in the next lane "suddenly, and without any warning" at 80mph when he was using the Autopilot feature on October 12th. A Tesla spokesperson said "It is the driver's responsibility to remain attentive to their surroundings and in control of the vehicle at all times," but Tesla's Autopilot home page has a big banner at the top that says "full self-driving hardware on all cars." Hudson says that a Tesla sales rep said he only needed to "occasionally place his hand on the steering wheel and that the vehicle would do everything else." He is suing Tesla for selling a defective product and deceptive marketing.
