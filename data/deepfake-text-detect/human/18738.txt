EDIT 2: I went to bed and stopped replying, but I'm back now. Sorry about that. Ever since the rise of television, the argument over wether media depicting violence increases violent crime and aggressive attitudes has been incessantly debated. After television, it has been video games' turn in the scope, with stories such as [petition to remove GTAV from target in Australia] , or [Anita Sarkeesian's criticism on how games promote violence towards women] . EDIT: Anita Sarkeesian doesn't say games promote violence, but rather that they desensitize gamers to it. That's poor wording on my part. Thanks uKelsig for pointing that out. I simply don't buy it. There have been few academic studies that actually have a decent sample size (at the very least 100 people), and those that do are either [inconclusive] or show [no real correlation] between violence and violent video games. I have a very big problem with the idea that violent videogames translate to violent crime: where is that data? The FBI reports a steady decrease of violent crime from [2009-2013] and wikipedia shows similar results on a higher scale, with a general decrease [all the way from the early 1990's] . The UK shows positive results as well, with the guardian reporting that violent crime [decreased by 68 from 1995] and similar results are shown [by the ONS] . I'm pretty sure most western countries show similar violent crime rates. The disparity here is with how much time people actually spend on games. About 5 ago, COD kills [surpassed the population of the Earth] , and it's not rare that devoted players reach [hundreds of thousands of kills in 5 or 6 years] . To me, there is simply no way a significant correlation between these two sets of data exist, and I think any statistician would agree. I do have one more issue I want to address, however: people choose games based on their predispositions, and not the other way around. People who really like football choose FIFA, because of that, and people who find FPSs enjoyable buy these games and spend hundreds of hours on them. I don't find it weird that if you like something, you spend a lot of time on it. It just doesn't add up. So, rchangemyview, do what you're good at:) Hello, users of CMV!
