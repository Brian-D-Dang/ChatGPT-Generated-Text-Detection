It seems like the only thing you can do with a philosophy degree is teach philosophy or write philosophy textbooks. It's a self-contained educational ecosystem where teachers teach because they have to make a living, and thus rear more students who can only use their degrees to teach more students, etc. Another problem is that philosophy is interesting as hell, so it's a trap for undergrads who think they're only at college to learn because learning is awesome, and while I agree, how exactly do they plan on paying off their debts. I can get on board with a philosophy minor, or a retired guy going back to school and getting a philosophy degree because learning is fun and philosophy is cool, but seeing 20-year-olds 2 years into a philosophy degree and deluding themselves into thinking they can do anything useful with it just makes me cringe.
