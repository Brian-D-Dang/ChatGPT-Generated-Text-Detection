For the time that I've been alive I have only seen terrible things about socialism, how its "unamerican" and, with the help of communism, will seek to destroy the beautiful capitalist system. While I see nothing wrong with capitalism, as it is a great system that promotes self betterment, I have started to see that it is not such a bad idea. When I've gone to express this in debates with friends I was felt like looked down upon like I was a three headed mutant who expressed his love for killing puppies. Maybe my way of thinking is bad, maybe I'm tired of the anti-socialistcommunist propoganda, or maybe I kinda like the ideas of the socialist agenda, but I would like someone to change my view.
