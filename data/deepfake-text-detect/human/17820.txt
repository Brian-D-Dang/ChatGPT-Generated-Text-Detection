First, there's the issue of an unromantic wedding night. Neither of them know what they are doing, the girl will be in pain, and the guy will be lucky to last longer than 10 seconds. Why not get the awkwardness out of the way earlier? The main issue is sexual incompatibility. If a couple has never sexually experimented with each other or another couple, they may be stuck in a boring, sexless marriage because they are incompatible and didn't realize it sooner. Upholding a personal or religious conviction is not worth risking such big relationship issues. I think couples should have lots of premarital sex experience, and perhaps have a few other partners before settling down.
