Overall good experience. Loved the garlic tapenade and bread, paired with a 2009 Louis Martini Cab. Caesar salad was ok, a little watery instead of pasty bold flavor, fixed with a little extra dressing. I ordered the Rib Eye Special, the husband ordered Pasta with sausage, neither were memorable. Our friends enjoyed the Chilean Sea Bass and Lasagna Our waiter Glenn was good and accommodating. We didn't care for Francisco the asst. waiter, limited English and not helpful.
