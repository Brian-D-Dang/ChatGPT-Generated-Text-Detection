Ahrefs, a company that crawls more than 8 billion web pages every 24 hours for its SEO toolset, has invested 60 million into building its own search engine called Yep. The engine will rely on the company's own search index and run on its own data centers. It already has more than 1,000 servers spun up storing more than 100 petabytes of data. The company plans to give 90 of its ad revenue to content creators. The search engine will be heavily privacy-forward and it won't create profiles for targeted advertising.
