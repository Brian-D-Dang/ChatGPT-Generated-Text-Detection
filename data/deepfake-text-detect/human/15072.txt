Bright, huge, friendly, cheap! I have to admit I have a bias because any bar with a ping-pong table in it would have to work hard not to get 5 stars from me but it's easily 4 stars without the table. The food I've had is good and it's a very bright and cheery place. 2.75 for that pint of PBR, and I'd say at least 25 60 plasma screens. Also they do UFC parties and Texas Hold'Em on Sat. nights. Loved it and will keep goin back...
