How do you store something like plutonium, which has a half-life in the millions of years and is toxic at micro levels? Why are most nuclear power plants still storing all their spent fuel on-site? I don't believe it can safely be stored anywhere. Nobody wants a hot mess of radionuclides anywhere near them. Who will take ownership of it for 100k years? The effects of Chernobyl were devastating. And that was in a sparsely-populated area. Situations like Fukushima Daiichi, which involve far more nuclear fuel, including fuel with concentrated plutonium (MOX), in a far more densely populated environment (40x Chernobyl) are concerning, and I don't think NP is sustainable.
