This is a common assumption in todays society and I can't think of any reason why it is right other than the fact that I can't think of any reason it's wrong, so why not? In other words, unless there are good reasons that mutually consenting adults shouldn't engage in an act, then there is no reason why we should voluntarily prohibit ourselves from engaging in such actions. The second part is that since there are no good reasons for us to inhibit our number of sex partners, therefore a person who negatively judges any individual (even silently) is wrong in their judgement. Remember, this is all based on assumption that the person is engaging in safe sex. So, can anyone change my view that people should (1) have as many sex partners as they want, even if its over 1000, as long as they practice safe sex and (2) no one should ever be judged for how many partners they've had?
