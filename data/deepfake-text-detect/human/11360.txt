The Planetary Society, an organization founded by Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis Friedman, is sending a small spacecraft to orbit the planet. Known as the LightSail 2, the satellite builds on the success and learnings from the LightSail 1, which was launched in 2015. Carl Sagan had envisioned a spacecraft that could be entirely powered through solar energy. After a few days in orbit, the LightSail 2 will unfurl its sails and start receiving soft pushes from the sun's rays. As the satellite will be in zero gravity, after 30 days, these small pushes will accumulate into a significant amount of momentum.
