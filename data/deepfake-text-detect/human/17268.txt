Currently, if this situation were to arise, the shooter would be awarded an assist. Say a defenseman takes a shot from the blueline, and it glances off the shin guard of the center in front of the net, the center would be awarded the goal despite whether or not he made an attempt to redirect the puck. I think goals should only be awarded to those that make a deliberate attempt to move the puck towards the net. I doesn't really matter, since assissts and goals are both worth a point in their stat line, but saying someone is a 30 goal scorer, as opposed to a 20 goal scorer, holds considerable weight in contract negotiations. edit: Sorry for not responding for so long. Some great responses in here, and it certainly C'dMV. I underestimated the amount of skill that goes into the art of deflecting, and that even those slight glances may in fact be intentional.
