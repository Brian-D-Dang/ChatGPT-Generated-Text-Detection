Twitter's board intends to enforce Elon Musk's merger agreement. Musk had agreed to a transaction at 54.20 per share, but put the deal on hold pending proof that less than 5 of users on the platform are bots or spam accounts. He claims that his offer was based on Twitter's SEC filings being accurate. Musk has a contractual obligation to buy Twitter at the agreed price.
