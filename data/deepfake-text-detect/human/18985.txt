Prompted by the Redditors who never want kids, what's your reason? I posted this response: I think a better question is why would you WANT kids? All they do is grow from screaming shit machines into little assholes, and then into slightly bigger assholes. Everyone who has kids is constantly telling me how WONDERFUL it IS having kids, but the examples they give are always "you had to be there" things. It's like they're all in a cult and I don't get the dogma. In addition, the western world is overpopulated, we are rapidly running out of resources so to add to this burden is harmful to humanity. I believe that hormone driven empathy overrides the rational mind to make people want to procreate against their own, and everyone else's best interests. I also believe the stories of parents about how "wonderful" their children are, simply get created so they don't have to face up to the fact that they have made a life-altering mistake.
