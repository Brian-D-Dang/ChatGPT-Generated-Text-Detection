I have nothing against weed smoking. I have done it myself, my friends do it. I am Canadian and the debate has come up lately, particularly with one political party endorsing legalization. When I was 13-16 getting alcohol was far more difficult than getting marijuana. What I am worried is that if marijuana is difficult to get, highschoolers (the majority of which smoke marijuana or try it in highschool) will turn to something different which in my opinion is all worse (Cocaine, Crack Cocaine, Industrial Products, MDMA, etc). That is the only reason. I fully believe it has health benefits and it certainly is not harmful. So, change my view?
