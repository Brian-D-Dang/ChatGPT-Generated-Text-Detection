I believe that services run by the United States National Parks Service, as well as state, county, and city parks authorities are absolutely vital to our cultural well-being. Yet when governments begin to run into fiscal trouble one of the first services on the chopping block is Parks and Rec. This always bothered me as a child, and now as an adult working for a parks service that has had to partially privatize itself in order to stay operational I find it highly disturbing. People are having to pay more and more to come visit what by all rights should be their natural heritage. Forcing people who love to work in parks and nature preserves across the country to work part time seasonal positions with no benefits has driven away many good responsible caretakers because they couldn't afford to continue working with their passion. I'm aware that many may not exactly share my passion for the outdoors, or have even been to many parks in their lifetime. I'd highly recommend that you change that, go outside and visit our nation's parks. Even if you don't enjoy hiking the Appalachian Trail for a month, or can't survive for more than a couple of hours without flushing a toilet, getting outside and enjoying yourself someplace like a park has profound physiological and psychological benefits.
