Amazing curry, done Japanese style. Staff is very attentive, and all of the food cooked fresh to order. They do give you options on your spiciness level desired, I'm a wimp and do 1. My husband does a 7, and he loves the bracing kick it has. All of the fried foods are perfectly done, juicy when appropriate. The sauce is the best part of the meal, hearty and ultra flavorful. My fave place to eat in Vegas!
