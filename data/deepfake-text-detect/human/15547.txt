I have been a subscription customer of westfield comics since the late 80s, with a couple of hiatus (es) while in graduate school or moving around the country. Sadly, I am canceling my standing orders due to poor customer service and failure to answer my questions via email. Its a serious decision because now I'll either have to figure out which of the dwindling number of comic stores in my area will pull titles, or find another company online. I am giving them 2 stars because up until now, I had a great experience. Kind of feels like a betrayal after approximately 25 years, but I'm a big boy with a nice income to spend with a better company with better customer service.
