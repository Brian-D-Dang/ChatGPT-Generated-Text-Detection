I looked forward to this meal for months but was sadly dissapointed. I had the posole, the rough cut tuna, and the shrimp tamale. My wife had the chile relleno. We found the food to be fairly bland and not mediocre. The place was beautiful, the beer and service were great, but honestly, I came for a kick-ass meal and this place flopped in that department. Out of what we had I'd say the tuna was the best....
