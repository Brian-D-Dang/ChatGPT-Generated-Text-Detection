My family was all gathered around the casket. A heart attack took my old man. Herbert Robin Warren was legally dead before they got him on the stretcher, but he hadn't had much of a heart since before I can remember. The abusive monster was only sober 4 times between my being 6 and 22. My grams had begged me to speak about him, since no one else in my family even liked him enough to find something kind to say. "Five days ago my father's cold dead body was laying on the couch. Now my father's cold, dead body is laying in that box. He was never warm in his entire life. Not once."
