From wiki on linguistic relativity: The principle of linguistic relativity holds that the structure of a language affects the ways in which its respective speakers conceptualize their world. To me it seems like the common English speaking person doesn't know how to express themselves accurately. I feel like we don't really have many ways in which we can elaborate on ourselves to understand each others emotions, and that our limited representation of the large amount of emotions causes misinformation. I speak in general but my largest bias is against the word love. Love is a rich field of emotions that are all generalized into just a few words. I'm sure there's hundreds of words that I can't personally think of, but I've rarely met people that know more than 4 or 5 words to express what can be called love. And even if you all can list however many words you know that range from affection to lust to desire, do you ever use those words? Do you ever yearnromanceetc for you other (even if you act according to those words), or do you just love them? To be rude: I'd guess the uneducated have a harder time logically solving loves problems because of such submission to a single idea. I think I'm right though and would like to be wrong, because then it would seem like people aren't really that completely incompetent of observing a obvious problem. I try to be very expressive in my partnership, I think it does wonders for us emulating and mixing different types of love in extremity. It seems logical to me. But I could be missing a shit ton of perspective. CMV.
