Miscommunication is very, very easy because the hectic nature of an emergency room isolates people from one member of their health care team to the next, making communications between them essential. In reality, this sort of information should've been written in a big, black bold marker across his chart. In fact, 'sick man from Liberia' should've gotten him a ticket straight into an isolation room until he could be sorted out. Ebola man: "I'm feeling very nausea, I've got a fever, and severe abdominal pain." Nurse: semi-distracted because this is the thousandth tummy ache she's seen today as everyone in Texas uses the ER as their personal walk-in clinic thanks to high uninsured rates "Yeah, okay." writes those symptoms Ebola man: "Also, I just came from Liberia." Nurse: "I'll be sure to pass that along." doesn't write it down because she just wants to move onto the next of a hundred patients in line Mistakes happen, unfortunately, and communication-related ones tend to be the most frequent. Its a common byproduct of over-worked, under-staffed healthcare departments. The frequency they happen in a hospital setting can be unsettling at times (says the guy who works in an ER).', "Can you imagine how many uninsured people come to the ER with a stomach ache and fever? Texas has a major health care issue and the state government isn't helping much. Last week not every one was thinking ebola. This week they are.,I think the answer to this is fairly straightforwarda busy, overworked, overstressed RN forgot to chart this ultimately important detail. Abdominal pain is an extremely common complaint (in the ER where I worked it was something like 3 on the top reasons for visit). Because it is so common and many belly pains are handled with a usually standard series of tests to rule out most likely conditions, I imagine the nurse was not thinking Ebola and instead thinking this was just one of the probably dozens of abdominal pains heshe had treated that night.
