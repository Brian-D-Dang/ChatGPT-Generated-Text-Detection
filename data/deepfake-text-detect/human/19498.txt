Today I made some spaghetti and the sauce came in a [regular glass jar] like this.[Edit: Sometimes it even comes in [a more extreme jar, like this] , exacerbating the problem even more]. There was a ton of sauce stuck on the part that goes in and it was a pain to get out because knives don't bend like that and it's hard to shake it out without getting sauce everywhere. Anything that comes sold in a jar like that should be sold in a [wide-mouth mason jar] instead, they're objectively better in every way. Way easier to get anything out of them, just run a knife around it if it's stuck. It looks like it uses less glass Easier to clean for recycling Higher potential for reuse because they can be cleaned easier Easier to stack because the lid is the same size as the base, eliminating any balancing you would get with the other jar Hello, users of CMV!
