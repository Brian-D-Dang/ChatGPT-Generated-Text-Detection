When I was young, I was an alter girl. I was active in the Catholic church about 6 miles from my home and went there almost 3 days a week on average. However, as I turned 8 or 9 years old, I was sexually assaulted by a church member there repeatedly. I left the church and after a long time of debating the existence of God, 10 years later I decided I was an Atheist. I have only set foot in a church because of family events and have discovered I am extremely uncomfortable in one. I have to leave or sit in the bathroom. However, my boyfriend's family is Catholic. It's a long time until we even consider marriage but this is a thought that has crossed my mind. They go every Sunday. My boyfriend is Agnostic and heavily disagrees with the Catholic religion in the same way that I do. I think he would be married in a church to avoid waves with his family. I completely understand why they would like us to be married in a church because that is what they believe. But, my boyfriend doesn't believe, I don't believe, and I hate being in churches to the point of having to leave. I feel I shouldn't have to accommodate his side of the family in this particular situation. My extended family probably wouldn't care, we have had many weddings outside of churches. It's OUR day and neither of us want to be married in a church, so why should I be forced to do something that makes me morally and physically uncomfortable just to please them? His family doesn't know about my history with the church and I'd rather they never know. They do know, however know I am Atheist. And I can't care if that upsets them as horrible as that sounds. I really do care about them and want to make them happy, but I feel I can't in this situation. Maybe CMV? I'm willing to change my opinion if there are any good reasons to.
