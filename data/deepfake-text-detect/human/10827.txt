They aren't the ones who need it the least if you think about dirt. Cars with a trunk and a more angled rear window will see more rain hit the window, but cars with a flat rear end will see maximum air pressure pushing up dirtgrime into the back of the car. For this reason, these cars often have rear windshield wipers... for the dirt that is more likely to accumulate, etc... not necessarily for the rain.," "Aerodynamics can be counterintuitive. The flat vertical back of a hatchback or SUV creates turbulent air behind it that can then deposit dirt on the rear window. I drive a hatchback and it's true I tend to just use the rear wiper for one or two wipes, but that's one or two more than zero!
