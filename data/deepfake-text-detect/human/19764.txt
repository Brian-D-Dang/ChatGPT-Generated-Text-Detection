The NZ govt owns a number of assets including but not limited to several power stations and a cross country rail system. I am of the opinion that a 49 sale of NZ assets is not a smart move. It would seem to open up part ownership by foreign investors which without wanting to sound xenophobic is not in NZ's best interest. We the individual paying for our power would have that money going overseas instead of back into New Zealand's economy. So the long and short is that to my way of thinking asset sales might leave us with a short term economic boost cash" from the initial sale) but ultimately a portion our money will end up in the hands of people who don't live in NZ and may not have the country's best interests at heart. (I am not suggesting that only foreign investors would wish this country ill there are plenty of NZers who would probably see this country down the drain as well)
