I believe they are cock blocking us from getting high paying jobs and opportunities. I am a 26 year old male, I graduated a couple years ago with a B.Sc and a B.Ed. It has been my understanding that in order for one to obtain a permanent teaching positionor even a term positionone must go through the front door, that is substitute teaching. Unfortunately, what I noticed was that many young teachers were not being added to the substitute list. I have noticed an alarming trend for schools to give preference to retired teachers andor senior citizens who had better 'connections.' On frequent occasions I have observed these retired teachers sleeping in their desks and going through the motions. What I find particularly disturbing is how they can 'work' and still receive pension on the side. They are essentially double dipping, while the younger generations have to settle for minimum wage jobs, serving coffee, flipping burgers, etc. It's no coincidence that you have young individuals, with degrees of various kinds in almost every discipline, working at Starbucks or Subway, because these silver haired relics are giving preferential treatment to people within their age bracket. When we level criticism to their practices, they toss around words like 'entitled,' 'spoiled brats,' 'ungrateful,' 'over-privilegedbut I won't stand for it. Many of us have worked minimum wage for yearsthrough high school and university. Many graduates are deep in the red with all kinds of debt. There are many who are pushing 30 and still living with their parents (thankfully, not myself.) The more they keep us away from specialized jobs and the more they keep us away from opportunities, the more this recession will continue to linger. When the boomers die out, we will be left with the burden of their baggage and we'll have to sort out a whole plethora of problems that could've otherwise been remedied years ago.
