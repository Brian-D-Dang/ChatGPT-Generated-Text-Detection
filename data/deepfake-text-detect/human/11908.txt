The vessel's engine failed a mile north east of Muck Island on Thursday evening. Weather conditions at the time were described as good with a Force 3 wind and a slight swell running. A volunteer crew from the Larne RNLI launched two lifeboats at about 18:30 BST. The lifeboat towed the yacht to Carrick Marina. Larne RNLI Deputy Launching Authority Philip Ford-Hutchinson said the call-out was "a great example of both our inshore and all-weather lifeboats working well together to assist the four people onboard the casualty vessel."
