Objectively speaking, the biological process of detecting pain exists in virtually all advanced animals, all the way down to some invertebrates through the neural process called nociception [SOURCE] . Animals are also conscious just as we are [SOURCE] . Since all advanced animals, including humans, have both the physical biology of pain detection, plus the capacity for subjective experience through consciousness, there is no doubt that they are able to experience the unpleasant sensation of pain. This truth is why I have decided to give up the pleasures of eating meat and dairy; avoid animal products; and (even as a neuroscience major) refuse to participate in, or support harmful animal testing. I believe those who do not are ignorant of the truth, too weak or apathetic to make these simple life changes, or they do not care out of selfishness. I'm aware these thoughts border on unhealthy misanthropy, which I want to change. So please change my view!
