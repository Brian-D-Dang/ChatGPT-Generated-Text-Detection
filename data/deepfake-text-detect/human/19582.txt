Many people have issues with man made global warming. Im actually skeptical on a different basis. I do not in fact think that the majority of experts believe what they say they do. There is very serious reason to say that you are a backer of man made global warming even if it not your belief. It is virtually impossible to get large amounts of funding on research if you dont, and 'save the world' research is where the money is at. I have witnessed some very important physicists completely 180 their global warming views when it suited them so they could get funding. (Anecdotal I am aware) If I was convinced that the vast majority of experts were backing it, I would accept that while I am allowed (and encouraged) to be skeptical, odds are im about the whole global warming thing. However this CMV is not for that matter. Background if necessary: I have a physics degree from a top uni and did a nuclear physics masters which had serious parts on climate effects. I work in the energy industry (Nuclear sector). Not sure if it relevant but people I talked to about this always seem to ask.
