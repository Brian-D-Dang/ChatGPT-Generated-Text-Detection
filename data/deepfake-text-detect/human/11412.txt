HQ, the makers of HQ Trivia, is closing down its business and laying off its 25 employees. CEO Rus Yusupov sent a note to employees informing them of the company's closure. HQ had received an acquisition offer from an established business but the deal didn't go through. The HQ Trivia app launched in 2017 and it quickly became popular due to its novel live nature, real cash prizes, and Scott Rogowsky playing the game's host. As the game became less popular, HQ tried to keep users engaged through extra in-game lives and an in-person event with a cash prize, but eventually, the game's novelty wore off and the company wasn't able to keep its users interested in its games.
