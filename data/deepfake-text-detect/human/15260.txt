I had to organize our company convention, I picked this show because I thought it would be fun. I had a private show, if you have 70 people or more you can have a private show. I was nervous because I wasn't sure if this would be a bad show. I'm glad I picked this show. I recommend if you have a corporate event you pick them very reasonable in price. It was worth every penny. Not only did they create a script just for us they did research on our company. They kept the group laughing so hard. Everyone left with a picture that's extra money but even with a picture and getting two drinks per person it was very affordable. (Affordable for a corporate event)
