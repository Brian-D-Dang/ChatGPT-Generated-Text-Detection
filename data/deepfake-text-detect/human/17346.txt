Growing up in the U.S. I was told about many of these mystical beings and was more or less convinced that they had to be real because my parents (who I should trust) kept telling me so. I believe kids can taught to be happy and content with the real world and do not need these fictional characters to have happiness. I believe the lies create a distrust between the child and the world and they can have a hard time being convinced what is true from what is fake. The child should be raised on the truth and be taught how to tell fact from fiction. Personal addition: My parents never even told me that these things were not true. It was just something I had to come to find for myself and just "grow out of" I feel like we should be honest with our kids encourage them to think accurately. CMV
