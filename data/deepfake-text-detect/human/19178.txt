the snowden leaks confirmed that both US and british intelligence agencies engage in social media manipulation. they pay people to comment on facebook, reddit and twitter, with the intention of marginalising, ridiculing and discrediting people who say things they dont like, I.E. people who criticise the anti-terror laws and data collection programs. the fact they think they can tell us what to think, and marginalise those who disagree with them, indicates to me that they no longer believe in democracy, they believe they must simply do what is best for us without our consent, and then try to justify it later on. if that is what they truly believe, they should do the right thing and campaign politically, give the people the chance to vote on it, rather than just doing it and then bullying their critics into silence. many of us are not willing to give up our right to privacy just to reduce the already insignificant probability of being killed by terrorists. by not letting us choose, they are denying us democratic representation, and violating the founding principles of the United States of America.
