I will start out by saying that I have been recently diagnosed with depression, and the only reason I started was because I was going to commit suicide. That being said I think that talk therapy is useless. Before I got to the point that I was going to take my own life, I talked my self through my issues, and reached conclusions. In my opinion, I think that therapy is only to validate one's own conclusions about there own life. In my situation, half of my family has depression and even my granddad committed suicide because of it. I think the only real solution is through medication, because it is do to a chemical imbalance in the brain, so in turn the only solution is to fix it through medication. CMV Hello, users of CMV!
