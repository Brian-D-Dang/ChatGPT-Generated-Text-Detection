I'm sure we've all heard "literally" used technically incorrectly. Examples like: 1. "Dad, you are literally hitler! Ugh!" 2. "This moose literally chased me half way across the state before I got away" 3. "I'm going to literally kill you if you don't stop clicking that pin." The whole point of using literally in this case is to increase emotional impact through exaggeration. Exaggerated analogy, exaggeration humor, exaggerated threat. These people, (excluding some youth) generally know what literally means, and they're using it wrongly, intentionally, for effect. If, however, we swap "literally" for "figuratively" in the examples above, it is more accurate to what is actually the case, but it loses the intent. Therefore, I believe generally the common use of literally is simply painting outside the lines for effect, not an ignorant use of the word that is changing its meaning. CMV EDIT: View changed!
