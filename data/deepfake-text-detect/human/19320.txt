Organic farming is supposed to be about creating an alternative to the unsustainable industrial agricultural system. They use different tools, like crop rotations, etc. However, one tool that they are arbitrarily prevented from using is seeds that have been genetically engineered. This is a weird rule and prevents them from using seeds with Bt traits (Bt is a pesticide used by more than 50 of organic farmers) that would help them reduce the amount of chemicals they use. There is also disease and virus resistance traits which would help them reduce inputs and boost yields. The only reason against this I could see is that organic is now a marketing label, not just a type of farming regulation. I would be most people who often buy organics are also against GMOs, which means that organic farmers have to make environmental compromises in order to satisfy their customers. Hello, users of CMV!
