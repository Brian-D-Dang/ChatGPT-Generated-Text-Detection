As I lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling; I closed my eyes and..... died. What did you expect? Some profound meaning insight to the world? The answer to world peace? You are a goddamn IT guy; you aren't going to save the world by sitting on your ass and fixing computers. If you want to do something memorable, go and make something happen. Well look at that, I guess was profound, in a way. edit: I noticed it said thus far, well I guess this is awkward..... I'mnot going to delete it though; I like it too much.
