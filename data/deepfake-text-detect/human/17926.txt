Passive smoking (inhaling second-hand smoke from nearby cigarette fumes) occurs in a vast variety of public environments, and has been linked consistently to nearly all of the same diseases a regular smoker can suffer from smoking cigarettes, as well as many others like sudden infant death syndrome. These findings have been confirmed over and over again including a series of studies from the USA from , the UK in 1998, Australia in 1997 and internationally in 2004. I not only think that smoking in public is a health risk, but I think it indicates an alarming lack of concern for others well-being. I respect the fact that people want to smoke, and have no issue if they do it within the confines of their property. However I find it unfair that smokers generally do not respect the fact I may not wish to breath in their second hand smoke.
