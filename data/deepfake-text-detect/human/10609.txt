A fever is your body deliberately getting hotter. It helps you beat an infection. So it's natural that you feel cold and try and warm up. Then when your body decides to switch back to normal temperature, it tries to cool down so you feel hot and sweaty. A fever that's less than 104 F 40 C is not dangerous. 'Hyperthermia' is different, it's when hot weather forces your body to overheat. So with that you'll feel hot.
