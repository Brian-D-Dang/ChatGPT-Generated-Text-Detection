My parents used Sparklett's for years, so I went with Sparklett's when I moved out on my own. I've had it for years and never really had any major problems, until now. I've lived at the same address for 10 years with the same service and all of a sudden, I can't get my water delivered according to their schedule. I've called several times and even put in for an extra delivery, but they won't drop off any water. I'm on autopay and have a zero balance, so that isn't the issue. I looked online and my delivery history has a note from a new delivery man stating that I either moved or died. No such luck, Mr. Delivery Man. More phone calls to their 800 number and still no water.
