I think sex ed in America has the same problem as most issues: it's too extreme. People advocate either teaching abstinence-only until you're married under all circumstances or handing out free condoms and birth control and telling kids to go at it because it's their right and it's fun. Personally, I think any responsible organization ought to inform students of reproductive health issues and explain how you can contract an STD or get pregnant. However, I feel like the risks of sex as a teenager far outweigh the rewards. Obviously, sexual exploration is a healthy and normal thing, and from experience, it can be quite fun. However, I don't believe that the average high school student has the maturity to weigh this against the multitude of consequences of their behavior. Sure, there is birth control, abortion, and methods of protecting yourself from disease, but they aren't 100 effective. Furthermore, birth control, condoms, etc. are only effective when used properly and responsibly. What did you do completely responsibly when you were 16? Lastly, I think everyone always ignores the emotional consequences of sexual activity and how it can go wrong. I just think if you weigh things logically, the risks outweigh the rewards of young people having sex, and that should be imparted to them. CMV Please. Hello, users of CMV!
