Homonymes (as did homophones) started out being writtenpronounced differently. It's actually a common fallacy to assume that the current state of a language is the 'right one' (you can see a lot of it in the word literally) but this isn't the case. Especially in language the lazy and volatile nature of humans shows itself very often. We tend to drop syllables, combine hiats (vowels that are pronounced as two separate vowels) to diphtongs (two vowels pronounced connected), the quality of vowels changes (that's the reason many English words are written different from how they are spoken. The writting was fixed before changes. There was a time when you really pronounced colour with that U), etc. However, there's one thing that should be mentioned: besides homonymes there are also polysemes. These are words that are written and pronounced the same but didn't start out as different words. These are mostly extended and conferred meanings of words like the word "star." Because celebrities "shine so bright" they get the same word as our sun.... edit So, in summary, because often times homonymes startes out different and are only now the same word end
