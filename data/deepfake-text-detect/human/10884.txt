When you go on a plane, or experience a similar kind of change in pressure, the eustachian tube (a tube that runs from the back of your mouth to the inner ear) can sometimes fail to properly equalise the pressure - it might partially or completely close. This can often cause a painful popping among other things, such as muffled hearing. The same thing you might notice happens when you yawn, because the act of doing so causes this tube to constrict.
