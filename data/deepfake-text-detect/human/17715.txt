This is why I hold my view: GDP per capita today in the US is at an all-time high. But all of that wealth is concentrated within a small group of people, like an oligarchy. Here's a quote from Senator Bernie Sanders (D) -Vt: "Today the Walton Family Walmart own more wealth than the bottom 40 of America." July 22nd, 2012-Twitter Look at that statistic, and tell me that it's not unfair. Trickle-downsupply-side economics (the way I see it) has grossly failed each time that it has been implemented. I perceive that under this current administration President Obama more or less has carried on these policies, at the expense of everyone else. The gap between the rich and poor is the greatest it's ever been. As Warren Buffet said: "There is a class war being waged, and we're winning." Wouldn't it be more beneficial for everyone if we moved towards a more egalitarian society?
