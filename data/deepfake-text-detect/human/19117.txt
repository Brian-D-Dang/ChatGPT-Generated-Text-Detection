So here is my issue, my rant if you will, we seem to have two lines of thinking in debate over wages (from my own observation):support for the workers wellbeing, and support for the firm ability to make a profit. Everything I have read, or seen, appears to fall into those two categories. The issue I have is that we are talking about the wrong thing, we talk about the results not the why. When the why of the basic wage rate comes comes up it is either that companies are evil, and care about profit - or that entry level workers are getting killed by today's entry wage rates. The issue is not about what the company goal is, but the companies incentive to pay more (risk versus reward). If we are so hellbent on increase entry level wage rates then we need to understand how the firm calculates how much to pay and why. What risk does the company take for paying the pay rate they do? Firms are not anymore evil then my toaster is. Firms simply do as it was program to do (calculate risk versus reward, and make a profit). Sure, some companies pay more for thier entry level positions (e.g., Costco) but they do this understanding the risk they take versus the reward they get. Even zoomies tries to buy out the employees at the end of thier training (another calculated risk versus reward). If we want to fix the obvious system, shouldn't we start by understanding it first? It just seems to me that people want to feel good and complain about something and this is an easyone to do it with. Tl:dr the debate over basic wages is wrong, we talk about the effects of the system, not the calculations driving it.
