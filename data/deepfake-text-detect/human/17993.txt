Free trade agreements such as [TPP] , [TTIP] , [TISA] and [GATS] require non-discrimination between domestic and foreign providers and between public and private providers. This will require that public services that have private competition will no longer be able to receive public subsidies. Eliminating public subsidies will allow the consumers of these services a choice in provider. With competition quality of service will go up and price of service will go down. Since governments will no longer be able to favor domestic over foreign firms consumers will get better services. One example is transportation. Foreign firms are currently prohibited from providing airline services between US cities. So a European airline flying from Los Angeles to London via New York can't transport passengers from Los Angeles to New York. Public schools will be replaced by private schools. Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security will be replaced by private insurance companies. If governments wishes to support low income citizens, money will need to be given directly to people as they will not be allowed to give the money to organizations. Another benefit will be the elimination of public libraries and parks replaced with private libraries and parks. About the only subsidy that governments will be able to provide is a basic income. The elimination of public services will be good for society as it will allow for more choice in providers, better quality, and lower prices. Hello, users of CMV!
