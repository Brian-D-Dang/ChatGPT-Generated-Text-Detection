I found that there was some hypocrisy in the media and among my social group when I would hear people running to the defense of Caitlin Jenner, and then immediately attacking Rachael Dolezal afterwords. I felt both stories where instances of fluidity. One was on Gender Fluidity, the other being Ethnic Fluidity. Assuming Rachael actually feels much more comfortable as a black woman, I don't see why she should not be one. I understand that it might be seen as an unfair comparison to say a sex change has the same weight as an ethnic change, but I can't help but think this decision on who we can and cannot be should not rest on society, but rather on ourselves. If we allow this, then perhaps we would see questions of "yes you have decided to be a girl, but are you the right kind of girl?" or "you believe to be a christian, but are you the right kind of christian? Oh, you are transferring from being a Buddhist? No, you can't do that, religion and spirituality isn't for you to decide." Now I know that these particular examples the best in this circumstance, but I guess I'm trying to get at what happens when we have society decide what is the "right kind" of race for you to be. TL;DR- Caitlin Jenner didn't get flack for a similar transformation, and what this should come down to is an individuals right to be who they feel comfortable being, not who society wants them to be.
