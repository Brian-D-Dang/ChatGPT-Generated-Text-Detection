You have to try their pumpkin with crispy rice and grilled food. It can't really compare to Raku but its the 2nd alternative best to Raku. This place is better than their sister restaurant Naked sushi. Even the sushi rolls here are done more professional. The service is good, too. They do have a pretty good sake menu which I love. This place is usually not super packed so there is no need to make reservation which is always a plus when you in the mood for good japanese food.
