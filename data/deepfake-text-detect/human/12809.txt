"Eve, come quick, check out this really cool snake-like creature" "I met him yesterday Adam. He's alright, a bit quirky and speaks in riddles, but he gave me this lovely looking fruit" Eve holds up fruit "Wow, that looks really tasty. Why haven't you eaten it yet?" "Well I'm a bit cautious because there was this message that came through the ship's security monitor. It warned against some of the nutrients that grow on this planet. It said they contain a certain enzyme that breaks down the synergy between us and our on-board eternal-life support machine" "Ahhh, don't worry all the time, live a little, that fruit looks good" "Hmm ok" Eve takes a bite Ship and all systems power down "Fuck"
