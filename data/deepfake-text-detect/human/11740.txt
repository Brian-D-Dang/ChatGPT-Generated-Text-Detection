Luminary is a platform for podcasts that will be launching in June. The new podcast app will focus on subscriptions and will be ad-free. Many big names have already signed up to the platform, with more than 40 exclusive shows already in the works. The subscription will be 8 a month and content creators will be paid upfront for their work, receiving a bonus if their audience numbers reach a certain threshold.
