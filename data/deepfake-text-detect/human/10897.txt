Depends on the terms of your loan. If the interest rate is fixed, then nothing. All that has changed is who is getting your money. If the interest is variable.... you're about to get hit. The new owner will adjust interest rates based on the estimated risk of you not paying it back. This could mean your rates go down.... or that they go up.
