I feel that Marijuana is a perfect relaxant after a stressful day. It shouldn't be illegal. But I think that people who are constantly high are very similar to people who are always drunk. They are escaping reality with their drugs. Marijuana may not be (long term) as harmful to the body as alcohol, but it is definitely as harmful to your development as a human being. Note, I do not have a problem with occasionally using marijuana as an enjoyable escape. I have a problem with people using it all the time to put off dealing with reality. I am especially interested to hear what self described stoners have to say about why their lifestyle is valid. Thank you.
