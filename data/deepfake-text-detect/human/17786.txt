I've recently read [this article] about how the Norwegian military integrated its troops so that they had unisex dorms and bathrooms. The women in the military report a drop in sexual harassment. It makes sense to me that if "separate but equal" does not apply to races, it shouldn't apply to genders. This is for several reasons: 1. It leads to disparities. Athletics teams receive vastly different treatment based on gender. 2. It leads to "othering" as evidenced in the military and gender specific schools. In the real world the genders will have to interact in pretty much every facet of business and social spheres, so it makes no sense to divide genders to educate or train. 3. Even if there are average differences between the sexes, there are always outliers. Certainly, boys learn differently from girls at different ages, but the differences within a group will always be greater than the differences between groups. Instead education should focus on educating the population as a whole and teaching students to navigate through these differences. If anyone can prove that there is some benefit to separating genders at any point for any reason, I would love to hear it. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
