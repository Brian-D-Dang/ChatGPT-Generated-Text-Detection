I have heard some rhetoric on how the pro-life stance is "misogynistic Misogyny is the hatred or dislike of women or girls and anti-woman." I can understand the "anti-woman" perspective to some degree: In order to protect the fetus, women's reproductive rights will have to be restricted. On the other hand, the idea that the pro-life stance is misogynistic is very strong claim. I remain unconvinced that this is true. If it makes a difference, I am pro-choice myself.
