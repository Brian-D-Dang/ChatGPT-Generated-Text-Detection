It's been 3 years since the explosion that ended my life. I was one of the lucky ones, killed instantly, didn't feel a thing. What I couldn't figure out at the time was why I was still here? I died, I should be gone, not floating around watching the world turn, unable to affect it. It's been 3 long years since I saw my body move without me. My corpse, along with the remains of the other 3000 people killed in the explosion, began shambling through the city, attacking others. For 3 excruciating years I have had to sit by and watch my body destroy lives and devour the innocent, but soon I will be strong enough. It took my a little while to figure it out. As my body would eat the flesh, my spirit would consume the emotion. Little by little I could feel my spirit gaining strength through the despair and agony of those my body slaughtered, and it was almost time. A push here, a pull there, I was beginning to be able to affect the world again. Soon I will take the hatred, pain, and sadness of 3 horrible years, and use it to transform into something stronger. I will become a poltergeist, and when I release my wrath I will destroy every zombie I can reach.
