Please don't explain whiskey Dick to a 5 year old.," "To get an erection, one's penile arteries have to dilate and veins constrict. Alcohol dilates blood vessels itself - arteries AND veins - and makes it harder to get the vein compression needed to maintain the erection.,I get why in general drunk hardons are harder to get, what I dont get is why Whiskey Dick was ever used as a term for it because Whiskey makes me randy as which in turn usually means im a walking stonk-on all night long till I get some. Its become a pattern, if I go to the drinks cabinet and pull out a red wine, my GF knows shes getting nothing, if I pull out the scotch, she goes and gets her good underwear on
