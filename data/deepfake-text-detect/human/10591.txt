They can't guarantee that every single molecule in the ingot is gold, so they give themselves leeway by calling it 99.9.

In natural earth conditions 100 pure is essentially theoretical for anything. As soon as something is exposed to the atmosphere there are contaminants and new molecular bonds happening.
