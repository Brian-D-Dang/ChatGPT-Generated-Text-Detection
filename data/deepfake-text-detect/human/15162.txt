Bath and Body, they have been around for a very long time. I do not know how long this one had been here though. I have not been to one in quite a bit of time. But, I had some fabulous coupons so I thought I would check it out once again. Things are as I remembered them. Which is a good thing. It is not good sometimes when things change too much. The deals are all quite good and you can find a lot of fun little stocking stuffer type things for a good price. Staff was nice and gave me even more coupons after my purchase. That is a good way to keep the peeps coming back for more.
