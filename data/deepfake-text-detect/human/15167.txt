My favorite place to get AYCE sushi. It's inside an old Italian restaurant that, when it was an Italian restaurant, looked really nice. 808 Sushi is not going to win any ambiance awards any time soon. Not the best looking place, but where it lacks in decor, it more than makes up for in rolls. This place has a VERY generous AYCE menu (and frequent AYCE cards so you can earn free ones). The rolls are always tasty, quick, fresh, and wrapped tight. It's hard finding a TERRIBLE sushi place in Vegas (but they exist, I'm talking to you Nagoya on Ft Apache) but if you live in the southwest this is the one of the only places I'd go.
