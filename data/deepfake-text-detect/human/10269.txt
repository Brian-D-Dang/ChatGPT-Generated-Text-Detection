I like Bernie, love his politics in fact. I doubt there is a politician I agree more with. I like the fact that, unlike most politicians, his rhetoric matches his actions. Whether it's filibustering Bush's tax cut extensions, standing up against Citizens United or proposing amendments to the Patriotic Act, this is a guy who's politics match mine. That being said, I find it problematic for a guy who's never sat as a Democrat and doesn't caucus as a Democrat to be running to be their leader. CMV Reddit, you can do it. EDIT: Far too many of these arguments are based on how folk view either Clinton or Sanders, which to me is inconsequential. The crux of the issue is whether or not an independent should be allowed to run under the party ticket.
