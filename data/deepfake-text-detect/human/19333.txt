Let me start by saying I do think they are pointless: the IWF already exists to block illegal content online in the UK and there are numerous (many of them free to download) internet filters available to parents to prevent children from viewing adult content online; there are no assurances that the government ones will work any better than these. However: Yes, they're opt-in, but the government is NOT saying "we are now enforcing a mandatory ban on all adult content online." For this reason I do not see the filters as posing a risk to civil rights in Britain, and I think likening these proposed optional filters to compulsory internet censorship in countries like Iran an China is insensitive and inflammatory. The right to free speech does not exist in the UK, and whilst I disagree with this, I think it would be much better to start there than by foaming at the mouth over a new filter which follows old rules.
