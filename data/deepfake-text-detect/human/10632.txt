Electricity and Magnetism are intrinsically linked. A moving electrical field (such as electricity through the wires) creates a magnetic field. A moving magnetic field creates an electrical charge. So what's happening with inductive heating is that basically you're using electricity to create a focused magnetic field, which is then turned back into electricity at the focal point (in the form of eddy currents, think swirling water around in a glass, but with electricity). Since it's putting more energy into the object than the object can get rid of, it heats up.
