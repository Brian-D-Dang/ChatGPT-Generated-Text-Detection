I look down at my hands in amazement. I start to cry as I remember the body that once was. The body that played every sport under the sun throughout school. The body that got its first dance and kiss from Mary in middle school. The body that stopped me from being bullied in high-school. The body that found Cindy and helped her fall in love with me. The body I almost destroyed in college. The body I signed up for the army with. The body which wore a tux on the wedding night before I was deployed. The body I went through basic with. The body that helped me excel and become a captain. The body that was in the Humvee when the IED went off. The body that lied on the ground and cried out as it was torn apart. The body that say more of itself 20 feet away then it did attached to it. Now looking down I cry, because I finally have hands again.
