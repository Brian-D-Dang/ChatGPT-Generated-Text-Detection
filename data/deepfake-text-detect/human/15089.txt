I've been a member for over 2 years now. At first, I loved the change from the usual local gym. The instructors were awesome! They were happy and amazing. However the past 6 months or so, the studio has lost it's appeal. And the soap in the bathrooms. Wth, isn't that a health code violation?! The signs that are up asking for tips to keep the instructors are also tacky. Too bad too. This was a perfect location and atmosphere.
