I think depression shouldn't be considered a mental illness anyway, but rather a reaction to a crappy and sick society and an unjust world. I believe that no amount of idealistic quotes, motivational speeches and medications could change it. Sure, the person might become happier from one or more the things above but the society that drove them to depression will force them back into it again. Being happy is not going change the fact that you are behind in your mortgage, or that your town's water supply is toxic, or that killings around the world continue to happen. I think it's wrong and a disservice to blind someone again, just so they can fall yet again. Want to lower the rate of depression? Sure; I'm all for it, just fix the society in which depression occurs.
