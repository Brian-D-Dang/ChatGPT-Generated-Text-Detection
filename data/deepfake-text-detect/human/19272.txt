If it matters for some odd reason, I own three guns. But really, I don't think this matters. I don't understand why killing to protect oneself can be protected by law, but protecting oneself with a non-lethal action is not, or at least, less protected. Even if I feel my life is in danger, I don't want to kill. I'm a decent shot. I feel confident I can hit a leg at close range. But often legally, this puts me in a worse situation. Even when a 'stand your ground' law isn't on the books, I've been advised that it's always better to shoot to kill. If for no other reason than the other guy can't tell his story when he's dead. I just don't want to kill someone if I don't have to. If I was facing a gun, shoot to kill. But if someone was coming after me with a knife or baseball bat and I have the opportunity not to kill, why am I less protected legally for sparing someone's life? Also, yes, I know that a knife is extremely dangerous from even 20 feet since they can close the gap before most people can drawload a gun. Let's assume I already have my gun out. IE I wake up at night and hear someone downstairs.
