I can see some objections to this: 1) Refusing blood transfusion isn't always a death sentence. Yes, but the refusal is not conditioned upon whether death is imminent or not. And in many cases - it is. 2) One of them is an active action, while the other is passive. I am unconvinced that this is important. Something else? At it's core - I was under the impression that this was a self determination issue - and in this case I don't see why the two should be treated differently? I picked Jehovah's witness because it is the case in medical ethics I hear most about. Acknowledging that there doesn't exist an imperative to prevent death - why should we not allow people the right to die - passive or active. A closer example might be DNR - but CPR has a low success rate. Is there a real difference between not administering a procedure which will most definitely save someone's life on their request and administering a treatment to end their life? Please do not focus on the Jehovah's witness aspect of this CMV. Edit: I'll be back in 12 hours. I know that there is a technical difference between passive and active action, but why is it morally relevant in this case? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
