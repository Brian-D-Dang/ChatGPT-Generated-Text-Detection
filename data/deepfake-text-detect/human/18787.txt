A few weeks ago, a woman who was formerly a Baltimore Ravens cheerleader was arrested for rape after allegedly having sexual relations with a 15 year-old boy. This story is not all that unique, as there are plenty of instances when older women, often teachers, have been arrested for having sex with males under the age of consent. And while I don't necessarily think that women in these cases should not be punished at all, I think punishing them as much as older men who prey on young girls is also not appropriate. I don't think it's a controversial statement to say that males are naturally more sexually aggressive and promiscuous than females. That is seen across cultures and even across species. Simply put, men want sex more than women, they just do. Sure 14 or 15 year old boys may not have the mental andor emotional capability to fully consent to sex, but pretending that boys at that age don't want sex is completely disingenuous and so is pretending that girls by and large are as driven by sexual motives as boys. Furthermore, adolescent boys are often physically bigger and stronger than older women, so feelings of coercion in that respect are not as pronounced if the genders were switched. So, please, explain to me why there shouldn't be a double standard in this scenario. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
