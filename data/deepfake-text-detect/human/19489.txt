Let's get this out of the way. I'm a white hetero Cis male. I think many aspects of society institutionally discriminate and displace women, racialethnic minorities, non heteros, the mentally disabled etc. That said I think the tack Jezebel takes is incredibly flawed and counter productive. I'm not an MRA and I actually think a large amount of people involved in the MRA subreddit have some pretty problematic views and attitudes. That said running an article titled "Fuck You MRA" isn't advancing your cause. Hugo Schyzer has already recently admitted most of his columns were "clickbait," but Jezebel editors ran them.
