"Keeping up with current events" sounds pretty useful, but in reality, the majority of news stories you see on television have very little impact on your daily life. Thus, readingwatching people report about stuff like homicides and car crashes really serves no purpose to anyone besides the people involved. It is arguably important that as a person on the earth you should be well informed of its happenings, but very little of the news contains anything that will change how you go about your life. Besides any major news that will drastically change the worldparts of the world or how you live your life, much of it is useless and depressing information. With that considered, hearing about other people's misfortune that I can't and won't do anything about, and won't affect me seems absurd; I don't understand why anyone else would do it. I know I'm being a little hyperbolic, but it just seems pointless, and for people that turn on their tv to watch the news everyday, a morbid and depressing way to pass the time.
