This could've gone gimmicky but instead it's a fun little watering hole with tasty, strong drinks and fabulous service. Had a round of the eponymous cocktail at the bar and was impressed by the bartender's execution and presentation. Fun unique little spot - grab a seat at the bar, it got busy fast even on a weeknight.
