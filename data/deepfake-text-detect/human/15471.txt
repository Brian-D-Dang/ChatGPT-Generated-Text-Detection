We called 45 min ahead to arrange for a cab to meet our bus, which was coming from Chicago airport. When we reached Memorial Union our cab was there, but had arranged for two other fares to share the Prius without our knowing about it so there was no room for us or our luggage. I told the driver this and he rudely said, well, you knew it was a small car. I then called the dispatcher, who said, part of being green is sharing rides and that this is our policy I had to explain again that we hadn't been informed of their'policy' and that due to their policy we were standing in the cold at 10 PM after 12 hours of travel. I won't use them again. (We've since learned that member-owned Union Cab provides better service AND has added hybrids to its fleet we use them now exclusively).
