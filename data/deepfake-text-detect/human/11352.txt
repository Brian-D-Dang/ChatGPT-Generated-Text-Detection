Particle3D is a company that is pioneering a novel method for 3D printing lightweight, customized bone implants that fuse with the skeleton before slowly disappearing. While surgeons have been using tricalcium phosphate (TCP) in reconstructive surgery for decades, they have to manually sculpt shapes from solid blocks, which limits the potential positive effects of TCP. 3D printing TCP allows for more porous implants, which allows the structures to function as scaffolds for blood vessels and natural bone to grow. The implants degrade over time and are replaced by natural bone. It is possible to store medicine inside the porous material. Trials on pigs and mice have shown that new bone marrow and blood vessels can develop in the implants within eight weeks.
