I'm giving this location 1 star because the service is horrible!! The yogurt is yummy, but every time I have gone the lady working at the register has been very disconnected and unfriendly!! A number of times the door has been locked and the store hours say open... And though I have gone at 11 am everyday and it's usually open, last week the door was locked again at 11:30; she came to the door, peaked out and said what?? I said id like some yogurt.... She said we don't open until 12:30 now! I asked why it had suddenly changed and she said it hasn't had much business before then and then she just shut the door..no smile nothing!! I usually love sincerely yogurts, but this location is by far the worst as far as friendly employees!!!: I wouldn't recommend coming here because the doors may not be open!!
