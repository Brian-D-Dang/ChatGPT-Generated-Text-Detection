I have heard about its technical intricacies and enduring beauty, but none of them could justify its popularity to me. It's a great painting, no doubt, but there are many other Renaissance paintings that are just as intricate and beautiful. It wasn't ahead of its time. It didn't portray anything particularly artistic or significant. I don't look at the [Mona Lisa] and go 'Wow, what a masterpiece!' To me it just looks like an ordinary women sitting with a half smirk against a random background. In contrast, [The Storm] is a painting that leaves a much deeper impression on me. It has motion, it has fantasy, it has a story that immediately puts you in an appreciative mood. And I don't even think it's the best painting ever. I think that the value of the Mona Lisa has been largely inflated by hype and a modern fascination with Leonardo da Vinci, the poster child of the Renaissance. Can anyone attempt to change my view?
