First I would like to clarify: anyone who wishes to drive a vehicle on public roadways should meet their state's requirements to do so. HOWEVER, I think it is just plain silly that you must present a physical copy of your license to an officer if pulled over. Every police vehicle (to my knowledge) has a computer with internet connection that can access a database of licensed drivers. I got pulled over a few years ago and had forgotten my license at home. It was easy as: "Do you have your license?" "No, I do not have it on me." "Okay, well do you have a license at all?" "Yes. I just do not have the physical copy with me." The officer went back to his car, plugged in my first and last name, and had all the credentials my physical license would have provided him with in seconds. Why wouldn't this just be the norm? It seems that a physical piece of plastic is a fickle medium for that information when an officer can easily access a database with the same info. in a matter of seconds. I am not saying physical drivers licenses should not be issued at all. They are a useful and credible way to provide identification. However, I do not think it should be illegal to operate a motor vehicle without that license in your possession. CMV!
