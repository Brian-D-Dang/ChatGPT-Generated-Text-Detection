This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point is that if some undesirable outcome is a logical consequence of some action or ideology, then people who don't want that outcome, will try to figure out how to do that action or fallow that ideology without causing that outcome. I think that people and societies in general are smart enough andor reasonable enough to know when it would be bad to fallow something to a logical conclusion and so they will stop before they get there. If that makes them a hypocrite, then so be it. I'm perfectly fine with people being hypocrites if it keeps them from doing something unfavorable. So tell me, am I wrong to see things this way?
