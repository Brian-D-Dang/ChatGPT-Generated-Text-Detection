Currently valuable property such as real estate and vehicles are registered as to ownership. Registration reduces the amount of theft of these types of property, To reduce theft of other property, all valuable property should be registered. This would require that all valuable property has a unique identifier. One option for this unique identifier are low cost RFID tags which cost less than 0.50. To reduce the cost of registration, the owner could register sale of the item using a web site. A registration of property would also be useful for insurance claims. Hello, users of CMV!
