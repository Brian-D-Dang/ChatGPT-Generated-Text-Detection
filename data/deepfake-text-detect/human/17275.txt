I started asking myself, where is the line that would make a sweat shop worker's life worse than that of a "slave"? Well, you'd think a slave would be trapped in... slave housing. So, do sweat shoppers work in slave housing? Yes. Take people making iphones, or samsung galaxy phones. Their working conditions seem fairly similar to the conditions of workers during the industrial revolution that weren't paid in actual money, but were paid in company scrip, and were forced to live in company housing. Slaves have no financial independence... Those apple, and samsung employees, and similar sweat shop workers are in perpetual debt. Sweat shop workers are often confined, forced to stay inside a company compound. Some have 1 day a week that they can leave, some probably don't have that. So I have to believe, if a sweat shop worker looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it's a duck. If it looks like a slave, and quacks like a slave, then they're a slave.
