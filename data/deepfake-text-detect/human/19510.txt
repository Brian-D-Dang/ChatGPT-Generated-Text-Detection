I contend that being a bit overweight (ideal weight plus up to 15 greater e.g., if ideal weight for man is 160 lbs. then up to 184 lbs.) is not such a big deal all things considered. Health studies have conflicted on whether or not (see ) packing a few extra pounds is good for you. What most studies say is that it is not necessarily bad for you either. Too many overweight people I think strive to look like models and athletes when dieting. They overdo the dieting and when it fails go back to their prior weight gain. If they would only keep their weight within a reasonable range, they might not look like a hunk or a beauty, but most doctors would consider it a success. Society should too.
