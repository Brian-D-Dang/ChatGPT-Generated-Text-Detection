Now first off let me say I do not under any circumstance think being homosexual is wrong. I am actually a strong supporter of homosexual rights, I think people should have the right to be happy, no matter their lifestyle as long as it doesn't harm anyone else's right to be happy. That being said I think being gay is a choice, either made consciously or subconsciously. It irks me when people say it's not a choice when to me it makes me question IF it was a natural occurrence, what is the purpose for it in nature? If our goal as a species is to continue the line of our species, what purpose does something that makes a person unable to reproduce serve? They then become another mouth that needs to fed, another person to use our valuable resources of survival as an animal, just to die and not continue with another generation... it would be a waste of life from a strictly "survival of our species" perspective. Only possibility I see is that it is a mutation that makes it "natural" but a mutation would give the fundies a god damned field day, because then it really would be an "abomination." Is there anyone that can change my view of this?
