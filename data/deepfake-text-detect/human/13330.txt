And so just like that my life was changed forever. Overnight, I had gone from carefree teenager to..... this. While other boys my age spent their days thinking about the Premier League and Miss Miller's legs I had completely lost all sense of reality, of what existence meant. Every night when I lay down in bed, I saw their faces. I saw them like I always remembered them, so happy and carefree. They look at me with such innocent eyes, such carefree faces, and that is what hurts most of all. It wasn't my fault. I was so naive, so stupid! I never meant to do anything that would ever harm you. I tell them this every night. I write this on the walls. I scratch it onto my skin. I scream into the empty air. Anything. I'd do anything for them to hear. The expression on the faces I see never change. The vision I see is only temporary, a mirage of my desolate state. And this is how I know that they are gone forever.
