CMV: ISIS isn't about the US, it isn't about Bush or Obama. ISIS was created because of internal forces within the gigantic Islamic world. It isn't about us, and to think it is is just arrogent and self centered lazy thinking. I hear lots of people arguing that it is the actions of X or Y president that caused ISIS to exist, but I think the internal ideologies and economic, cultural an political forces within the middle east are much more significant than anything the US did, even the US invasion, or whatever the US did or didn't do afterward may have only slowed or hastened such an explosion in the middle east for a few years.
