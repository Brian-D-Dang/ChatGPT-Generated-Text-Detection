Almost always. If you are willing to pay a high enough price, or sell at a low enough price, you can almost always strike a deal. Occasionally, when there is some earthshaking event that moves the stock, sellers outnumber buyers (or vice versa) be so much it can be hard to find a trading partner. Also, off the major exchanges, you have penny stocks. They are usually very small companies that are thinly traded. With those you can sometimes have trouble finding a partner.', "No, there is not always a guaranteed buyer. However, that is usually not an issue in major exchanges (the NYSE, NASDAQ, etc). You see it more often in pink sheetover the counter stocks. You can look and see the volume of shares that trade hand on a daily basis. If it is very low or near zero then it's likely that company doesn't have any buyers. You can also look at the bid and the ask- this is what someone is willing to pay and what someone is looking to sell for. If there is a big gap between those then shares won't change hands even if there are buyers.
