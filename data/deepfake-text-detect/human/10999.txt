Urine isn't all that good for you. It's made up of water and some dissolved substances the body got rid of. These waste products make up a small part of the urine, so you can get away with drinking it in an emergency situation when your priority is getting water into your body. Seawater also has substances dissolved in it, mainly salt. However, the salt is present at a much higher concentration. Since salt dries out living things, drinking something salty will have the opposite effect as drinking water. Drinking either substance won't immediately kill you or anything like that. However, urine is made up of a larger proportion of water, so it at least fulfills the purpose of rehydrating the drinker.,While seawater will kill you in large amounts, a crazy Frenchman named Alain Bombard once crossed the Atlantic in a small boat, eating fish and drinking a small amount of seawater.
