Okay, as a white person submitting a question like this I honestly feel that I have to prove I'm not a racist first. Yea it's a really typical and cliche thing to say, but regardless I feel I have to say it anyway. On a personal level I don't judge people by race. I have "minority" friends who I have very interesting and intellectual conversations with. My sister is dating a black guy who is awesome and I would even say that I trust with my life with him. He has been there for me when my other friends haven't. However I feel on a broader scale that minorities are so underrepresented in the media and through politics that they feel disenfranchised. I feel that this underrepresentation makes them distrust white people. Most of the white people they have interacted with have been some sort of authority figure, whether that be a cop, teacher, security guard or judge. And I feel that this generalization and distrust of white people is present when I am in a "minority" neighborhood. I also feel thar their culture contributes to violence. Things such as not "snitching" and cooperating with police, and rap music glorifying crime and violence contributes to this. I understand this all on a certain level. I love rap music talking about selling crack and killing cops and all that shit. However I know it's just music. I feel there are definitely people (especially young ppl) who take it seriously. I also feel that the fact that ethnically minority neighborhoods are typically less wealthy leads to robbery and crime. Please try to convince me that although I'm white I should feel comfortable In minority neighborhoods. Anybody I don't get back to today I definitely will tomorrow, thanks.
