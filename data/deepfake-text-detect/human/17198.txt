I've read about troubles some studios have in producing films with big-name actors where the high rates these actors charge forces the studio to keep them off the camera as much as possible by depicting them with CGI or stuntmen. Actors who charge so much that studios are trying to keep them as much out of the movie as possible, in some cases hindering movie development or keeping certain movies from being, seem like money-centered assholes who only care about their revenue and not acting, or their fans, or entertaining.
