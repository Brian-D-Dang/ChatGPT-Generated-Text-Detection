Frequently as soon as a new film comes out in the cinemas, I hear complaints from everywhere saying that they think that the book was better. I think this has been the case with as good as movie adaption I can think of including Harry Potter, Twilight or The Great Gatsby. In my opinion movies should be seen as an individual piece of work and not be judged negatively because of its different media predecessor. Because it is a different media, it might also deliver a different experience and therefore disappoint some people because of their expectations.
