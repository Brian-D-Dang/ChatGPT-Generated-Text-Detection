This establishment leaves A LOT to be desired. Table service is extremely poor. Visited on 82313 for a retirement party in the back room where 1 server was assigned to handle the entire room (30 people) while her apparent sidekick was wiping down televisions. Waited 30 minutes for a drink order from the bar and 45 minutes for mediocre, COLD food. If you are drinking alcoholic beverages, you are far better off getting up and going to the bar yourself. I didn't bother complaining because I simply didn't have the time after waiting so long - and if I did, I didn't feel like waiting for a manager when they probably could care less. This place has great potential, but unfortunately it's a waste which is a sign of poor management decisions. Just shut the doors now and save yourselves the trouble. So many better choices downtown than this toilet.
