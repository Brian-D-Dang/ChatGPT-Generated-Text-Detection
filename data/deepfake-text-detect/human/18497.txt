With the limited research I did for this post, I found that funeral processions can just keep going through intersections in one long, eternal line. I just don't see why other than moral values of family unity. However, death is inevitable. Why hold up other in traffic for minutes at a time and possibly endanger others just to stay together. I don't know, it just doesn't seem logical to make special exceptions for a coffin. Change my view by providing legitimate reasons for these laws to exist other than "feels."
