I have a friend, Chris. Chris is a very chill guy. I have no hatred towards Chris, I don't think he's weird, I don't feel uncomfortable around him, I address him as Chris and use masculine pronouns to refer to him. But I just think of him as being a girl named Christie who feels like a guy and therefor decides to dress in a masculine way and call himself Chris and behave in a masculine way. I'm extremely conflicted on this because I feel guilty about it, like my feelings are the result of my bigotry. And I don't want to be bigoted. The idea that I'm engaging in something akin to homophobia is really abhorrent to me. I'm not posting here because I'm looking for an argument, I genuinely want someone to explain this to me in a way that changes the way I see this. I think the primary reason this bothers me is that I've been told that it is transphobic for heterocismen (such as I am) to object to dating transwomen on the basis of their trans-ness. I just don't see transwomen as being actually women. I wouldn't deny them the right to maintain official documents (licenses, passports) with their trans-gender or anything like that, just, in my mind a woman is a ciswoman and a man is a cisman. please CMV (throwaway because I'm worried about a backlash over this admittedly emotionally heated topic)
