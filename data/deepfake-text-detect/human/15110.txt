Just terrible. Sign outside says 5 drafts - night special, Tilted Kilt night. Great, we say! We'd love a happy hour draft on a hot day. We walk in, find a seat at the crowded bar, and order two Miller Lites. Bill comes, and we're charged 16. What!? I ask, he tells me the 5 is for industry night, and only applies to those in industry. What does that even mean? I say the sign does not say that, and he argues it does. I go out to the sign three times to confirm, and every time tell him it does not. He says, well you're wrong, but because you're causing an issue, I will just charge you 10. Of course you will, because I am not wrong (and, isn't the customer always right anyways?), and you really should check your signs, and honor them. Maybe most of the people that come in here have really taken Vegas to the extreme so do not notice the bill, but that's just dishonest business. Never again in this location. Never again in any location.
