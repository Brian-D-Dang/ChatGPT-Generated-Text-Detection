"We didn't think it would happen this soon," thought the MIT robotics prodigy as he wrestled with an android. In the middle of his struggle, Aaron Ito, a genius the likes of which only come once a century, found himself pondering the end of human existence. "We were nowhere near the singularity. Nothing we leave behind will last." A great disappointment washed over him. The discoveries and technological advances Ito had made in recent years led the entire scientific community into seeing him as the savior who could stop the global crisis. The human population was plummeting rapidly. And yet here he was, Ito thought, tired and weak. Another dumb robot had felled him. It happened this way every time. He felt great during intercourse, but after his orgasm a deep regret would inevitably skin in. "I'm ready for another round." The sexbot positoned itself on its back on top of Ito's wrinkled, abandoned science papers. "Do the thing with the finger again." The sex was just too good.
