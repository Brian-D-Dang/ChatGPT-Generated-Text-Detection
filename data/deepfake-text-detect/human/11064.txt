The way it makes sense to me... Let's say I want to turn a bolt 180 degrees. If I use a 1-inch long wrench, my hands won't travel very far to accomplish this goal, because the arc is small. If I use a 3-foot long wrench my hands will move a lot more distance to accomplish the same goal. Sort of like how a block and tackle pulley system makes it easier to lift a weight but means I must use much more rope than the distance I actually want to lift the weight.,Torque is measured in Nm Increasing the radius increases the circumference of a circle. When you increase the distance of which torque is applied, the length of the arc increases. As such, the meters the force is applied to increases. If torque is to remain equal, N must decrease. So when you put all of your strength into turning a 10cm wrench, it does a lot less than putting all of your strength into a 1m wrench.', "It's the law of the lever, which states that if the distance from the handle to the fulcrum is greater that the distance from the fulcrum to the head, the lever amplifies the input force. In the case of a wrench, the fulcrum and head are in virtually the same place so the longer it is, the greater the amplification.
