When I'm hanging out with people I don't know too well, I have a tendency to self-censor myself from the conversation unless I feel like I have something that's really worthwhile to contribute. Especially in a group of friends who are close with each other and are sharing intimate stories or inside jokes, it makes me even more hesitant to speak up since I'm afraid of people not acknowledging what I said or thinking it's stupid. Speaking 1-on-1 with someone or if I have a defined purpose (work or a project) I don't have this problem as much, but it gets worse in groups since I feel like everyone is judging what I'm saying. Logically speaking I know that if I said something dumb or socially unacceptable most people would probably forget it by the next day. But I just can't convince myself that it's better to try, fail, and get back up rather than never take the risk in the first place. Edit:Added some more info. Hello, users of CMV!
