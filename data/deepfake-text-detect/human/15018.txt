I have been to the old location on Paradise a few times in the past. I thought over time it became overrated. When they moved to a larger place I thought maybe the food would have improved. Not really. I still think its overrated and the tapas are slightly above average. I am sure I will be back a few times because my friends LOVE Firefly. The next time I eat here I will most likely get an entree instead of tapas. PROS: Tres Leches chocolate cake Chorizo and clams Great place for a group to try many different dishes. Ribeye Steak and truffle fries (entree) CONS: Spicy Beef salad - the salsa verde didn't mix with the other ingredients Pulpo Asado - the octopus was good but the tomato, paprika lemon vinaigrette didn't mix. Lemon Berry Tarts - the berries were good but the tart cups taste like they came out of a box.
