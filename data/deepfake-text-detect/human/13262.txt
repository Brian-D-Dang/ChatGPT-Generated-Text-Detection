The world just wasn't the same once he was gone. In fact, most educated folk these days would say his death was the reason everything went so badly down hill, but not for the reasons you'd assume. John Stevens, the man who had united humanity, and whose death had left it in tatters, was at best a controversial figure. Depending on who you asked, he was either the world's saviour or the one sent to destroy it. No one really knows what happened on that night, but the world was too preoccupied with the mess it created to really investigate, and so the mystery was laid to rest. I, of course, was far too young back then to understand what that death would spell for my future, and for the future of everyone I know. Had I been aware, I have little doubt that I would have joined the chorus of weeping that rang out on the streets.
