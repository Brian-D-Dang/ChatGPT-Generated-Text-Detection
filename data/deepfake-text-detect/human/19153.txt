Whenever I press my fellow developers for a definition of OOP, they all give different and often demonstrably wrong answers. I've heard things like, "OOP is interfaces" and "OOP is encapsulation," which aren't unique to OOP whatsoever. I've heard "OOP gives you code reuse" and the usual answer to my followup is inheritance. It seems to me (and even many OOPers) that while inheritance can provide code reuse, it's often a terrible idea in the long run. People claim all sorts of benefits from OOP, but all I can see that it provides is inheritance (brittle relationships). CMV
