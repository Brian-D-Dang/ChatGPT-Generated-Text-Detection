I understand that the book of Genesis may not exactly coincide with evolution, but that is a weak point in the debate since science had not progressed to the understanding of evolution at that period. I am mostly looking for contradiction within the text. The fact that people lived upwards of 500 years in the bible is irrelevant to this conversation, too. I would like to be convinced from parts of the bible that contradict other parts of the bible as I haven't found any. I know there are a lot of atheists on Reddit and I am interested in hearing their side of this debate. I have heard and read there is archaeological evidence supporting some historical facts in the Bible including the existence of King David and of Isiah's prophecy of Christ long before Christ was born. Also, the fact the apostles held on to their beliefs so rigidly and faced terrible death gives testament to its truth. C.S. Lewis used the four L's to logically "prove" Christ is Lord. The point about the Bible being God-breathed and having no errors is that, if it is not, and that it is incorrect or written by man, the whole power and truth of it falls apart. (I know it was literally written by man) For some autobiographical information, I was not raised Christian, but have been studying some of the bible on campus and this seems to be the pillar upon which all of Christianity stands. If this is not true, the Bible is just another mythology Edit: You guys win. I think to say the Bible has no errors is incorrect. I am especially thankful for the discrepancies of the witness accounts of Jesus. I am not sure if I no longer believe in god or Jesus because of this, but I will think of the Bible a little differently.
