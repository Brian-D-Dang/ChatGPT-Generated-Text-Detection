Awesome popcorn and great service. We stopped by this location for the 1st time on Saturday and we're very impressed with the popcorn options and the great service we received from the guy working. I asked him to seal the tin we purchased, and since my husband wanted to snack on the popcorn, he gave my husband a small cup of popcorn. It was very sweet!
