I'm not insane. I'm not insane. Joshua sits alone in a room pacing. He knows that the free world is in imminent danger but nobody believes him. I'm not insane. I'm not insane. Joshua sees things. He can see the future. He tries to tell people, and that's what got him in the insane asylum. I'm not insane. IM NOT INSANE! 7 days ago he saw a vision of a terrorist attack on the White House, then a nuclear explosion in New York. IM NOT INSANE! IM NOT INSANE! Joshua knows he has a unique power. He knows what is going to happen. Any minute now. He explains his vision to a guard and the guard giggles. One hour later Joshua's first prediction came true. I told you. I TOLD YOU! The president is dead. Joshua thinks they will listen now, but instead they begin throwing accusations. Joshua is charged just because he knew about the attack. It's ok. It's ok. He is sentenced to death, but doesn't care. In 3 minutes, the executioner wouldn't be alive to kill him. Nobody would.
