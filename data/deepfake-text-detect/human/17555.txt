I've loved Loveless ever since I first heard it as a youngster, but never really bothered with the debut up until recently when they released MBV (which I think is fantastic just for the record) and every single review said something along the lines of "the band burst onto the scene with instant classic "Isn't Anything"." I personally find the record very badly produced, very badly recorded, and basically full of loose chord loops masquerading as songs, but everything I ever hear about it is overwhelmingly positive. Is there something I'm missing? Some sort of different way of looking at it that suddenly opens it up on a whole new level? I really wish I could appreciate this record as much as the other two. Please CMV.
