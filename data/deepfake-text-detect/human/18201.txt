I see many lesbian couples were one (or both) people look, talk, and act like men. It is obviously a conscious effort to be masculine. I guess I'm just not sure why if you like females, you want a female that could be mistaken as for man, unless sexual orientation is soley about sexual organs for these people... Change my view
