Easy in, easy out! I also love Whole Foods, but I find that I always buy a bunch of things that look good that I don't need when I go there. They have most of the same products in their health aisle. I've been very pleased with the organic produce I have purchased from here. Keep in mind that it is like a Trader Joes, in the sense that they do carry some non-organic items. So, for a quick trip, Sprouts does the trick.
