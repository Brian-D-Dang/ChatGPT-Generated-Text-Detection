Understanding the formation of subjective human traits, such as preference and opinions, is an important, but poorly explored problem. An essential aspect is that traits collectively evolve under the repeated action of social influence interactions, which is the focus of many quantitative studies of cultural dynamics. In this paradigm, dynamical models require that all traits are fixed when specifying the "initial cultural state." Typically, this initial state is randomly generated, from a uniform distribution over the set of possible combinations of traits. However, recent work has shown that the outcome of social influence dynamics strongly depends on the nature of the initial state: if this is sampled from empirical data instead of being generated in a uniformly random way, a higher level of cultural diversity is found after long-term dynamics, for the same level of propensity towards collective behavior in the short-term; moreover, if the initial state is obtained by shuffling the empirical traits among people, the level of long-term cultural diversity is in-between those obtained for the empirical and random counterparts. The current study repeats the analysis for multiple empirical data sets, showing that the results are remarkably similar, although the matrix of correlations between cultural variables clearly differs across data sets. This points towards robust structural properties inherent in empirical cultural states, likely due to universal laws governing the dynamics of culture in the real world. The analysis suggests, first, that this dynamics operates close to criticality and second, that it is driven by more than just social influence, implications which were not recognized previously.
