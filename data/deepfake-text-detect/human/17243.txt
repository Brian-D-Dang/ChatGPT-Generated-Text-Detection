Whenever a violent crime, for whatever reason, comes to national or international attention, the inevitable refrain is that the perpetrator was simply insane and any possible environmental, ideological or political motivations on the perpetrator's part are inconsequential - unless they're Muslim, of course. Any writings by the perpetrator that may shed light on why they did what they did or even those which directly address their actions are dismissed as the ravings of a lunatic. 1.) This ingrained response hampers efforts to prevent violent crimes by ignoring all possible causes of the violence bar mental illness. Violent crimes therefore become seen entirely as individual acts by deranged people and the possibility of them being symptoms of an environmental, cultural or political climate are ignored. 2.) It is deeply distasteful to presume that a person's violent actions are the result of mental illness, especially considering that the mentally ill are less likely to commit violent acts than the general population and far more likely to be the victim of such acts.
