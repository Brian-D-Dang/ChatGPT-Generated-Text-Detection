The croquet Madame was delicious! I was surprised by the serving size, I couldn't finish the whole sandwich. The fresh made bread was great, soft slightly dense inside and really made the sandwich. The egg was cooked perfectly (something I've found to be a variable at many restaurants). I also got a white mocha coffee it was very good as well.
