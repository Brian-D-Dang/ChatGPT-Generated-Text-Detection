you would think a gradual dying off would make for a more sustainable economy and job market they aren't dying off though - that's the issue. people are living way longer than they used to and that's very expensive to maintain. Not just duration, the amount of time that money is spent on them, but actual costs, we spend more per year. A lot more. Medicine, procedures, etc are all way more expensive than they used to be (used to be mostly non-existent)," "Programs like Social Security and pensions worked when there are 4-5 workers for every retiree receiving those benefits, because the payouts to retirees are coming from payments coming in from current workers.... it's harder for programs to remain solvant when there are only 2-3 workers for each retiree paying in. Additionally, as life expectancy increases, so too does the payments made once somebody retired. So in that regard the problem isn't so much retiree aging and opening up jobs as the problem is them collecting retirement benefits for 30-40 years instead of 10-20.
