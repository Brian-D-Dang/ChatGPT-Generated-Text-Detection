Consensus reports from the UN's National Research Council's 16 year long study on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation maintain, "There is no threshold of exposure below which low levels of ionizing radiation can be demonstrated to be harmless or beneficial." As noted in [Wikipedia] : "While the French Academy of Sciences stated in their 2005 report concerning the effects of low-level radiation that many laboratory studies have observed radiation hormesis. However, they cautioned that it is not yet known if radiation hormesis occurs outside the laboratory, or in humans." The U.S. is pushing hard to sway public trust in favor of nuclear power, to the extent they are willing to downplay its very real dangers and risks, and even lie outright to the American people. In the wake of Fukushima and a renewed push-back, pro-nuclear lobbyists have attempted to convince the public that some small levels of radiation are harmless, and may even be good for youbut I'm far from convinced. CMV EDIT: For clarity, let me rephrase. I believe that there is no level of radiation which can be proven harmless, or beneficial, to humans. To use the example of radiation in cancer treatment, although some patients do recover and therefore benefit from radiation, this comes at a tremendous cost to their bodies. You could argue that the person received benefit, but not that the radiation did not harm them.
