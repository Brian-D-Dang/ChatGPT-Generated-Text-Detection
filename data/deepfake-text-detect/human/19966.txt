I am currently seeking psychological help regarding a depression that I may have been fighting with for a very long time (I recently realized that I had had suicidal ideations before I even knew what suicide was). While I do understand that a large part of depression coincides with a chemical imbalance in brain chemistry, I feel like it wouldn't be "organically getting better," like it would be artificial "normal."
