Jimmy D with Starz Entertainment did a fantastic job providing us DJ services for our wedding and reception. Jimmy D has a great and well-deserved reputation in the DJ community. We are lucky we were able to hire him to DJ our wedding and reception. He has many years of experience and it shows. He was energetic and super professional in every aspect of the planning and execution of our wedding and reception. He answered our emails immediately and met with us several times before the wedding to make sure we had everything set up the way we wanted. He spent hours before and after, setting up to make sure the lighting and sound was the best it could be. He had great suggestions for songs and activities and helped make our wedding and reception absolutely perfect. It was seamless, and everyone had a great time! We highly, highly, recommend Jimmy D and Starz Entertainment for DJ services!
