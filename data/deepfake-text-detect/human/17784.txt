This is not about waxing poetic about non-responses to the messages I send out so please do not take it that way. The basis of starting a conversation with anyone in the history of conversations is a greeting. For the life of me I cannot understand why some women use this as a measurement of assumption on how boring the male is. It really stumps me. Why can't the first message be a simple hello? And so you'll hear women all over the rOkCupid sub saying that they ignore the messages will simple greetings, and read the ones where it is 'apparent the man is trying.' To me this sounds as if this is another hoop someone has to jump through just to even talk to the woman. How is this not an entitled way of thinking? This is par for course on the expectations of a dancing monkey. Edit: Did my best to argue reasonably. Did my best to read most of the responses in here. Did my best as far expecting rchangemyview to be different from other subs. Thanks for unreasonably down voting everything I have said in here. Edit2: I am done responding since you guys cannot quit abusing reddit. I am not going to keep trying to have conversations with you when you're down voting me on everything I'm saying, no matter what I say. Edit3: For the record, none of you changed my mind because the majority of you are personally attacking me without reading any of my responses in the thread. It seems like the majority of you think I am whining about not getting responses when that isn't the problem at all. I have never had a problem with sending or receiving messages, and my dating life is actually quite nice. This was always only about genial greetings suddenly not being enough, not being enough of a complicated hoop to jump through. It is obvious that rchangemyview uses down voting to show disagreement, and that is a travesty because I think the general idea of this sub to be absolutely wonderful in so far as I do everything I can to keep myself out of an echo chamber.
