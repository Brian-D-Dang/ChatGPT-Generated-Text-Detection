It varies. Television for example has no way to know how many people view the ad exactly so they charge for running the ad a set number of times. But they do have some idea of when the peak viewing times are so ads during that period are priced higher. Websites and apps are different in that they can know how many times they are viewed which means they can charge per "impression.,'Depends. For websites and apps, there are major companies (the biggest one is Google) that handle it all. The advertiser pays Google so much for each time their ad is displayed or clicked (they get to choose). Google gets the money, apart from a small amount that goes to the developer of the app or website that showed the ad. In the case of TV, all the stations have big ad sales departments. A company shoots an ad, and then their "media buyers" basically negotiate with TV stations as to how much they want in order to show it. The price will depend on the number of slots, time of day, the programme it's shown during, etc. Same with radio stations and print newspapersmagazines, pretty much. It's also all quite proactive. Advertisers will get phone calls all the time from TV stations, magazines, whatever, trying to sell them a slot. One downside of advertising in a magazine, for example, is that you will then be plagued forever more with calls from every other competing magazine wanting you to run your ad in their publication.
