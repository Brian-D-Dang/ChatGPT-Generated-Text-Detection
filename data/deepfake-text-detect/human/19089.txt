So I've been debating a few friends lately about the maximum reasonable timeframe for responding to texts. In my opinion, unless there is some sort of emergency, or particularly time-sensitive subject matter (making short term plans, for example), then 24 hours is a perfectly acceptable amount of time to wait for a response to a text. Before text messaging became so common, no one ever batted an eye about waiting 24 hours for a response to a telephone message or an email, so why should texting be treated any differently? After all, it's not as if a text message travels any faster than a phone message or an email. Just because one person has the immediate opportunity to send a text does not mean that the person on the receiving end has the same opportunity to respond. The sender should always assume that the receiver could be otherwise occupied, and that it may take them a full day (or possibly longer) to find a convenient time to read and respond to their message. And that is the key point: when you send a text (that is not particularly time-sensitive), you should be prepared to wait for the receiver to find a convenient time respond. Anything else is simply rude and entitled behavior. CMV.
