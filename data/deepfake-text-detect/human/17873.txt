I understand this might be suited to a different subreddit, and that it's a bit unconventional for a post here, but I thought I'd try here first. No idea what the response will be to this. I've become dissatisfied with the model glorified by the pornsex industry that paints women as hairless, and to me it seems odd to sleep withgo down on a lady who is bare down there. This has not always been the case, there were times when it excited me (as in when I was in my late teens and newish to sex), but pubic hair simply seems like the natural way of things, and I prefer a woman who trims over one who shaves. These days, I'm more attracted to a woman who doesn't even trim over one who waxes or shaves entirely. Bare vaginas just look unnatural to me, and it has evolved into an actual turn off to get into bed with a partner who has one. Perhaps it's a disillusionment with the disconnect between the real women I interact with (wink, wink, nudge nudge, know what I mean, know what I mean?) and the prevailing (male-dominated) sex industry's image of "perfection," but I find myself labeled as a bush "fetishist" by many men I bring this up to. I don't regard this as a fetish (I have a few real ones, I know what a fetish is), simply as a realistic view of sex and the female body, and I find myself actively turned off recently by images, videos or depictions of entirely nude vaginas. Please, change my view - in your opinion, am I simply talking to the wrong people about this, perusing the wrong sites, looking at the issue in too much blackwhite, or am I actually a bush fetishist?
