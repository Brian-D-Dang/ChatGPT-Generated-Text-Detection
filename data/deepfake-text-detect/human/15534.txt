My husband and I hosted a large dinner for family and friends (about 40 people) at Stac Polly on Dublin Street on a Friday night with a set menu from their Autumn 2014 selections. The food was stunning, as always, and at a very reasonable price. The starter of Baked filo pastry parcels of finest haggis, sweet plum and red wine sauce was a real crowd-pleaser (every plate was perfect) and eloquently introduced the Roasted rump of Borders lamb with mustard and herb crust, aubergine and red onion tart tatin, star anise carrots, fine beans and game jus. Everyone who ordered the Vanilla pod creme brulee underlain by summer fruit compote all agreed they could have eaten a gallon on it! I cannot emphasis strongly enough the quality of food and cooking at Stac Polly. I have enjoyed Scottish fine dining in a number of highly acclaimed restaurants in Edinburgh but not one outstrips a meal at Stac Polly. The attentive and relaxed service in a warm and understated atmosphere results in an experience reminiscent of a good meal and excellent company in the home of close friends with the benefit of someone else clearing the table:) I can't wait to go back!
