Well, one reviewer said that if I'm used to dining on NY or SF, this place won't blow my mind. Maybe they didn't eat what we did. Granted, two of the four things we ordered were specials: a lovely capon rillette appetizer, and a top sirloin (slow cooked in a sealed bag with herbs for four hours, and it shows!) entree. That appetizer was incredible, the top sirloin was delectable and from Australia, just like my date, and the salmon I ordered absolutely melted in my mouth, just like my d.... err.... anyway! My warm goat cheese salad was amazing with plenty, if not too much cracked pepper on top. I asked our waiter to bring lots of pepper, and being a total character from Chicago, he more than obliged. I think he went a little overboard, yet otherwise, he was a really fantastic waiter, and I did find it hilarious, if not just a touch too spicy. Delicious though! He also chose us a very lovely wine to go with our meal, was a great conversationalist, and brought us tiny cookies from their pastry chef, who is diabetic, just like my date! No kidding. Oh, and did I mention that the menu comes wrapped around your napkin, and they will fold your napkin for you if they come by when you've momentarily left the table? They are SO attentive: truly excellent service. Overall, a lovely dining experience, and I look forward to checking out the others here in CA once I finally drag my classy butt up to the wine country.
