Tickets issued by police for parking and speeding violations (hereafter referred to as "tickets are, in my view, primarily for generating money for the state. People claim that they're to prevent speeding. There is nothing preventing the establishment of a system of points where every time you're pulled over for speeding, you get assigned a number of points on your license. After a certain threshold, you lose your license for a week, then a month, then a year, then permanently. This serves the exact same function that the current ticket system supposedly does without the extortion aspect of the fines associated with them. EDIT: People seem to keep hitting the "points aren't a deterrent" idea but it frankly doesn't matter; if someone is deterred by the system then it works, if they aren't then they'll swiftly run up their point total and have their license taken away and be off the road where they don't endanger others with their driving.
