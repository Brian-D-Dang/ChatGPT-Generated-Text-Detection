Spotify Technology might be looking at acquiring Ringer, a sports and pop-culture startup. Ringer is involved in the podcast business, like the other four startups that Spotify bought in 2019. It was founded by Bill Simmons, who launched the outlet after ESPN fired him as a commentator. The startup already works with Spotify to produce podcast content. Its podcasting business is profitable, which might help provide an instant boost to Spotify's financials. Spotify made a loss of 86 million in 2018, but it turned a profit of about 25 million for the first nine months of 2019.
