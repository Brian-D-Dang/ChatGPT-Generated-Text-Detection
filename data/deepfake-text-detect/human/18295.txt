Edit: RIP Inbox 283 comments, wtf Also, yes I got the Adam and Eve thing wrong, I admit I fucked up, I'm not gonna change the original body of text. The Christian God of the bible (I will just refer to him as God for my laziness) is a horrible creature. He has killed the entire population of the world. He killed Adam and Eve for eating fruit that would give them knowledge and he is generally a horrible person. Forgetting the bible let's look at things that happen everyday. Ebola, death, murders, disease, wars, birth defects, bullying, violent protests. The list goes on of horrible things that happen everyday. Surely an all powerful, omnipotent God like the one from the bible could stop these things? If he can, but doesn't want to, he should not be worshiped for he is a horrible thing, he let's 5 years olds with cancer die on a daily basis because he can't be bothered. Does he want to but can't? Then he shouldn't be worshiped as a God! My second point should be disregarded as the bible says he is an omnipotent and all powerful God (or at least leans towards the fact that he is.) While I agree that many people see God as all loving and the bible is only a metaphor I disagree. The bible is what the bible says. You can't pick and choose which bits are correct and which bits are wrong. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
