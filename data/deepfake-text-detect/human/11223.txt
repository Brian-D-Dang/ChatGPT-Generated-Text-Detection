Luna allows developers to design, prototype, develop, and refactor any application by linking visual elements together. Developers are able to collaborate with a team, interactively fine-tune parameters, inspect the results, and visually profile performance in real-time. This repository contains the code for the compiler core. A link to the full visual Luna Studio repository is available.
