I've always heard it said that the rationalization for having a higher drinking age was to protect younger people from making poor decisiongetting hurt. It seems pretty laughable that joining the military could be considered a less "impactful" decision than the decisions associated with drinking. On the other side of things, I also think it's harmful for the military as well. A "kid" who's just 18 doesn't really make for a good soldier, particularly due to the nature of "war" we are currently in.
