First, I'd like to point out that I'm well aware of the history of blackface, and the older utilization of it to offensively portray some awful stereotype of black people is racist. However, I don't think that has any bearing on blackface today. What if an actor of another race simply wanted to portray a black character, and so they darkened the color of their skin to make their appearance more accurate? There could be absolutely no mocking of race going on, and people will still shout "racism!" For example, I know a white girl who tried to do an impression of Michelle Obama. She dressed up in blackface and made jokes about healthy eating and vegetables and whatnot. She got torn apart on social media for being racist. Although I can see how this impression is in bad taste, I cannot see how it is racist. She only made fun of Michelle Obama's campaigning, and she never once made fun of her race at all. And yet, it was still considered racist.
