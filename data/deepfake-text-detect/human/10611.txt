Let's imagine you have some bacteria that split once per hour. You start with 1 million bacteria, then an hour later you have 2 million, then an hour later it's 4 million, then 8 million, then 16 million, and so on. You write out a formula for how much bacteria there is after N hours, and you get 1,000,000 2N (note that 20 is 1, so this formula is just fine). When you look at this population you might ask "how fast is the population growing?" Well, over the first hour it grew by 1 million bacteria so you might say that it's growing at 1 million bacteria per hour, but if you counted every 30 minutes you'd find that there's only about 1.4 million after 30 minutes but after a full hour there's 2 million, so maybe you say that the population is growing at about (400,000 bacteria) (30 minutes) 800,000 bacteria per hour for the first half hour, then 1,200,000 bacteria per hour for the second half hour. You could keep on looking at the growth over a shorter and shorter period of time and you'd get a more and more accurate measurement of the bacterial growth per hour. What you'd notice is that the number of bacteria added to the population per hour is always a constant multiple of the population: when the population is 1 million the growth rate is 693,147hr. When the population is 10 million it's 6,931,472hr, and so on. There's always that constant ratio of.693147..... between the growth rate and the number of bacteria there are. Next we look at another population of bacteria that split a little faster. They triple their population each hour, so you start with 1 million bacteria, then an hour later you have 3 million, then 9 million, and so on. You come up with a formula for this population and it's 1,000,000 3 (N). Again you look at how fast the population is growing and again you find that there's this constant ratio between the number of bacteria you add per hour (as measured over a very very short period of time) and the number of bacteria there are. This time, though, the ratio is different: it's 1.0986.... At this point you ask "How fast does the bacteria have to grow to make that ratio be 1?" We've seen that doubling in an hour is too low, while tripling in an hour is a bit too high. We could guess a few more numbers and home in on the answer: 2.71828...., or e. If we had a population of bacteria that had an equation of 1,000,000 eN then at any instant you're adding more bacteria at a rate exactly equal to the population (i.e. when you have 1,200,000 bacteria you're adding them at 1,200,000hr). This idea is the fundamental definition of what e is. In calculus we call this idea of "rate of change, as measured over an incredibly short period of time" a derivative, and the derivative of ex is e (x). The constant e is the only number for which that can be true; for any other number you wind up with those constants. You asked about logarithms, but logarithms are just backwards exponentiation. They confuse people because they're written as a word, but they should be no more confusing than learning that subtraction undoes addition or that division undoes multiplication. If you see that 1 2 3 then you should be able to work out that 3 - 2 1. Similarly, if you see that 3 4 12 then you should be able to work out that 12 4 3. With logarithms it's the same but written more confusingly: if 34 81 then log3 (81) 4. When you deal with exponential growth you often deal a lot with e as the base, since it has that property I mentioned earlier of having a rate of change equal to itself. You also frequently have to deal with undoing the exponentiation if you want to find the exponent and just know the base and the answer, hence bringing in logarithms. These two things coincide often enough that it's efficient to just have shorthand for "do the reverse of e (a) b" so we write ln (b) a.
