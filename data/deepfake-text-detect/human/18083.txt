So this CMV is actually two parts: 1. The superhero genre is such an albatross around comic books necks. I understand why it exists, as it's still the top seller in the medium, but it really drags down better comics that no one will read because they'll associate them with superheros. Stuff like Transmetropolitan and Sand Man shouldn't be like niche books in a sea of super heroes, but it's main attraction. 2. Superheroes in every way are just completely unrealistic. I don't mean the powers, I mean the very foundational reality behind them. Do you know who dresses up in costumes and go out looking for justice? Crazy people, vigilantes, and terrorists like the Klu Klux Klan. Just the very foundational idea that someone discovers one day they have powers and then puts on a costume and looks for crime is just ridiculous. When people encounter weird shit they go to the government, not only out of fear, but more importantly out of liability. Fundamentally speaking Superheroes would not be allowed to exist full-stop. America is a nation state. The definition of a state is having a monopoly on violence. Of course there's crime, but there's no other legitimate source of violence other than a government sanctioned on. If a batman or punisher existed it wouldn't be like three guys in a secret agency out to get them. It would literally unite the entire military industrial complex in a hunt of epic proportions. Nation states absolutely do like it when their authority is threatened. Hell, maybe super-heroes can exist in a lawless place like Somalia. Maybe pirates are the real heroes. Finally, because superheroes are so ridiculous in concept, I find meta-superhero comics like Powers or Watchmen even dumber. It's like trying to satirize and analyze a completely pointless strawman.
