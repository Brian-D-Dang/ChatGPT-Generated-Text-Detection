The implementation of Judicial Review from the Marbury v. Madison case from the precedent of the Judiciary Act of 1789 allows for the Supreme court to be to judge over the legislative branch and executive branch of government. Furthermore, Fletcher v. Peck allows for the overturing of state laws in the Supreme Court, which changed the balance of state versus federal government power in favor of the federal government. In McCulloch v. Maryland, the supreme Court cited the "necessary and proper" or elastic clause in the constitution to implement laws not explicitly stated in the text. (In this case being the Second Bank of the United States and the legality of a state entity taxing the federal bank.) Cohens v. Virginia allowes for the Supreme Court to superceede state bank's ruling on criminal charges. Finally, although some may argue that the court is checked by the circumstances by which Justices reach the position- recommendation by the president and approval by the senate, but once inside the court, they have life tenure. [Even the impeachment of Justices accused of public drunkeness and insanity have not been sucessfully carried out.] Ultimately, this means that: 1. The Supreme Court can judge legality of the actions of the Legislative and Executive brantches of government. 2. The Supreme Court rules over the state courts. 3. The Supreme Court can create laws that are "Necessary and Proper" 4. Criminals otherwise convicted by state courts can be retrialed with the Supreme Court. 5. Life tenure is nearly garenteed as no justice have been impeached in US History.
