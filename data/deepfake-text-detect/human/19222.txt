I lived in Norway for the past 3.5 years, and one of the first things I noticed is how streamlined the banking industry is. We go out for drinks and one friend pays for it all? We can just send him our tab from our phone or through the bank website on our computer. No fees, and it shows up relatively instantly. Bills? You get a bill and a unique identifier which is used to pay the bill from your account, as default. Same ease and same process. I bet most people here have wondered, in their adolescent innocence, why can't I send money to another person easily with just their bank account number? I believe we should, and it's as easy as making a law that requires banks to provide this service to us. Over a few years, it would become streamlined and we would wonder why we never did this before.
