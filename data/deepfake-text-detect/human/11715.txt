Elon Musk has revealed that he has a design for a submarine car, like the one from the James Bond movie 'The Spy Who Loved Me'. As a child, Musk was awed by the scene where a 1976 Lotus Esprit drove off a pier and transformed into a submarine with the touch of a button. While designing such a vehicle is difficult, Musk claims that it is not impossible. He purchased a 1976 Lotus Esprit at an auction in London back in 2013 for around 997,000. While it might be fun to design and produce such a car, Musk admits that the market for this kind of vehicle would be very small.
