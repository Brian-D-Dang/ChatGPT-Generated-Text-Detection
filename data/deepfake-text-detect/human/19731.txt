As the title says, I believe drugs should be legalized. As it is your job to change my view, I will not go into too much detail as to why I believe in legalizing drugs, but I will merely say that I believe it will decrease crime, make addicts healthier and give them a better chance at breaking their vicious circle and finally that I believe it is the right of every human being to consume what her or she wants.
