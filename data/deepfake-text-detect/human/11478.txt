Apple has released iOS 12, which features significant performance improvements over iOS 11 (it is 40 faster for launching apps and up to 70 faster for launching the camera). It has a new Screen Time feature, which tells you exactly how much time you spend on your phone or tablet, and which apps you're spending it on. Unlike iOS 11, it groups notifications together by app instead of sending floods of notifications from any one app. The iBooks, Apple News, Stocks, and Voice Memos apps have all been redesigned, and the Messages app now has Memojis (custom animated Animoji avatars). Maybe the most exciting part is ARKit 2, which will allow developers to build AR experiences that are shared by multiple users.
