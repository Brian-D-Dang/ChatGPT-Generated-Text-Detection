[A manned mission to Mars is estimated to cost a minimum of 100 billion dollars.] The entire curiosity rover project cost 2.5 billion dollars, and was the most expensive rover ever built. The whole Rosetta Mission only cost 1 billion dollars. In terms of the science gained, there is no advantage to sending humans into space over robots. NASA has a finite budget. So sending astronauts to Mars is not only unproductive, but it will actively hinder our space program by siphoning funds from actual productive missions. Whenever proponents talk about sending humans to Mars, they insist it's going to be an inspiration for a new generation of scientists and engineers. Of course I don't speak for everyone, but a feel good mission with little scientific merit and an astronomical cost don't inspire me at all. As a young engineer, I'd rather see projects being funded that actually contribute to our knowledge of the universe. Doing things simply because "we can" is not good enough when the price is this high. The most ridiculous point I see about this is that establishing a colony is a necessary safeguard against the extinction of humanity, in case the earth one day becomes uninhabitable. I've never seen anyone who proposes this predict the amount of time it will take before a colony on mars becomes self-sufficient (which it has to be, or else there is no point). In the coming decades advances in technology will probably make this feasible, so there is no point to spending money on it now. We are going to be in a completely different era technologically in 100 years, and putting humans on Mars then is going to significantly easier. Doing this mission now is like blowing an inheritance on a sports car instead of going to medical school. We will most likely have more than enough resources to do this in the future, so why bother with it now?
