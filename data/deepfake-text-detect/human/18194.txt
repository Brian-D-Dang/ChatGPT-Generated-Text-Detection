This afternoon I went to the grocery store to pick up a few things for dinner. The song playing when I walked in was a Christmas song with an overtly religious theme about worshiping the Christkind. As an atheist, I was annoyed and offended that they would turn a grocery store into a church. I think stores that aren't catering specifically to a religious audience should not play songs with such overtly religious themes since it sends a message of disregard for others' religious beliefs or non-beliefs, something a little more personal than merely disliking a store's usual selection of ambient music. I bet many Christians would feel offended if they walked into a supermarket with Islamic hymns playing or perhaps Jewish carols too. They'd certainly be offended by Satanic verses or Wiccan and neo-pagan songs. I see this as another example of the Christian majority showing it's insensitivity towards minority views. If you want to sing about Jesus, go to a church. Don't feel that everywhere you go has to be playing Christian-themed music from November to January.
