I'm not suggesting that rape victims are ever totally at fault, but if a girl gets wasted at a party in a skimpy outfit and hasn'tisn't making any effort to protect herself, a small percentage of the blame can be placed on her for being irresponsible. If a guy were to run around Detroit screaming "I hate niggers" and got killed because of it, would saying "he bears some of the responsibility" be considered victim blaming? If someone goes into saudi arabia and starts burning the Qur'an and is murdered because of it, would asking "what the fuck was he thinking?" be considered victim blaming? Guys should stop raping women, yes. We should teach our children not to rape, yes. But the same can be said about murder. Am I crazy? I'm honestly afraid to express this view in real life because people seem so quick to judge, when all I want is to have a discussion about it.
