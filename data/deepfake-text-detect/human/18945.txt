Personally I think that the whole idea of virginity wrong because with this supposed 'virginity' comes this image of purity and being good, and if you've lost your virginity before a certain time (which is different in different culturesgroups of people) you're looked down on as being dirty, unclean or just wrong. And on the flipside of this if you haven't lost your virginity by a certain age you can be looked down on as well. Also the phrase 'losing your virginity' suggests that you're suddenly not whole or pure after it has happened. This can be rather harmful to people as it can cause bullying due to being young and having lost it, or old and not having lost it. Another reason I think it should be changed is that in some areas it is very grey. I've never heard a clear cut definition that covers the topic properly. If the definition for women losing their virginity is when their hymen is broken, what about people where it breaks due to something other than sex (I've heard that this can happen to athletes or dancers and various other groups of people)? And how do we define something similar for men? So then we say the definition is the first time a woman is penetrated by a man? What if someone is forced into sex against their will? Are they still a virgin? And what about a woman in a same sex relationship? If she has sexual experiences with her partner, but her hymen is never broken and she is never penetrated is she still a virgin? And if a man in a same sex relationship is penetrated by his partner but he hasn't penetrated anyone is he still a virgin? There are lots of different situations that are left out by this concept of viriginity. My suggestion is that we change this concept to the idea of having a sexual debut. The first time you willingly enter a sexual experience with another person you have this debut, and that's it.
