(For the purpose of this I am discounting Eskimos) I am of the belief that while the Native Americans are people just like any other (And should thus be treated with the respect and dignity beholden to any other person), their accomplishments are largely unimpressive and their culture representative of them having not developed metallurgy more than some kind of inherent specialness. I am continually told that their ability to adapt was impressive, but I compare it to the people of almost any other continent and I'm left sorely underwhelmed. The Native Americans largely lived in areas perfectly suited for human life, with plenty of wildlife and resources at their disposal. Meanwhile the Sami people live in frozen Scandinavia and did just as well as most American Natives, the Egyptians lived in a desert with sparse areas of fertile land and built some of the greatest monuments the world has ever known. I am told of how much they lived in harmony with nature, taking only what they needed, but then I read up on how they actually hunted buffalo prior to the European introduction of horses and I wonder exactly what they're talking about. I am told of their proud warriors, and can't help but notice they lost. I hear of their spirituality and wonder what people doesn't have spirituality. Now, I have nothing against native Americans. As I've said they're people just like everyone else, and I sincerely hope no one takes this as me wishing to deny natives their culture or history. I, as an outsider, just remain unimpressed.
