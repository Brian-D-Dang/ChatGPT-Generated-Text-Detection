At one point while at Bacchanal, sometime after eating a plate overflowing with at least a pound of crab legs and before taking on a final slice of cheesecake (one of the 5 desserts I ravaged), it dawned on me: Oh god. I'm like one of the citizens of the Capital in the Hunger Games. What have I become?! I quickly parried that thought however; as much as I want to imagine myself in the vein of a half-starved (and ruggedly handsome) hero of District 12, sometimes...it's nice to indulge. And at Bacchanal, indulge you will. From the get-go, you know you are going to try to cram as much food as humanly possible into your stomach to try and claw back some of the steep entry price (50). As a long distance runner with seemingly hollow legs who burns thousands of calories a workout, I think I ended up okay at Bacchanal, maybe eating 30 or so dollars worth of food at its retail price. I can live with that. Beyond calculations of value (which are almost meaningless in Vegas, which seems to be fueled on the wispy fumes of luxury itself), the fare is par for the course. Everything I ate was of high quality and tasty. One thing I didn't like so much was the blaring Euro-hip music. I think they blast it so you'll eat and leave more quickly, but...it was annoying not to be able to have conversations with the people I went with. Some things had an extra fine-tuned and endearing touch though, like the fish and chips in little metal frying crates or the Chinese dumplings in individual bamboo baskets (or maybe I'm easily impressed). Either way, those small details made the experience more than just a ridiculous gut-stuffing smorgasbord.
