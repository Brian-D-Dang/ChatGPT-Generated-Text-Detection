Well, frankly because certain people make billions on preventing the distribution of pot. Law enforcement, prisons, the DEA, oh not even to mention all the alcohol companies that make more money because it's illegal. Would it be difficult to have similar rules to alcohol? NO. With more and more people finding it acceptable and not as harmful as alcohol or certain prescription drugs, I see the prohibition ending soon.
