Attacks and abuse happen. Recently, a friend witnessed an off-leash Rottweiler snatch-up a chihuahua, kill it, and walk back to its (bewildered) owner with a bloody mouth and a wagging tailignorant that it had done anything wrong. Now there is a dead pet and a likely-soon-to-be-euthanized 'aggressive' dog simply because its owner was clueless with their animal. Higher-mammals have been kept as pets for centuries, and are often praised for their intelligence. It is precisely this level of intelligence that drives my belief that compulsory licensing is necessary. In light of what science has informed us about higher-mammal intellect and the emotional capacity that comes with it, if we wish to consider ourselves a moral society (which i think we hardly are but could certainly strive for) then it would seem to follow that licensing and requirements for that license (classes and such) could put us on a path that decreases animal abuse, property damage, and the other issues contained in the custodianship of certain pets. Change my view.
