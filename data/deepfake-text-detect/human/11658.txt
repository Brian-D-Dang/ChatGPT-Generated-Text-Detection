The plant-based meat industry is now worth 800 million and accounts for two percent of packaged meat sales. Both Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods have started to expand their product ranges. Impossible Foods plans to work with Wow Bao, a Chicago-founded chain of Asian restaurants, to produce a steamed dumpling. The aim is to eventually move into the Asian market, which is emerging as the fastest-growing market for plant-based meat alternatives. Impossible Foods has also started the development of a fish alternative and it aims to recreate every animal-based product by 2035. Beyond Meat has teamed up with Subway to produce the Beyond Meatball Marinara sub, which will be available in 685 restaurants in the United States and Canada for a limited time from September.
