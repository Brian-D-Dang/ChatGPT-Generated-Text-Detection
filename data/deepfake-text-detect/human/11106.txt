What world issues are you referring to? There's a little over 1,500 billionaires in the world, so that would be a little over 1.5 billion dollars, which is not a lot of money, the U.S. federal budget is over 3.5 trillion dollars.," "Even if there were a thousand billionaires, that's a billion dollars. The U.S. government spends that in two hours. Do you think the U.S. government would cure the world's problems if it had an extra two hours worth of money per year?," "It's not really the money that is the problem, oddly enough. I'll toss a WAG out there and say that most billionaires probably do donate a million or more to various charities. Instead, it can be difficult to apply the leverage that money offers against a lot of the world's problems. Check out the Gates Foundation sometime. They gave out a little over 3 billion in 2013, and their programs are some of the most highly targeted and organized charitable efforts out there. And they have made some real progress in those areas. But still, despite the money they've poured into, say, eradicating malaria over twelve years, they've only managed to reduce malaria deaths by about half. Nothing wrong with that, it's terrific work and good progress. Still, that represents 2 billion and more than a decade of effort. It's not just money holding up the show. A lot of the issues are cultural, political, or environmental and you can't just plunk a million down on the counter and buy those changes. A huge part of what foundations like that do is simply pay people to sit around and figure out how to effectively spend the money they have to get the changes they want. It's not a no-brainer at all.,Where the fuck do you get these numbers from?
