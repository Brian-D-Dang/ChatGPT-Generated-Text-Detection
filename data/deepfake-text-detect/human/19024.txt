What I mean is when people are given a free pass for something because it is 'part of their religion,' when somebody else with the same beliefs and practices would get more criticism. For example, many people are vegetarian and vegan for moral reasons. They believe that animals deserve more rights than they are given. I see people sometimes expressing the view that you shouldn't be expected to cater to vegetarians or vegans, unless it's a health restriction... or a part of their religion. Why is the religious person given more respect for their dietary choices? To be clear, I'm not talking about law at all, I'm talking about being polite and respectful. Hello, users of CMV!
