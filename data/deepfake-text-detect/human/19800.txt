The US republic was founded on the notion of natural rights that all human beings are "endowed by their creator" with certain rights, and these rights are detailed in the first legal documents with some specificity. The trouble I have is that I don't see how they are "real." It's certainly nicely worded, and I like those particular rights, but I don't understand how they're justified. Natural rights seem both unfalsifiable and unverifiable. What does it mean for something to be a "natural right"? And, whether or not something is, what difference does it make? It seems to me to be nothing more than a rhetorical device to draw support for the independence movement, which itself appears to be an overreaction to relatively modest taxes as compared to those in Britain itself, part of which was necessary for funding the military defense of the colonies. If I declare something to be a natural right, how is my declaration to be judged? And if they are endowed by a creator, say the Judaic deity, but those rights do not appear in the scripture, then on what basis are they?
