In most places in the US, there's not a lot of competition between ISPs in the consumer market. With net neutrality gone, those few ISPs, as the ones controlling the wires, would be able to indirectly dictate many aspects of the media and content we see on the internet. They would most likely favor the content providers they have deals with and slow down (or even block) those that are not said providers. Also, big companies will be able to buy up massive amounts of bandwidth, making creating new media intensive startups, like a new Twitch or imgur, very difficult. I just don't see how the new rules would benefit consumers in this oligarchic market. It might make sense if there were more competition between ISPs, but not in our current reality.
