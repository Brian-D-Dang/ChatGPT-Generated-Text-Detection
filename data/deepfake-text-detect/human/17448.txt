What a friend said recently has been really bugging me. That if they were married to someone, and that person had a trauma to their brain that caused them to switch personalities, be more aggressive, whatever, they would leave them without a second thought, because it's not longer the person they married. This has rocked me quite hard, and now I'm freaking out about any relationship or friendship whatsoever not being "real," whatever that used to mean to me. Please change my view, help me understand why relationships are real and do matter!
