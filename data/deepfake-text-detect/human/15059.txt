This was formerly Risque which was the WORST vegas club ever, so it was a relief to hear it was closed down and reopened as a new club. With any NEW vegas club, my expectations of it are high, but major FAIL! I wasn't impressed by the venue and the crowd sucks!!!! my girlfriends and I were there 20 minutes max and left to go to Tao.
