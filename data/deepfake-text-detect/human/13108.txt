I run my hands down your soft from and slowly give you a squeeze. I can feel the flex in your soft frame as I hold you close and put your jacket on, then hide you beneath mine. No one will see you because you are mine and mine alone. I whisk you out of the hollowed halls and back up to my apartment, gripping you as I cross the threshold to my home. I shut the door behind, lock it and lean against it. I feel your weight on my chest. I pull you out and rip your jacket off and ravage you with my eyes. I am shaking, I'm not sure if its because of fear or excitement, but I hope I just don't finish too quickly. I want to savor this moment. I slowly lift my hand, and ever so softly touch you. Biting my lip, and with no hesitation, I pick you up and whisk you away and rush to my bedroom, diving under the covers. I lay you on my pillow, and slowly open my mouth and, "Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone."
