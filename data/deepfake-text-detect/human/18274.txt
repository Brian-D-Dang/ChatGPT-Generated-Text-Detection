By civil marriage, I mean a legal union that is recognized by the government and which confers benefits of some kind. For purposes of this submission I am referring to the US, although examples from other countries are fine. I believe that people have a right to be in a relationship (and have sex) with whomever they please. However, I believe that you have no inherent right to have your relationship recognized by the government or to have any of the benefits conferred. That said, the government must still have a rational basis for differentiating between groups. To explain further: I think marriage is less like free speech and more like social security. In the first case, it is a absolute right granted to everyone without exception, in the other, it is a set of benefits which the government only chooses to extend to a particular group (old people as opposed to young, in this case.) The government would not be violating anyone's rights if they chose to only marry a specific set of people, like only straight couples, or only "fertile" couples, or only people who had not been previously married, for example. These distinctions should still have to be legally defensible. Note: This isn't about gay or multiple marriage specifically, but the implication is that the government wouldn't be violating the rights of those people by refusing to marry them. Marrying them might still be a good idea, but it isn't something that they are owed. Convince me otherwise.
