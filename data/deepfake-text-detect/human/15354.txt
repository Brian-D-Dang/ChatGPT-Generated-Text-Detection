Ridiculously amazing show!!!! Hubby and I were completely astonished! Sat in the premium seats (the middle between splash zone and VIP) section A, H 1516. Considered the VIP section but after seeing the seats, don't think they're really worth it...they seat further back but the seats are rather lush. Guess it really boils down to whether or not you really want the champagne! Saw some people in the splash zone move up to the'premium seats' shortly after the first gig - I'd pay the extra 30 to not sit in the splash zone...but if you can choose seats in the 2nd row up I guess its good savings? I prefer Orchestra like seats so H did us just fine. Don't look up any videos on this! It's best to go in with no expectations...get ready to be blown away!!:)
