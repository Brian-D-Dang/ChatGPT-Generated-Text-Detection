Lookin for good food after a movie at Epicenter on a Sunday night. The wings were meaty and tasty. Bigger than average. I got an order of 16 and could only eat 10 with a side salad. Got 2 flavors. Lime and garlic. Both were good. Service at the bar was poor. Had 2 servers and was very slow. I had to ask for refills and service. Dessert was terrible. I had brownie alamode. The ice cream was crystallized ice milk. Horrible. Would not return (
