They are very long exposures. The camera lens (shutter) is held open for many seconds. If the vehicle is zooming by, they actually pivot the vehicle while the shutter is open, to keep the shot steady.','As ConcisePirate said, it is a long exposure. If you own an amateur telescope and you attach a camera to it you could take cool photos too but you would need to make really long exposures (from 5 to 15 minutes) to get a clear image.','Sensitive cameras, longer exposures, and lack of contrast. Even at the distance of Pluto, the sun is still brighter than the full moon, and you can read by the full moon. The one thing that helps dim things look dim on earth is exposure to a slightly brighter light. Your eyes adjust to the brightest light source and have trouble seeing dimmer things. But if you go outside far away from city lights and let your eyes full adapt, you can see pretty well by moonlight, and even by starlight. Similarly, if Pluto or Juno is the brightest thing the camera is looking at, it will have an easier time adapting to its light level.
