The short answer: Altruism, sympathy, affection and company. It's the same reasons for why humans rear pets, and these are arguably evidenced in intelligent animals as well such as mammals. (For bugs and less-intelligent creatures they do so too but more often for parasitic and symbiotic value.) The gorilla Koko (of ape language fame) was known to keep kittens and parrots as pets. When one of her kittens escaped one day and got run over by a passing car, Koko signed words of sadness and wept over the loss, corroborating the theory that smart mammals can and do express such "human" emotions to a degree.
