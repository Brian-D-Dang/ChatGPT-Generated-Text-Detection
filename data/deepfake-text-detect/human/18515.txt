My doctor has indicated that throughout her reading of literature concerning the topic at hand, she is also under the same impression. I hold this view due to a medial knowledge of marijuana's long term effects on the brain based on the occassional reading of literature that holds the same view. Edit: i would love to read sourced academic material to support responses. Thanks!
