Unfortunately this question cannot be explained like you are five because five year olds are not usually heartbroken. Denial plays a huge factor, and also memories with the person if you did manage to have a relationship with them. It's hard to get away from something you got used to.,Because it is a type of loss, and we are evolutionarily wired to not want loss. Loss is detrimental to survival.
