Waymo just announced that it hit 10 million miles in real world testing of its self-driving cars. However, the company also uses a simulator to drive 10 million test miles per day, for situations where it would be too dangerous to do real world testing (for example, in the simulator they can test their software in scenarios where pedestrians suddenly jump out at the car). To explore more corner cases, Waymo uses "fuzzing" a technique where they rerun scenarios but add random variations each time, to see if these variations cause things to break or cars to crash. The company also has 400 people in Phoenix, Arizona using completely driverless taxis for their daily drives.
