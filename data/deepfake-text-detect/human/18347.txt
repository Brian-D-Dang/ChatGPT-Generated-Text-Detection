In just about every way, I think opera singers are far superior. Talent, accomplishment, skill etc. Opera singers are the professors and pop singers are the kindergarten teachers. The demands in vocal skill are far higher in opera. Opera is focused on live performance, with far less forgiving standards than a concert. Opera singers have no autotune. Opera singers require far more training than pop (oh you're a teenager with a decent voice? put out an album!) Opera singers have to be able to project, pop singers have sound systems (and often lip sync). Opera singers are required to express a far greater dramatic range. Lucia has to be crazy. Maddalena has to be heartbroken. Queen of the Night (not Whitney Houston) has to be enraged. etc etc. Pop singers are either cheerful or sad. Even the best pop singers could almost certainly not sing any opera up to standards without tons of training, while any opera singer could probably let their hair down and sing a pop song effortlessly.
