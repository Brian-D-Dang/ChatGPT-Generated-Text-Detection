Saltiness is one of the five basic taste sensations. This means that when you add salt to something, you are activating more of the taste buds on your tongue. Because you are now using more of the taste buds on your tongue, you are able to taste more'parts' of your food. I believe there is a video by Alton Brown somewhere explaining the actual science behind this (I'm too lazy to find it).
