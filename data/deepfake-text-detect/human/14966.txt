This place has been a personal family tradition for over 40 years. From the days when you could order their'steak that's not on the menu' for under 9.00, to the raved BBQ Baby Back Ribs, to their NY pizza joint. The food is abundant, inexpensive, and good.'The place for the locals', the payouts are great, and the vibe is kickback from the craziness hoopla from the Strip. Their legendary karaoke room has been around longer than the fad itself. A strong recommend for any tourist who.wants something other than the Strip.
