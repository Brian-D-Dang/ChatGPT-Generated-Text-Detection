I suffer from terrible feelings of depression come Sunday afternoon and I believe the vast majority of the people that have a standard work week feel the same. I don't think that you have to hate your job either. Any field of work involves a kind of self arranged slavery in which you exchange your weekday life for the funds to exist. There may be a lucky few that look forward to the week ahead but they are in the minority. Please change my view because I don't like feeling this way every week. Thanks. Hello, users of CMV!
