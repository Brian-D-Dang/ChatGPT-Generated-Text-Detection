I have been seeing this a lot recently with this lion uproar. Critics say that people shouldn't care about the lion because of all kinds of issues from racism to abortion. I haven't really followed the lion thing, that was just an example. People do this in all sorts of conversations. I find this reasoning completely flawed. Are we only going to care about the most important issue? Before we caretalk about something do we have to make sure there is no issue more important? Also, the conversation about X is already happening. The issue is out in the open and people are passionate about solving it. This is great and a bit rare. We should roll with it when people want to make positive change instead of making them feel bad for being passionate about the wrong thing. People have the capacity to care about more than one issue. Humanity as a whole can work together to solve more than one problem at once. Saying something like this you are trying to derail the argument about X rather than help either argument. Edit This is about society's problems and public conversations rather than individual problems. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
