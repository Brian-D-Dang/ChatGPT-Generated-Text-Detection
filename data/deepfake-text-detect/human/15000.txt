Driving to vegas, you can definitely expect traffic. We had dinner reservations at 7:00 and there is a grace period of only 5 minutes.We ran there and got there at 7:04pm! We asked the hostess if our reservation was still available and she said yes! We were so excited we made it on time, yet after that, we had to wait because I heard the hostess mumbled to another girl that She totally forgot about our group . How do you forget if people made reservations? We had to wait about 5 minutes and was then seated. Our waiters were attentive with our group of 8 people. This is a higher end than Cheesecake Factory and beware, when you look at the menu, it is massive which will make you very indecisive!! I wasn't too hungry so I ordered the Tomato and Fresh Mozzarella Cherry Tomatoes, Garlic, Mozzarella, Fontina and Parmesan Cheeses. This was only 5.95. I asked if they could add basil on it as well and they were kind enough to do that and it was the perfect size for little me! Seafood Salad Lump Crab, Shrimp, Avocado, Tomato, Corn, Green Beans, Egg, Celery and Green Onion Over a Bed of Crisp Romaine Tossed with Our Louis Dressing. I had some of my friends salad and this was super refreshing and filling! Potato Gnocchi with Vodka Sauce Simply Delicious Housemade Gnocchi Tossed in Our Creamy Vodka Sauce and Fresh Basil. Omg this was delicious....after a few bites! I recommend ordering this but please SHARE with all the people at your table! It can get kind of sickening after a few bites because it is so rich!! Asian Pear Martini Absolut Vanilia Vodka, Pear, Passion Fruit and Sake. Great martini if you want something refreshing and sweet! A little pricey though...about 13. Overall, great place to eat with a variety of choices!! NOTE: -Opened late for all you drunkies;) -5 minute grace period if you happen to be a tad late
