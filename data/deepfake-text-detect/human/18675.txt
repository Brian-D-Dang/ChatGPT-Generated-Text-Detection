To me, it feels as though it's just wholly superfluous. One of the main reasons for CS to be administered is to raise student diligence and attendance. However, as most students already have multiple extracurriculars, this will only push out their schedule and increase stress. While there may be slackers which CS could improve, they will heuristically be averse to actually doing the work, and bail. That's another problem- even if it was a flawless plan, there's no way to actually tell if someone did the work. Community service also relies on the idea that the student has the time for it. Many students have jobs aswell, and if one lives in poverty and has to work for extended periods of time for their family, they may have no time for community service. CMV
