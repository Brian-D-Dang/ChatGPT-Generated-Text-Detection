I used to be a staunch conservative Christian. That is, until I realized that if I could not reason my beliefs, and give an account for why I believe them, I shouldn't hold those beliefs. As I began reasoning, I slowly lost my faith. The ability to reason is one of humankind's greatest and most important features. I think that to have any belief that cannot be scientifically verified is ridiculous. How could one hold something to be true to themselves and know that it can't be substantiated? And by "believe" I am referring to any opinion that is just that - an opinion, but conceived of as fact.
