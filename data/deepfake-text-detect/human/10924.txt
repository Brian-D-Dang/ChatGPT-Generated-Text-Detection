I assume you are actually turning your phone off, not having the screen turn black (in which case the phone is still definitively active). Removing the batteries from a device you do not use for a while is a common advice for saving batteries. This is because they are still "leaks" and the device drains some energy from the battery. However, even an unplugged battery will still wear off after a long time. Moreover, some features of the phone are still working when it is totally turned off. It is more widely known for computers, where there is a small battery (even for fixed computers) that will allow some chips to keep track of the time even when the computer is turned off. On some computers, the memory of the BIOS is volatile, meaning that it needs energy not to be lost; a common way to reset the password of the BIOS is to unplug the computer and remove this internal battery. I expect to find similar features on a phone.
