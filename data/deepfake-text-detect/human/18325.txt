Hi reddit, first time posting here and this is a big one that i've believed for a while. First off let me explain what possiblianism is: "Our ignorance of the cosmos is too vast to commit to atheism, and yet we know too much to commit to a particular religion. A third position, agnosticism, is often an uninteresting stance in which a person simply questions whether his traditional religious story (say, a man with a beard on a cloud) is true or not true. But with Possibilianism I'm hoping to define a new position one that emphasizes the exploration of new, unconsidered possibilities. Possibilianism is comfortable holding multiple ideas in mind; it is not interested in committing to any particular story." - David Eaglemen Now, some of my favorite writers such as Sam Harris have stated that this belief system is simply atheism in a new shell. I disagree. I've found that the word Atheism means that a godgods doesn't exist and that there isn't a chance of any form of it. Even Richard Dawkins has stated in the God Delusion that Atheists today are not full blown atheists in the sense that they are not on the pure opposite side of the spectrum of creationist who are 100 certain there is a god. Its normally around 99 percent or so which makes me feel that the word atheism which comes from the Greek language "Without God" isn't appropriate for where most of us already stand. Perhaps it is more of a defintional thing, but the idea of holding all ideas with value and using what we know about the world to shift our views on the spectrum of Belief II Belief Non- Belief I find that perhaps it is unlikely, but we certainly do not have the evidence to support that a god or gods doesnt exist. I originally registered myself as an atheist, but after coming across this term a few years ago this is where I have stood. I've always felt that this term better explained how many atheists felt, but most of us didn't know it actually existed. CMV reddit
