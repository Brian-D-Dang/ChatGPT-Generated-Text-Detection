1. USAUK spying on EU communications, which has been brought to light recently, is so invasive and systematic that it goes beyond "keeping tabs on your friends" and into outright hostile territory. The bugging of foreign offices and tapping of internal communications in a systematic and extensive way is expected against an enemy, not a friend. As the Germans aptly put it, this is reminiscent of Cold War spying against Soviet block countries. 2. As far as we know, this is only business as usual for the USA and its intelligence partners. We don't know of any European country operation to systematically intercept internal USA communications or bug USA foreign offices. This level of hostility appears to be unilateral. 3. The revelations come at a time when the USA is trying to negotiate an extensive trade agreement with the EU. At the same time that the USA is calling for mutual trust and cooperation it is revealed it treats its supposed friends not much better than its enemies.
