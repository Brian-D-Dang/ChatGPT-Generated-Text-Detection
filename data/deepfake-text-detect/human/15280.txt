We went for sunday brunch, I like the fact they open at 7am, I figure everyone still sleeping nursing late night hangovers. I was right at 7 am only a handful of us old folks in line... The buffet was very limited and not many items. For about 25 bucks a head you should get more. The hot foods were mostly breakfast items what happend to the lunch part of brunch. Very sad. Everthing was fresh as it should be since we were their early. Still can't believe a beautiful casino,' upscale would have a brunch that was so simple. Spend a few more bucks and go to wynn, or bellagio. Service was fine.
