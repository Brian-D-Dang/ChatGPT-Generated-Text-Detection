We can look at a star's mass and spectrum and say a star will go "soon," which to an astronomer means definitely some time between now and about a million years in the future. For example, we're currently waiting patiently for a red giant star called Betelgeuse in the constellation Orion to go supernova. It has already used up most of it's hydrogen fuel and is clearly on its last legs. The supernova will be visible "soon." Eta Carinae is also visible to the naked eye and predicted to go off in the near-ish future. Dying stars are unlikely to be much of a threat to Earth. There is nothing big enough, close enough and pointed in the right direction to do much damage, although the radiation from either Eta Carinae or Betelgeuse might damage some satellites. You actually just missed a good one, in astronomical time, by about 1000 years. SN 1006 was brighter than a full moon from Earth. There have been [many other easily visible supernovas] (URL0) but none in modern times.','In astronomy the term "century" is used about as often as "nanosecond" is in normal speech. We can narrow it down to about a million years, but under no circumstances ever down to a certain date.','Well, the thing is stars stay pretty bright after dying, and in some cases get much much brighter.
