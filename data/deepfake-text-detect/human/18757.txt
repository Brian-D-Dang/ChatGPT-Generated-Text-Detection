I've argued this to friends before and stand by it. If I have the decision and free will to do A, B, C or X, Y, Z in my life or in my day, then God can not be omniscient and know what is going to happen because ultimately the decision is up to me. Now the rebuttal I always hear is that "you have this free will but even though you have so many choices God will still know what you are going to do," which I think is a weak argument because then I say well then there is no free will and the two can not coexist. Assuming there is a God, human free will and God's omniscience can't coexist. CMV.
