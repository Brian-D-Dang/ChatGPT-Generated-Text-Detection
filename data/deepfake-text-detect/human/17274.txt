I've been teaching for over a decade and the demands that are placed on me, on my colleagues baffle me. Aside from having to instruct students on how to mind their manners and be polite - not sit down or pay attention or keep working - when the public hears of 'students gone wild' the narrative turns to schools. Basic skills like critical thinking, financial planning, etc. seem to be the job of the system and not the parents. I'm not even going to get into the morale boosting we have to do. When students fail, it's the school. Not the parents. Not the fact no one is around for them or they have to make themselves dinner... I taught in a program where if a student was too ill to go to school I would visit and teach all 56 subjects. One student was an English Learner and had poor English skills for the duration of his time in the US. I asked the student to get books he has. He came out with a Marvel comic and a 3rd grade novel with the first 20 pages missing. I asked his parents (the student had to translate) if they could get him books. His dad responded if the student doesn't read them he's not going to buy them - while backdropped by his 70" TV. I've had parents who barely speak sign language. I've had parents who just don't know how to do obvious discipline with their kids - "he yells at me!" I could go on and on. I understand there are systemic issues at play, however teachers are the ones without a chair when the music stops. Teachers need a job description because what parents don't do, falls to us. Parents should have to know how to parent before they come to me.
