My job was suppose to provide me a company car from the Las Vegas government agency. But they ran out of their vehicles. So without making any reservations from one of many rental car companies by McCarran Airport, I picked one and chose Dollar Rent a Car. The only compact car that was available was the Toyota Prius. The fuel-efficient vehicle is only a week old with less than 300 miles. I paid 59.00 a day. Might cost a lot, but at least I don't need to drain much on gas. Hey, I'm by myself in Vegas. You expect me to rent a Town Car or something nicer? Nevermind, don't answer!
