I am talking mainly about 1st world countries here. Basically from what I can tell in the last half a century the age for having children for most people has gone up from 15-30 to 25-60, further more there are a lot of fertility treatments that allow women that sometimes have a less fit reproductive system to reproduce normally. I know that all ovaries are formed before puberty but the genetic material they contain deteriorates over time, and it's the same deal with the genetic material in sperm. A child born when his parents are 50 is statistically more likely to have minor or major problem due to his genes than a child born when his parents were 18. Now adding to that the fact that mentally ill people are allowed to reproduce, and many people that wouldn't have hit puberty, be able to deliver a baby or live past 20-30 are now having kids because modern medicine keeps them alive and relatively well. Also a huge of women seem to be against abortion even if the child is known to have a genetic issue or is likely to have one. And we struggle to keep even the weakest of kids alive. With all this in mind, and considering that 60 years ago basically non of this was happening, I sometimes think that it is very likely that within 30-50 years more we might have a very depressing generations of kids born across 1st world countries. So anyone with knowledge in biology, medicine or what have you. Please give me the counter arguments to what I said, which I assume are many, and try changing my view.
