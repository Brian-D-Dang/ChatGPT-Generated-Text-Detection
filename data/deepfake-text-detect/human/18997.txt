VITAL EDIT: This isn't "convince me not to murder people." This is "convince me that America can get better without violence." I'm aware that killing is bad. So far I haven't really gained much hope for our country though. ... With Congress's approval at hilarious lows due to obvious self-interest, I wish I could believe the bad eggs will be replaced by good, but it's hard to think that way when money buys elections in the manner that we see today. I can't shake the feeling that anyone willing to shell out the kind of money it takes to campaign for an office of any importance couldn't possibly have any understanding of (or loyalty to) anyone anywhere near the poverty line, and any insinuation otherwise is a ploy for votes that will fall aside after election day. Our government's love of money only goes to bolster the influence of corporations. The idea that capitalism lets you vote with your wallet becomes a joke when any business big enough to buy influence can get bailouts if we stop buying their product. The people at the top have even less to worry about, leaving even the worst sinking ship having already made more money than my entire hometown will make in their lives. We protest, we vote, and we spend all our time saying "Wasn't my fault!" Meanwhile zero things get done. People love the second amendment because the government should be afraid of its people. Well fun fact: They fucking aren't. Please, for the love of god, change my view before I get myself arrested.
