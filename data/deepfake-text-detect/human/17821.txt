I have no problem with the NSA scanning my emailsphone records in the interests of national security. In fact, I think it's a little silly for the average person to be worried that they'll be snatched up by the government for... well, no one ever seems to give a reason, they just assume the government is after them. I'm also surprised that so many people are invoking the slippery slope argument. Do you really think the U.S. government can get away with a totalitarian state? Think of the manpower required to pull that off without full-scale revolt. I think that some concessions in privacy are to be expected if people want to feel secure. We (or a majority, at least) already post all our thoughts and location to Faacebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google Maps, etc. If we agree to give those "freedoms" up for a company, surely we'd give them up to catch would-be terrorists? Now, after all of that, you might be wondering why I want to change my view. Well, with everyone outraged, I feel like I'm missing something. Reddit, cut through the hyperbole and CMV.
