When the technology permits reliable detection of and intervention in (medicallyphysically) the genetic disease of addiction in newyoung children, I believe it should be permanently excised, and doing so should be legally required. I believe addiction is one of history's greatest scourges, and modern science offers very poor hope of recovery for many people and even when recovery is possible, the physical yearning will never truly cease (see the movie Pleasure Unwoven for a scientific explanation for how addiction works: ). Therefore, I believe that when it is possible, we should physically alter peoples' brains to not have the disease of addiction. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
