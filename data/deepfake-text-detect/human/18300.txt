I'm house-sitting for my mother this weekend, and she left the key under the mat. I realized that if someone wanted to break in without kicking anything down or making too much noise, they could have easily guessed there might be a spare key there. The fact is, leaving your spare key under the mat is simply cliche. We see it in cartoons, TV shows, and far too many people do it. The mat is not an effective hiding place. I'm sure that most of the people reading this have hidden or taken a key from under their welcome mat at some point. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
