I recently had this debate with someone close to me due to a thread on Reddit. We were discussing whether somebody (person A), who knows that another person (person B) is marriedengagedin a relationship, is doing something wrong when they accept person B's proposition to have sex. While I agree that the betrayal happens at the time Person B decides and commits to cheating, I feel that Person A is still scummy for accepting B's proposition. The other point of view, which I just cannot reconcile myself with, is that the harm has already been done to the relationship through B's choice to cheat, and A is just benefiting from the situation without actually doing harm to the relationship. I get a headache whenever I try to understand it that way - it just seems to me to be twisting logic and rationality in a way that justifies something that isn't necessarily "wrong" (but is still bad, to me). CMV with some logic that can make sense of this argument, please.
