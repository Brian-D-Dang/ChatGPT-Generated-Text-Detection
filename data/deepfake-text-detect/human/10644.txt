Because evolution works really slowly, and our bodies and teeth are still pretty much the same as they were 10,000 years ago. 10,000 years ago, we only really needed one set of teeth (baby teeth aside). Chances are you would have passed on your genes and be dead long before your teeth gave up. Thus as a species we never evolved regrowing teeth - it didnt increase our likleyhood of survival. Cut forward 10,000 years to today.... its a bit of a bastard, as we have made rapid medical advances in the past few hundreds years, and our life expectancy has gone up massively. Suddenly the likleyhood of us outliving our teeth is quite likley, and now we need to take care of them.
