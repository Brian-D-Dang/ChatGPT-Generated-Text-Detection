I mean, they are people as well, how does their age make them special enough to be exempt from receiving punishment for doing something bad If a 13 year old kid commits a murder, shoot him, hang him thats what he deserves. He caused pain, he caused grief, he brought it upon himself. Just because he's 13, doesnt mean he isn't able to make a choice. I feel like we are making a big mistake by putting children and adults into two categories. All people deserve the same punishment. that is equality. When we were all kids we knew right and wrong, we knew bad and good, we know now that we knew then. Why should we excuse 13-14 year olds who kill, steal and destroy peoples lives for what they do? How is that even right? IMO they deserve punishment, a bad deed done is a bad deed done and age shouldnt be the factor in deciding the punishment but rather the deed should be TLDR: Juvenile detention centers should just merge with prisons, kids deserve to be punished for their actions
