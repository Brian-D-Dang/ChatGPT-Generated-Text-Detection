Basically I believe that a morally just society is one that maximizes its citizen's happiness. My main foundation for this belief is that a society's happiness trumps other rights such as one's property rights. The example that is brought up most often is the drowning child in the pond. Most would say one has a moral obligation to save that child as long as one is cable of doing so. So one would save the child even though saving the child may cause that person to be late for work or ruin their clothes. Now take this and apply it to money. If the money that one uses to buy a car can save the lives of 30 people in a developing nation and one chooses to buy a car then that person is basically picking the car over the lives of those 30 people. There are a few criticisms that I keep hearing about utilitarianism. One is that certain groups might be oppressed. For example the happiness obtained by the majority of the population might exceed the suffering of tiny minority that they enslave. The other is one is the utility monster. I believe that both are valid criticism of utilitarianism but as with any other philosophical thoughts, utilitarianism is not perfect. I just find that these two scenarios are somewhat unlikely compared to the down sides of other ethical theories. I understand that to be a true utilitarian is practically impossible. I dont plan on giving away all my money or donating my kidney or part of my liver and neither do many proponents of utilitarianism. But just because I can't meet the demands that utilitarianism requires does not make this type of thinking any less true. So change my view guys. What ethical theories would be better than utilitarianism?
