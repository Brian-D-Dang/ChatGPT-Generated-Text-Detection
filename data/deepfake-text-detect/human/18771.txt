People's (society's) needs shouldn't be put in a position to be taken advantage of. If people need it to survive or live in relative comfort, then the opportunity to allow corruption to get involved shouldn't even be there. These are things we all need as humans to function and that society as a whole needs to function, so why not have them taken care of across the board (instead of putting profits from them in a select few people's hands) and let people worry more about contributing to society and humanity about other things.
