In my opinion, a country like china, with its abundance of natural resources, historical dominance, advantages geographical location, and intellectual community, would flourish under minimal government intervention. Taking Hong Kong as an example, often described as "one country, two systems" became the worlds biggest experiment of capitalism meets the east. Yet, it is hosts some of the worlds most competitive leaders of financial and business centers. China through heavy intervention of the government, has severely restricted the expansion of the World Wide Web (great firewall of china). These restrictions as a result have heavily reduced domestic competition, resulting in domestic copycat alternatives for twitter, Facebook, eBay, etc. These alternatives rarely innovate, ergo, contribute virtually nothing to technological innovations, and to humanity as a whole. They lag behind competitive global corporations, such as Google, Apple, Microsoft, and even tech start ups around the world. Thanks, I look forward to seeing replies.
