I've often heard that there is a difference between listening to an audiobook and reading the physical copy of the book. In my own personal terms, I don't have a lot of free time. When I'm doing something that doesn't require a lot of concentration (cleaning, traveling) I'll often listen to an audiobook. My mind is focused on the story, but I am able to perform chores etc. Essentially, what is the difference between a book you read and a book narrated to you? It's the same content by the same author. The main counterarguments I can imagine are: 1) The main difference between listening to an audiobook and reading it off the page is the narratorimages in your head as audiobooks are influenced by whomever is reading it. 2) Audiobooks don't require the same level of concentration as reading a physical copy of the book does. This might lead people to miss details. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
