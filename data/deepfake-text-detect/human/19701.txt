My girlfriend is amazing. She is gorgeous, funny, smart and sexy. She does more then her fair share of housework and never complains. I do all the cooking, as she can't cook, but she loves my food and always flatters it. She is willing to try any of my favourite things, and loves almost everything I love, so I can include her in almost every aspect of my life. Sexually, she is almost perfect. She is into anal sometimes, and many of the other kinky things I am into. However, they all require me to be dominant. 98 of the time I don't mind, because that's where I would rather be. However, sometimes I'd like to be on the bottom. She is not willing to to be in charge. And she very very rarely agrees to blowjobs, which is a real bummer for me as I LOVE them. I even agree to use a flavoured condom, but she will do it at most once monthly. I really wish it didn't bother me, because she is so amazing and I love her to pieces, but it really bothers me when she says no repeatedly. I am willing to do anything for her (she doesn't drive so I'll pick her up and drive her to work all the time, even when I work night shifts and it seriously fucks with my sleeping, I'll go shopping with her which just pisses me off when I start getting bored and have zero interest, but I'll fake it (somewhat) for her, and I'll put up with her family, who I can't stand, and pretty much anything else to make her smile. Is it unreasonable for me to be upset about the one thing I have a problem with?
