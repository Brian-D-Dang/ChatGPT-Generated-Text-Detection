Now in the spirit of fairness - I believe this to be true for all governments, but in this case I'll touch upon the U.S. gov. First of all [Lusatania] the U.S. government deliberately loaded a civilian ship with munitions, so that the German can sink it and the population be dragged into a war they wanted nothing to do with. Second - [Gulf of Tonkin] where the government lied about engaging enemy targets, in order to stimulate the population into supporting the Vietnam War. Third - [Nayirah] testified before congress to encourage U.S. into entering the Gulf War Forth - [MKUltra] is a thing. After this, how can anyone trust the government in any way? It's insane to give it more power.
