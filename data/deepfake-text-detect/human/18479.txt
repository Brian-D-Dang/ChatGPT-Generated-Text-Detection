I decided on this issue after reading a recent story about black women in the military saying that their hair is incompatible with hair regulations. With the recent push to make women serve equally in the military, I believe it only makes sense that they be subject to the same hair standards as men. Consider this: 1. Long hair is a liability, in which case nobody should have it. 2. Long hair is not a liability, in which case men should be allowed to have hair at least as long as women. I am open to changing hair regulations based on the combat role, but the regulations must be applied equally to all people in that role. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
