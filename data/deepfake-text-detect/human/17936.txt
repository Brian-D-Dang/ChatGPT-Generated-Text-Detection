[Preface: I believe in an objective morality (The Categorical Imperative), so I believe many times judging is wrong, in cases where either your motivations are wrong (Judging because it makes you feel good), manner of judging is wrong, or the behavior you judge isn't wrong.] In my quest against moral relativism, I run into this belief quite a lot. My objections are twofold: 1. It's a performative contradiction: It states that judging is wrong, but as judging itself doesn't hurt people any more than other nonphysical behaviors could, how can one hold this maxim? 2. Anecdotally, nobody actually believes this, least of all the people who profess it. Because my argument is a simple one, I have only ever heard one objection; Judging in fact does hurt other people. The argument usually follows the following general pattern. "Objection 1: Judging inflicts psychological harm, therefore it hurts other people Counter 1: Suppose I grant the premise. What if someone is so neurotic that innocent yet nonessential behaviors cause them extreme psychological harm? O1: Their neurosis is probably sufficiently rare that no one can be expected to accomadate them. However, almost everybody is bothered by being judged. C1: Apply this principle elsewhere. It isn't beyond the realm of possibility that most people were deeply bothered by homosexuality in the 1800s. [Or similar hypothetical] Would any open gays in that time be inviting morally appropriate judgement by your standards? Would you condemn them? O1: No, C1: Then clearly we have an agent defined, rather than a patient based definition of what people are allowed to do without being judged."
