Yes, sometimes driver's get lost, sometimes pizza places screw up, sometimes (i guess) it takes 2 hours to deliver a pizza within a 12 mile radius WITHOUT ever apologizing unless badged by the customer. Always nice to get attitude over the phone for their screw ups and a ton of attitude from the driver. Was the pizza any good? Not that good. Avoid.
