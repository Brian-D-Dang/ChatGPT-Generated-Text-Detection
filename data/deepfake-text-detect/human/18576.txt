To clarify, I am in an environment where promise rings are a commonplace item i.e. an average American highschool. A few of my friends and I have discussed before the concept of a promise ring, that is, a ring given prior to engagement to symbolize a future marriage between the person giving the ring and given the ring. I found out that in my circle of friends, I am the only one who has this view on the rings! My best friend even got upset with me for implying that it meant something less than what it is portrayed as. I apologized, but my view still holds. I find that, to quote a post I saw in AskMen earlier, the concept of a physical sign of a promise that one day you will give her a physical sign of a promise to one day give her a physical sign of your promise to stick with her forever is asinine and convoluted. It seems almost as if it was a contrived marketing strategy by a big jeweler. Pass something off as tradition, and sell it marked up ridiculously. If you love someone, tell them. Stay with them. You do not need three different rings, each one symbolizing the same promise, to tell someone that you need them in your life.
