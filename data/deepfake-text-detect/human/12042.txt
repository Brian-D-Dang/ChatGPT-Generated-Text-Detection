Attacking midfielder Christensen, 22, has played more than 50 games for the London side, but has not started a Championship match this season. Striker Woodrow, 22, has only started one league match but scored twice in the EFL Cup against Leyton Orient. Both players are available to face QPR on Saturday. Brewers manager Nigel Clough said: "Lasse has a good season or so under his belt in the Championship. He's been a bit unlucky not to feature much this season, but they see him in their long-term plans and it will help him to play for us. "Cauley is one to add to our striking options. With Luke Varney out for four to six weeks and Will Miller's hamstring injury, it was important to get another striker in."
