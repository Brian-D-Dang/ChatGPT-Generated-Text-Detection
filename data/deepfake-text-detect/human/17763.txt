If they were really so torn up about it, they wouldn't be exploiting their grief for fake internet points that don't mean anything. People are literally whoring their fake emotions for karma. I absolutely hate it, and I don't really understand why somebody would post something like that other than to rake in upvotes. I could maybe understand wanting support from the community, but what does a hundred "hang in there"s from faceless entities on the internet mean in the wake of losing a loved one. CMV
