This place is wonderful! I ordered the Sesame Encrusted Salmon and it was the best thing I've had in a while! I could have done without the spinach as they were more on the fried side and I was expecting it to be sauteed. Spinach wasn't horrible but should have been an appetizer. My mother had the French Dip and she was more than pleased. The sweet potato waffle fries are a must have, and I don't even like sweet potatoes. Portions were plentiful with the exception of the Baby Back Ribs.
