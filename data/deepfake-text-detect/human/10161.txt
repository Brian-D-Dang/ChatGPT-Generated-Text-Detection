I am a husband and father of two. I love my wife, and I love my children, but I am not a fan of Father's Day. I feel the "holiday," if one can call it that, forces people to adopt a tradition that bills itself very similarly to a birthday...which I already have once a year. If you want to appreciate someone it should be done on an individual basis and not based on some yearly Hallmark Holiday. Yes, I feel the same about Mother's Day, but I'll be damned if I don't go through the motions. I feel much the same way about many of the other "appreciation days" (e.g. Administrative Professionals Day, Thank a Mailman Day, etc.). You are thanking someone for doing what they chose to do. Society should not force an expectation on others to give you praise for the things you choose to do or become. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
