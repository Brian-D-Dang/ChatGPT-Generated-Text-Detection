I don't see the disadvantage CP poses on anyone. As long as both parties and the parties responsible for them are fine with it, I don't see how it's any worse than regular adult material. There is the argument that it will destroy the lives of the people participating, but I don't see how that's the case with CP any more than with people who have just turned 18 and can still make choices they will later regret. I don't see how it is any more disgusting than prolapse material, for example. If the people involved are consenting then there is no harm done. Why is it so widely considered disgusting and wrong? I personally am not into it, but I never understood why it's considered to be so bad.
