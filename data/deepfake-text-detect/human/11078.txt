It's caused by suggestibility. Your brain is constantly building a model of your environment for you to navigate. This model isn't perfect. You can't take in everything around you so you brain fills in the information gaps with what you know the world is like. Like if you throw an imaginary ball for a dog and he chases after nothing. You have suggested a ball was thrown so the dog's brain says there's a ball. Your brain is told there's a string. You relax into that string imagining. Your brains builds that fact into your world model. When you open your hands your brain finds an information gap were a string feeling should be, so it builds a string feeling for you to experience. Your brain is filling these information gaps all day long for you but you only notice when it gets it wrong. This kind of trick makes you notice.
