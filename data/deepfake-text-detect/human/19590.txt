We are all familiar with the concept of racism, but what exactly does it mean? The traditional definition implies an irrational hatred or disliking of certain ethnicities, or races. But if you switch the word ethnicity with any generic adjective you are given the definition of prejudice. Prejudice is still considered a negative concept, but it is far more socially acceptable than racism. Most people seem to accept that humans are inherently social creatures who tend to dislike others for intangible reasons. This is just the way it is. Even the nicest people in the world find certain people obnoxious or annoying. I believe that racism is simply a form of prejudice that has become stigmatized. If I say that I don't like hipsters because I find their culture obnoxious or dumb, nobody bats an eye. But if I say that I don't like black people because I find their culture obnoxious or dumb, I'm racist. Just to clarify, I am not racist towards any particular people but I, like everyone else, inevitably find some people to be bad people, regardless of the color of their skin or where their family is from.
