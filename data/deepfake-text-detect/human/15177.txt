Very overpriced for starters, but that would be fine if the food was worth it. Many of the patrons were drunk and loud, so have a feeling this is a place for rich lawyers to call home and throw their money at. That's fine, just not looking to throw 35 for a mediocre steak and have to deal with profane-laced loud conversations and hooting and hollering that belongs in a sports bar. Totally overrated.
