I did a quick search about this, but didn't find a thread directly addressing this. My view is that energy weapons (lasers, emps) will never completely replace technology that is based on a "gun." Projectile weapons will always have a place because they're based off of a physical chemical reaction that can't be altered by any sort of energy power failure. This may be a futurology-type debate, however I didn't completely form this opinion until the Navy has both completed successful tests of both rail guns, and lasers. The fact that a railgun is still a serious option for the Navy gives a lot of weight to my point. CMV, reddit. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
