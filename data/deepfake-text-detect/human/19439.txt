My first and immediate problem with Malala in particular is that she is a teenage kid. Her views of the world, regardless of her background or the socio-political situation of her home country, are little better than that of any other teenager, yet she is still feted as being some heroine. Plus what is crucially ignored by too many people, in my opinion, is that she was getting an education, whilst thousands, if not millions of girls don't have that opportunity at all, much less the higher education she receives. I also have the issue that she, along with others, have actually done little in the way of any actual action. She's talked, which anyone can do, but she has not actually done anything. She's not raised money for a school, she's not lifted a brick to build one, she's not taught a single minute of a school lesson. There are thousands of people who actually do these things, and they are, in my eyes, doing an infinite amount better towards improving education than Malala is ever capable of doing. If she really wanted to improve education, she should become a teacher and provide that ideal education. So, change my view.
