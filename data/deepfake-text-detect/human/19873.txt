We live in a technological world. Facebook, twitter, reddit, tumblr and all social networks that exist right now allowed us to say what we think, what we believe, what we experience, what we eat, where we go, our clothes and all of that stuff. I believe that self-esteem is pointless in modern days, because we all have a "tsunami" of people saying that we are awesome and pretty and have beautiful friends (yes, I know that sometimes it's a fake compliment) and having a high self-esteem, in my view, stops us of growing and getting better. I believe that self-hate is a much more powerful source of strenght and force to overcome difficulties and growth. People everywhere say that self-esteem and self-love are the keys to a good life, but I just believe that is pointless. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
