I know this is a very specific topic, but its extremely important to the future of Africa right now, especially because of plans outlined by conservation groups internationally. Eco-tourism is a relatively new practice of helping the economies of African regions by allowing tourists to personally visit rare species in the forest or small groups of primates (and so on). The large problem now is that disease spread has increased at an alarming rate, putting species at risk like the Bonobo and Mountain Gorilla. Alongside disease, deforestation is a must for establishing infrastructure and roads for the tourism, which all harms the very land they intend to protect. I want to hear if anyone has any specific good reasons that Eco-tourism is overall more good than harmful.
