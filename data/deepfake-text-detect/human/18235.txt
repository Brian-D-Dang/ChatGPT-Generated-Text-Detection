When it comes to ethics and morality I always tend to find secular arguments toothless for one primary reason: The atheistprogressive worldview has no hell for me to burn in, no punishment for not embracing their tenets, so why should I care about whether or not i'm a good person by any of their standards? Mind you, i'm not talking about being law-abiding citizen: I'm talking about all those other ways you can be an asshole without being a murderer, a rapist or what have you. I just feel progressivism will forever lack teeth in trying to guide people's principles because if there's no afterlife and therefore no punishmentreward after all is said and done, why care what they think?
