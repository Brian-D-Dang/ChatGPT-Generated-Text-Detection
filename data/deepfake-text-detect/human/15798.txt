Luther was a prolific hymn-writer, authoring hymns such as "Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott" A Mighty Fortress Is Our God, based on Psalm 46, and "Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her" From Heaven Above to Earth I Come, based on Luke 2:11-12. Luther connected high art and folk music, also all classes, clergy and laity, men, women and children. His tool of choice for this connection was the singing of German hymns in connection with worship, school, home, and the public arena. He often accompanied the sung hymns with a lute, later recreated as the waldzither that became a national instrument of Germany in the 20th century.
