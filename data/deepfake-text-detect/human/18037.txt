Disclaimer: By men I mean straight men for the duration of the post. Men are very often thought of as viewing women as sex objects, or only wanting to see them naked. I believe that most men actually think that women are more attractive while wearing flattering clothing than when they are naked. I don't mean to say that men don't want to see women with their clothes off, but that men judge women's attractiveness with their clothes on rather than by what they think they would look like with their clothes off. I don't necessarily want to have my mind changed about this but I do think it's an interesting discussion topic and I'm more than willing to have my mind changed on the matter.
