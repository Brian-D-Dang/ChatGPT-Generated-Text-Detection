Note: I am not "pro-pageant," and would certainly never force my child partake in them. Complaints on reddit about the evils of child beauty pageants are not at all difficult to come by. Every "What is something that is legal but shouldn't" askreddit thread is typically headed by this sentiment. From what I've seen, beauty pageants take on a "cutesy" vibe, not a sexual one. None of the kids seem to be in any immediate danger, and of course every law in place to protect kids still applies. Also, prohibition on these pageants would either be lax to the point of uselessness, so stringent that they become a slippery slope and will be enforced in other areas. In conclusion, the kids seem to be in no danger, it falls under freedom of speech, and parents supporting their daughter in pageants is no different than supporting their son playing football.
