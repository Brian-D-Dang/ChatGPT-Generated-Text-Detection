I'm from New Zealand and overseas drivers were involved in at least 558 crashes that resulted in death or injury last year. Or one in 12 crashes. I was reading about a man from Asia who crashed head on into family of four and killed their five year old daughter, he was trying to pass a car around a blind corner and when the police asked why he was passing around a blind corner his response was that he didn't know he wasn't allowed to because there were no yellow lines. I believe there should be a law in place to try and prevent this from happening again.
