I think tattoos and piercings take away from their femininity, I want to make it clear I'm not debating looks or body type. To me there is nothing more trashy than a giant piercing through a woman's nose, and a full sleeve. It's not pretty, or cute, it's really scuzzy looking. I have female friends who have artistic designs on their shoulders and arms, and others have cartoon characters. They all look just as terrible. I see tattoos are hugely popular, gaining traction in the work world too, "tattoo acceptance" is a terrible movement as well. I feel like maybe I'm just not appreciating them perhaps, or maybe there just not doing it for me, but I think in general men and women look really bad with excessive tattoos, and it makes it worse by taking away from women's femininity. Edit: I think some things need to be stressed here, I'm open to being proven wrong, but so far all I've seen is the argument that it's just like my opinion man, how I want to control what women do, and how women should be allowed freedom of speech. I never said women should have the right to get a tattoo taken away, I just said I believe it takes away from their femininity. Naturally women with tattoos are going to debate that, I was hoping for something like that but instead I got a bunch of white knighting and pissed off women that took my meaning as to they shouldn't be allowed to do something.
