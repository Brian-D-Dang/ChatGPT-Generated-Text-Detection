Let me tell you a story about a casino being rebuilt and re-branded. They closed down, let everyone know that they were coming back better than ever next year, and took their lumps knowing that the reward would be worth the effort. That place...is Bill's Gambling Saloon. It's not the Quad. The Quad, on the other hand, went another route: rename the venue, slowly renovate the casino portion of the building, and then sit on their asses while the rest of the building falls apart. My friends and I stayed at the Quad last week as we were looking for a cheap place to stay while on our Vegas trip. We stayed for five nights which is why we skimped on accommodations. I don't know how the new owners get away with calling this place anything except the Imperial Palace; the rooms are the same, the carpets are the same, the decor is the same...seriously, the only thing that makes it worth even entertaining the notion of staying is Hash House a-Go Go. That restaurant is the only clean part of the whole hotel. If the new ownership group had anyone with a brain left in that place they'd shut it down, do a real and full remodel, and open when the smell of cigarettes and urinal cakes finally dissipates. Seriously, the hotel is falling apart. I was weary of staying there but the price swayed me. I wish it hadn't. For the love of all that is both holy and unholy in this world, DON'T STAY HERE. Wait until the renovations are done, wait for people to review the renovations...and then wait until the gleam wears off to see if it's still worth it. You can go cheap almost anywhere on the strip at this point; the Flamingo is cheap and pretty and right next door. Plus, what asshole approved 6-to-5 payouts for Blackjack? Idiot.
