The usual argument for states' rights is "if you don't like the laws in one state, then you can move to another." After moving states this summer, I have come to appreciate the vast amount of capital that it takes to move across states. This would make it near impossible for most people in the country to change locations based on what laws they want to abide by. It also seems that with issues like abortion that states' rights advocates talk about, the laws would affect those with less income (who can't leave the state) to a greater degree than those with enough money to leave the state.
