Uber has launched a new option that allows passengers to communicate their preferences to drivers before they are picked up. Uber Comfort costs around 20 to 40 percent more than UberX rides, but passengers are able to signal their preferred car temperature and whether they would like their driver to remain silent during the trip. The quiet mode has been well received by both drivers and passengers. Uber Comfort vehicles need to meet higher vehicle make, model, year, and legroom requirements, while maintaining a 4.85 or higher rating to be eligible. It is now available in 43 cities and smaller states across the US, and also in Ottawa, Canada.
