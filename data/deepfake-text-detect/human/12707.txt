I'm scared. Of all the things that might happen Of all the things that might not The people I may hurt The people I may help Nothing makes sense Everything is false Nobody is true Rejection Compassion The weight of the unknown sits on my shoulders Pushing me down with every passing minute I'm scared Of throwing away everything I don't need To find out that it's more important to me than anything else The words "You're not my child" The spilt tears over a dead body that has newly been added to a casket built by hate and fear I'm scared Of turning into somebody I want to be Of turning into somebody I don't Love Heartbreaks Anything Everything I'm scared
