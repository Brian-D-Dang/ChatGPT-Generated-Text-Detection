A given long-sleeved men's shirt, assuming that the fabric, weave, color, pattern, c is the same as a short-sleeved men's shirt, is a superior piece of clothing to said short-sleeved shirt. To clarify, by "men's shirt," I mean a button-up, collared shirt designed to be worn by men (i.e. shirts like [this] or [this] , but not tee shirts or Polo shirts). My reasoning is as follows: long-sleeved shirts generally fulfill the same purpose as short-sleeved shirts, while also having other uses and applications that short-sleeved shirts do not. Long-sleeved shirts can be worn in a professional environment without looking cheesy or evoking a car salesman, but can also be dressed down by rolling up the sleeves. The ability to roll up the sleeves also allows one to have variable sleeve length, therefore providing a more versatile garment. Finally, short-sleeved shirts have the stigma of looking silly or unfashionable that long-sleeved shirts do not. For these reasons, I feel long-sleeved men's shirts are generally superior to short-sleeved men's shirts. Please CMV.
