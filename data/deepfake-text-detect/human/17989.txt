For a start, I must say that I have nothing against homosexual marriage. I believe that anyone has the right to choose their own partner and register one's relationship with said partner. When it comes to children, however, the case is different, as the aforementioned parties are not the only ones affected. This does not apply to all homosexuals, but many of them are actively communicating solely with LGBT circles, which will also influence the future relationships of their adopted children. Growing up in an LGBT atmosphere, many people are unable to form healthy relationships of their actual sexual orientation, due to the lack of proper guidance from their parents (How can a lesbian couple teach their son how to converse with girls) as well as the influence of their social circle. Many indulge in homosexual relationships, not because that is their preferred gender, but because it is simply easier , due to their upbringing. I believe that homosexual couples should be able to register their relationships the same as regular couples with the exception of allowed parentage.
