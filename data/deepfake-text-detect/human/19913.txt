Licensing seems to me to be a completely artificial mechanism to increase the cost of opening a business. If I am going to open a bar and serve spirits in California, the total amount of invested money just to do that can be over 20,000 just to be able to pour a drink in a glass. This prevents people without a lot of credit or capital from opening a business like this. The same licensing standards apply to those who want to braid hair, trim nails, give massages, cook hamburgers, or any other number of things that we all do for ourselves and for each other for free but are not permitted to do for strangers at a profit unless we get a piece of paper from a bureaucrat that says we have permission to do so. Additionally, for more premium services like electricians, plumbers, doctors, dentists, medical technicians, etc I believe the requirement for a license decreases competition in the market and makes these services more expensive and thus endangers poorer people who would have the most urgent need of them. Someone who has no certification would have no justification in charging the same money as someone with decades of experience and a number of professional certifications in their area of expertise, so they would need to enter the market a much lower price point. Just as they have street dentists who learned through apprenticeships in places like India providing basic services at a cost the population can afford, this gives a wider variety of services that can cater to more people and leave fewer people stranded without service at all. Change my view. Edited to clarify: I believe licenses and certifications are a great indication that a person has completed a level of competency in their profession, but I do not believe it is appropriate to force a business to shut down for lack of one. The choice of who customers go to for a service should be left to the customer.
