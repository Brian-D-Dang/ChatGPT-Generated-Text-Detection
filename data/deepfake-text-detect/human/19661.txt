I've seen this quote in its many variations used a lot. People use it in response to things like the NSA, the Patriot Act, and other security-related events. I believe that every time this quote is being used, it's being absolutely butchered. If you want to fly anywhere on a plane, you must go through security, which I don't really see people complaining about - especially when the fact that terrorism in the form of crashing and bombing planes has happened comes up. Or even something as simple as having a law that prevents you from stealing from others or killing people. Furthermore, I tend to only really see this quote come up when internet surveillance is in question. In the end my view is that if Benjamin Franklin were alive today, his views would probably be entirely different regarding security. We live in a world where technology is advancing so quickly that our political ethics is having a hard time keeping up, and to me it makes absolutely no sense to cling on to outdated, seemingly naive traditional thoughts. It's only a matter of time before these kind of statements (his quote) seem primitive.
