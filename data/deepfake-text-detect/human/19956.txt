I believe that when you turn 18 you voluntarily accept that you are part of the society you were raised in. Since this country has pretty much always allowed people to leave (the only ones who could make an argument about being forced to come here are slaves, taken by force from other lands and brought here) and renounce their citizenship I feel that this society is ultimately voluntary and anyone who wants to leave can and should do so if they do not want to pay their fair share for the services that are provided to them by others. Furthermore I believe that libertarians are authoritarian in the US because they want to force a voluntary society to be disbanded for their own beliefs. Extending that argument, if they ever got their way they would have to actively suppress communal societies because they would just form into nation-states again and compete for control over landresources with individuals in a way that the individual would always lose to the collective and we would end up again with a society that is ultimately voluntary but communal and is allowed to dictate if people stay or leave if they dodo not contribute to the society.
