Such a shame. This is the exact kind of restaurant Im always looking for. Too bad the staff are oblivious to basic customer service. I've never been in, so I asked if I seat myself or wait to be seated. This question really threw the waiter for a loop. He just didn't know how to answer. Because I was carrying my laptop bag- he was more concerned on whether or not a was giving a lecture or something. Very strange.... Then I had a seat, but Boone came to my table to take my order. So, I notice the order here sign. I got up and asked, is this where I order?. They responded, wherever..... It was like pulling teeth to figure out whether I seat myself or wait to be seated, whether a server takes my order or I order at the counter. It shouldn't be so hard to spend 20 on a lunch and drink- long story short. I just can't support a company with staff that are do co fused and oblivious as to the basic functions of their job or just basic guest service. I've never seen a place run with such confused employees. I mean, who can't day whether its seat yourself or not? Who cannot say whether a server will take your order or whether you order at the counter? Ridiculous.
