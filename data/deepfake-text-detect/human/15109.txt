It's always the same crew that works. They're quite a friendly bunch, but this boutique tailors to street wear for men specifically. I come here once in a while to find gifts for my street wear loving friends. I love some of the items they feature like their shoes, and their apparel, but it's too bad they don't offer them for women. Their tees usually sell for about 28, and they have a wide collection of shoes like Vans, Nikes, Jordans, Air Max, New Balance, Creative Rec, and such... Bummer when I came in though because their credit card machine didn't work and could only take cash so I had to make a run for it to pull out money from an ATM. Thankfully they were nice enough to stay open a little later for you. The place has a nice interior and clean appeal to it. So if gentlemen, if you're looking for some special pieces made by Undefeated. I'd suggest you stop by.
