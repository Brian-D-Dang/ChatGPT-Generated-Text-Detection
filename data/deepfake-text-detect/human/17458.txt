I believe that socialism is better than capitalism. The basis of capitalism is that the hard working have a comfortable life and the non hard workers have a relatively less comfortable life. Sometimes, the people with the less comfortable life work extremely hard only to scrape by. In socialism, every single person has a relatively equal income. I'm not talking about Communism in which there is no currency or ownership, but a market in which everyone is free to spend but the poor are uplifted and the rich are taxed. According to capitalists, socialism corrupts. Under socialism, ideally everyone should have an equal life, can you please try to CMV and offer good arguments for the benefits of capitalism? EDIT: Thank you for all your answers and apologies for not being so clear. You have all definitely showed me the pros to capitalism, and helped me remove the connotation of socialism to a perfectly equal society.
