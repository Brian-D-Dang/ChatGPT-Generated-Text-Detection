The service is pretty darn good. The wine selection is always top notch.... but they lost me on the food! Understand, I have frequented this place since we moved into the area a few years ago. I was a big fan of the handmade pasta and pesto. But is seems as if the focus on the food has slipped, and substantially at that. I'm giving three stars because of our server, Dave. He rocks. And the wine list, pretty much rocks. I haven't checked out the new wine bar, but it looks real nice. But, as for a meal. I'd be surprised if I go back... .... and I am tempted to take that down to two stars.... yeah.... I have to give it a meh.
