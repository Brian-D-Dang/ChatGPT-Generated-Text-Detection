It's our 4th yr anniversary and I persuaded my hubby to watch a Filipino movie which is only shown in summerlin theater, far from where we live. And I searched the area for a good restaurant that is not expensive. I read the reviews about pan asian and got convinced to try it and with the 20 for 10 deal it sounds really good. We got there and greeted by the owner, very pleasing and smiling all the time, felt very welcomed. It's fish Friday so I ordered mostly seafood. Menu prices are all less than 10 but when the food arrived they look so fancy and elegant. I was really impressed and the taste is very good, not your typical Asian cooking where it taste good coz of MSG.... this one, their food taste good because it's fresh and true flavors of the ingredients. My hubby who is not a foodie like me was very impressed too and could not stop eating and after each bite he literally say this is so good in each bite he takes. Even if this is far from our house, we would definitely go back here and buy more of the coupon deal. Calamari is very good, crunchy breading that is just the right amount of coating. Pad Thai is amazing, not the usual yellowish flat noodles in other thai resto, but the flavors are so good together I can eat the noodles by itself even without the meat which means even if I order chicken or shrimp pad Thai I'm sure it will still be very good. Red snapper was very tasty and the sauce super good. Owners are very friendly and inviting, I felt like I was eating at home with Asian family;0)
