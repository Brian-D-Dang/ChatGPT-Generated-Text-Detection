A changing scope and 19th century tactics facing down 20th century realities. As originally conceived by Churchill (yes that Churchill) and his counterparts in the Navy, Gallipoli involved exactly zero ground troops. The thought went something like this. The British had a massive fleet of pre-Dreadnought era battleships that were destined for the scrapyard as they were hopelessly obsolete. Rather than just having them float around doing nothing, the plan was to have them charge head long into the Dardanelles (the strait between the Mediterrianian and the Black Sea) and force the strait against the Turks. The core idea was that these ships were already worthless so why not just throw them into this and if we lose a few ships who the hell cares. However, the Naval commanders and leadership could not stand the thought of sinking these grand old ladies so what was supposed to be a lightning quick strike of overwhelming fire turned into a multi-month long grinding siege that involved terrible management of naval landings and just gave the Turks the chance to kill a few hundred thousand Anzac and British troops.
