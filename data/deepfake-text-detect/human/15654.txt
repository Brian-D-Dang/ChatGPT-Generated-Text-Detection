Where is Eddie or Eddy????? I will not come here any longer if Eddie is not available. To the point a rude service. Technician never looked me in the eye and was turned away from me joking and yakking it up with her colleagues. The place looked like a bomb went off. I have been getting decent to good service till now. But this will be the end if Eddy is not available. Also: everyone of the technicians picks up or checks their personal phone..... While working on your feet or hands.
