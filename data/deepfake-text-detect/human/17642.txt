Most of the schemes I have seen to reduce carbon emissions involve various ways of reducing the carbon emissions of a certain activity. For example we might be encouraged to buy fuel efficient cars, take the train instead of an airplane, eat vegetarian food, put solar cells on the roof etc. I claim that these schemes will do nothing to reduce carbon emissions. Lets say that a person owns a car that requires 200 liters of gasoline per month. They then replace it with a 100 liter gasoline per month. What will happen is that someone else will buy and burn the 100 liters that was saved. If we cut fuel consumption of cars in half the amount of cars would double or people would buy bigger lawnmowers or eat more meat. The fuel is still going to be used. The only way to reduce emissions is to leave fossil fuels in the ground. Currently we produce roughly 5 billion cubic meters of oil every year. As long as we produce that much oil co2 emissions won't decline. The only way to reduce emissions would be if the oil producing countries decided to reduce production by lets say 50 million cubic metersyear every year. This would create a shortage of oil and that would mean that people would find ways to use less oil. Trying to reduce your consumption while production stays the same just means the oil will be bought by someone else. Please change my view as I am not very optimistic about oil producing countries agreeing to leaving tens of billions of cubic meters of oil in the ground. Hello, users of CMV!
