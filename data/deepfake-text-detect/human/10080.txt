Redditors main real concerns about the website were monetization and the limiting of "free speech" in the rfatpeoplehate drama. Reddit has still brought many people on board independent of Huffman to help advance the site and create revenue. Further having money and people behind him will influence Huffman and his situation is very different from when he founded Reddit. In regards to "free speech" the subreddits that make Reddit the awesome website it is are all heavily moderated. The subreddits targeted were brigading other subreddits. The administration's views on hate speech won't change, they even said in their announcement that, If the reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion, it may be a great website but it will never be a truly great community. While there will be more communication on things like the Victoria firing Reddit is still headed in exactly the same direction. To be clear I am perfectly content with the monitization of reddit and don't see it as a big deal. Ellen Pao's hatred came from her being the face of Reddit that started the changes. People latched onto her lacking resume and questionable sexual harassment lawsuit to demonize her and transform her into everything that is wrong with Reddit. She is still working at Reddit, just not as the public face of the company. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
