Damn. Again. This is 36. I remember my first power. My bed caught fire and I started to freak out and realized I was immune to the fire. I was terrified. The fire didn't grow. It didn't spread. I started to calm down. The fire died down the calmer I got. I played for hours with my ability. It was awesome. A few days went by with nothing noticeable happening until I noticed I could warp plastic. Odd. I thought it might be a secondary effect of my heat powers. I kept it on the down low. After a week I had about 6 powers. It seemed every few days I was waking up with more and more powers. I was starting to lose track of all of them as 3 weeks had passed. The pattern seemed random until more and more time went by. I would discover 2 sometimes 3 new powers a day and such until I caught the pattern. I wasn't skipping days I just wasn't noticing the powers. Some were only noticeable during specific times. Hell it wasn't until a full moon that I discovered it made my toenails glow neon. Most of these powers were useless and some were devistating. The fire power could level a square block. I noticed that if my heart rate was above a certain level I would exhale hydrogen. I don't even need to explain that one for some of you. Hydrogen exhaled as a high heart rate and fire powers controlled by emotion? Bad combo. I blew up the local YMCA. 3 dead, 5 in critical condition. Only the people at the pool got away unscathed. Was this God? Maybe. I was never a religious man but who woulda thought super powers? My depression was finally at its end. Day 37 wasn't going to come. Everyone was in danger and the only superpower I had that made me a superhero was my will. I pulled out a gun and put it to my head. "Goodbye" BLAM "No..... No..... " I guess day 37 was going to come..... As would every day. I am the apocalypse.
