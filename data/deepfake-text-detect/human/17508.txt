I feel that the real victims are the ones they leave behind. I think it's a selfish act for a person to commit suicide because of the damage they leave behind. The personal problems and suffering they could have overcome and solved have now been passed onto the people who cared about them. Why should the family and friends carry a burden like that? It's ridiculous to cut a life short when you could have used it to produce positive things and even help other people who might have gone through what you've been through. So many terminally-ill patients and the sick would give anything to live a few more months, weeks, days even. There is SO many suicide hotlines and preventions and public sources to help provide comfort for people who are going through tough times, why just give up without giving it a try? We all have problems, what would make a person who commits suicide special enough to cause THAT much pain to your friends and family just cause they've been having a bad time. Suicide is a coward's way out, CMV.
