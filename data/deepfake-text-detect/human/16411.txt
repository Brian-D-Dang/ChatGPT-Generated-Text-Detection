The kinetic battery model is a popular model of the dynamic behavior of a conventional battery, useful to predict or optimize the time until battery depletion. The model however lacks certain obvious aspects of batteries in-the-wild, especially with respect to (i) the effects of random influences and (ii) the behavior when charging up to capacity bounds. This paper considers the kinetic battery model with bounded capacity in the context of piecewise constant yet random charging and discharging. The resulting model enables the time-dependent evaluation of the risk of battery depletion. This is exemplified in a power dependability study of a nano satellite mission.
