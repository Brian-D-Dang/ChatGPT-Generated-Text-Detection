We live in an imperfect world, where the law can never be perfect. An imperfect body of law can never grant perfect justice. Although perfect justice can never be achieved either, it is better to adhere to the ideal of Justice than to the ideal of Law, as law is the means to maintainobtain justice. Whenever the law is unable to grant justice it is right to seek it outside the law. At times, seeking justice through legal means can also be psychologically, professionally, personally or even physically damaging to the victim. Even if the law could grant justice in this hypothetical case, if it would cause more harm to the victim to use the law, it is right to seek justice outside of the law, and wrong to seek it using the law. Accordingly, when the law is not just, it is everyone's right (if not their obligation) to punish crimes extrajudicially. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
