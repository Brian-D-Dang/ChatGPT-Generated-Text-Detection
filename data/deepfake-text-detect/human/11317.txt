Researchers have discovered a new Linux backdoor called Symbiote that uses novel evasion techniques to conceal its presence. It is able to scrub any sign of infection from the file system, system processes, and network traffic. Symbiote was first discovered in November targeting financial institutions in Brazil. It provides the threat actor with remote access capability and other abilities. It is unlikely that the malware is widely active, but researchers can't be sure. More details about how Symbiote conceals its tracks are available in the article.
