Absolutely tasty!!! This place is one of the best Indian restaurants I've been to. There mixture of Indian, Tibetan and Nepal is a refreshing blend. The first time I went there I asked for paneer pakora which wasn't on the menu and the owner went to the kitchen and made me up a plate which tasted amazing. They have lots of beers from India and alot of lassi drinks. Just to prove my taste buds are on the level I recently brought a friend who's wife is from India and she said very tasty and top notch. Well worth it. Nice atmosphere as well.
