Granted, I went to this pool on a weekday...however, I was still not overly impressed with this venue. You would actually think service would be better when it's not busy. First off, we arrived with reservations for a daybed and we waited 20 minutes at the front entrance before being let in. (There was no line). Then our cocktail server was highly disinterested in serving us. Anytime she asked if we needed anything, if we debated for a second about what we wanted, shed'd say,I'll come back when you've decided. Then she would wander off like it was busy. The pool overall was pretty with a great view, but I have been to way better pools in Vegas. The drinks were very overpriced (way more than usual Vegas prices at 40-50 for a 32oz cup) and so was the food. It is a good experience at least once, but I wouldn't necessarily visit again.
