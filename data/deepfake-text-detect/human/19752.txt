Earlier today we passed the 50K mark, which is a tremendous milestone for our subreddit. On behalf of all the mods, I want to thank you all for making this subreddit the great place (we hope you agree with us) that it is. Consistently thought-provoking posts and challenging answers are the backbone of this community and are something that can only come from you, the members at large. This subreddit constantly exposes me to at least one new idea that I'd never even thought of and it forces me to reconsider and reform my own beliefssome of them deeply heldon an almost daily basis, something for which I am extremely thankful. I look forward to welcoming the next 50,000 members with you all. -DrM
