Reminded by [this post] , I believe the United States surface-based naval fleet is an aged-commodity past its time. Simply put, while I dont foresee an armed conflict with a modernized nation in the near future advanced cruise missiles (like the SS-N-22 Sunburn or SS-NX-26 Oniks) will certainly remain a threat making our surface fleet indefensible. We obviously need a launching platform for foreign missions however our current expenditure (184B or 27 of defense spending) seems too high for such vulnerable targets.
