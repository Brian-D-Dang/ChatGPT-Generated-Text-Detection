GitHub Actions is an API for cause and effect on GitHub. Developers can orchestrate any workflow, based on any event, and GitHub will manage the execution and provide rich feedback while securing every step along the way. After receiving feedback from developers, GitHub has implemented CICD for any OS, any language, and any cloud. GitHub Actions is currently in beta and will be generally available on November 13.
