I believe that Jack White is undoubtedly the most talented musician of those currently recordingperforming. He has found success with a wide variety of acts: The White Stripes, The Raconteurs, The Dead Weather, and his own solo material (of which a new album is due to be released in June). Jack White is a adept player of the guitar, piano, and mandolin. He has been a producer on every musical act he has been a part of. Despite all of the talent, achievements, and awards, I don't think Jack White gets the recognition that he truly deserves. Change my view. Hello, users of CMV!
