"What's a soul wrangler" "I need souls, you....acquire them for me" "I kill them you mean" "Sure, if you want to be so vulgar." "one person a year?" "That's the deal. You kill one person a year and you get to live forever" There was that cackling again. What's with the cackling? "Well..." "Well what?" "I just have a few questions first." "Ask away" "What if I kill 2 people one year does it carry over?" His eyes glowed red at this and he smiled wide. "An overachiever huh? Sure why not?" "Do I have to physically kill them or can I just be responsible for their death. Like let's say I get them to drink poison does that count?" "Absolutely! You kill them you get a year simple as that." "Last question." "What is it?" "Where do I sign" "So, you'll do it?" "I'll be the best damn soul wrangler you have ever seen, or my name isn't Ronald J. McDonald"
