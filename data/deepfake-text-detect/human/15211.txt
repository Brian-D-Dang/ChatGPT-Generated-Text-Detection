It's a small area, but big, beautiful sights to be seen. It changes so there is high replay value and between this and the Fountains you can spend a few hours doing something FREE and satisfying. For those into photography, this makes for great practice area. For those who just love taking family photos, this is a great photo op. I will say though that during the day it can get rather crowded so sometimes it'll be a wait before you can get your turn and have a clear shot, but most people are considerate enough to hold walking through if they see you are trying to capture a photo. You get a lot of nice natural sunlight through the glass ceiling, but if you don't mind night shots, it sometimes is very quiet depending on the setup. To me, the Chinese Year Year ones always look great at night whereas the spring one is best daytime. If you want to see all of the seasonal gardens, this is the schedule: 2013 Exhibit Calendar Chinese New Year Jan 12 - Mar 3 Spring Celebration Mar 9 - May 11 Summer Garden Party May 19 - Sep 8 Autumn Harvest Sep 14 - Nov 30 Winter Holiday Dec 6 - Jan 5, 2014 Between 5-6pm there are live musical performances from the Victorian Gazebo as well. If you're a flora nerd, apparently they do a QA with Mr. Ms. Green Thumb between 10:30am-11:30am. I would be interested to ask questions, but that is hella early for me! I'm always excited to see what they come up with. Sometimes animals and people are involved in the exhibit. My favorite was a rustic country springtime one with a a greenhouse full of butterflies. If you notice the gaps in the dates. I came once while they were transitioning and it was partially closed offunfinished areas. Tourist and locals come here and spend a day in Vegas finery without blowing a lot of cash! I come for the fountain show, the gardens and get a treat at Jean Philippe and realize half the day as gone by. (Yelp 100 Challenge 37100)
