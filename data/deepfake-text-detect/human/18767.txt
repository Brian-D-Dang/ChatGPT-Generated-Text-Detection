Socialism and Communism to me is defined as the state or a collective body taking control and ownership of property, means of production, and all assets in a drive to create a more egalitarian society. Never minding the reality of authoritarian regimes grow out of it, or anarchist ideals are inevitable, or social democracies being a good transition. Just the most basic idea behind Socialism and Communism. What gets me is the concept of equality here. Equality of results, not equality of opportunity. Equality of opportunity fundamentally comes down to the freedom of choice. You choose to seize the opportunities, or you choose to let it go in favor of other opportunities. Ultimately, you are responsible for your own successes and failures, and you aren't a victim except of your own choices. Equality of results fundamentally comes down to stripping away what the haves and use it to provide for the have nots. And it relies on the majority of people who are pretty much have nots, and telling them that it isn't their fault that they chose their lot in life, instead of encouraging them to improve their situation. Ultimately, treating them as victims of society, and not victims of their own ambition (or lack of). CMV. EDIT: Seems to be a small misunderstanding... What I want is to be shown, or explained to me that socialism and communism isn't solely dependent on the concept of the common man are victims. The merits, successes, failures of any economic system is not the topic. Simply the idea of Socialism Embracing Victim Identity vs Capitalism Embracing Power To Change.
