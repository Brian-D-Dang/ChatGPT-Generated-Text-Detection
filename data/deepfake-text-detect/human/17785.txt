I quoted "I" in the sentence because it's not me who believes this, it's one of my closest friends who does. He's a primitivist meaning that he prefers a life free of technology, wide-spread cites and agriculture. He strongly believes at this point in time that the idea of "saving" society is a foolish and ignorant one because its problems are too convoluted, complicated and pointless. He believes we've strayed too far from "our natural roots" and created far too many problems that can be solved efficiently and that we need some sort of revolution or disaster so that we can "start over." I've tried talking to him, but it seems I've failed. Anyone is welcome to reply. Edit: Spelling and grammar errors.
