Yes, exactly like that. A bit longer answer: ohm's law is more intuitive, V IR. In a batteryoutlet, you have a voltage differential that will push electrons through the wire that you connect them with; how many electrons go through is up to the resistance in the circuit. In a lightbulb you'll have a wire with more or less resistance to increase or decrease the current. The power equation is basically derived from ohm's law...
