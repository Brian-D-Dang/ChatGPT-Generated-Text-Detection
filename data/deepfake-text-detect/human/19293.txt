OP will no longer be responding to comments in this thread. First things first Idolatry: immoderate attachment or devotion to something. And since Idolatry is synonymous with Idolization Idolization: To love or admire to excess. In my (admittedly limited) ventures into mainstream churches, it seems to be a common practice for some people to kneel before a crucifix before they pray, some of these crucifix contain an image of Jesus, others do not. I feel that offering prayer before such an image in order to gain a special dispensation (indulgence) is directly in contrast to God's commandment in Exodus 20:4-5 You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me. Similar gripes with crucifix necklaces. Please, change my view. EDIT: First off I'd like to thank everyone for contributing, so thanks guys! Secondly, this CMV has opened my eyes to why people use a crucifix and why they believe it is acceptable. I still think that prayer via crucifix is a bit to idol-y for myself, however it isn't really my place to tell anyone else that they're loving God the wrong way. Once again, thanks for the discussion. OP out!
