I've read articles and heard arguments that state how schoolingeducation favours the elites or higher status families of societies. They say that schooling contributes to the reproduction of existing social hierarchies and that it unfairly acts as the only way to establish one's credibility or legitimacy. I simply look as schoolingeducation as a vehicle of opportunity. I myself am not from a elite or higher status family, but I still feel like schoolingeducation has created opportunities for me. At the moment, I can't see how schooling education can limit opportunities. CMV
