Presidents vary in their ability to manipulate Congress. Some are terrible at it, like Obama and Carter. Some are average like Reagan, Clinton and Bush. A few are masters like LBJ. The difference is understanding on a specific, person-by-person basis what it takes to get votes, and the willingness to do whatever is necessary to make that happen (even to the extent of making corrupt deals from time to time). All Presidents need leverage over Congress. Those who succeed figure out what that leverage is and how and when to use it. Those who don't end up complaining bitterly and endlessly about dysfunction and gridlock.
