Apparently it's become more of a problem as there are many online services (and even some major retailers) selling vestspapers that say "Service Animal" or "Companion Animal" even though that petowner team has no actual disability or training. They just want to bring their pets with them into restaurants, movies, etc. News articles [here] and [here] . I understand people love their dogs and want to take them with them or don't want to leave them at home, but I've met actual Service Animals through the MDA and they're very well trained (stay close and don't get underfoot, nor do they bark or jump up on you). They cost a lot of money to train and they do real work for their owners. The first time I encountered this was a couple of years ago when I was working at an upscale restaurant as a server and this older woman, (with no apparent disabilities) had a Toy Poodle with her that was wearing a vest that said "Service Animal." Unlike the other Service Animal Golden Retrievers I'd seen, this dog wouldn't stay close to her owner and in fact kept getting underfoot. While carrying trays full of food I almost tripped on it twice as it darted out from under her chair into the aisle. I notified my manager, but they shrugged and said, "What can I do? I can't ask for paperwork or tell her to leave?" Since then I've seen more examples of this and it annoys me: real Service Animals are probably getting a bad rap because of these selfish owners and there are online servicesretailers making money out of selling the fake vestspapers. If you can, CMV.
