on my birthday I got a pikachu and also a letter that said I was going to howgwarts. I was hella excited. the first thing I do was I put pikachu in a cage and force him to make a lot of electricity. then I use the wingardiam leviosa spell to make a hella lot of guitars and huge drumbs and a hella metal bass with spikes. then I can use the electricity to make them light up and play. I will have machamp on the drums because he has 4 arms and hella gnarly bicepts that are big. then I will put tentacle on the guitar because if you have tentacles you can make hella good music. then in the middle of the concert everyone will use the magic spells to make fire shoot out of their mouth. then I will become a pokemon master wizard rock and roll god.
