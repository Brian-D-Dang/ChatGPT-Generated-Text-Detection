I think I am superior to others, even though I have so many faults. I hate feeling better than other people but I really think I am sometimes. I try to disassociate myself from these people, but that ends up with me being alone (my friends and family are the main recipients of this). I feel so bad constantly; it really is ruining my life. I feel like an arsehole. I am nice to peoples faces, but a lot of the time i hate them just for being themselves. It also makes it very hard for me to have a relationship with women. I do try to be more accepting it just hasnt gotten me very far. Can somebody please change my view?
