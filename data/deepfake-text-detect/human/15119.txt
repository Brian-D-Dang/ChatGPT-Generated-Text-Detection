Normally LOVE Penn Station, but today was. Greeted by a gnat infestation my Penn Station. Sooo troubled by that! Please get rid of the gnats. I will be back at least once, but if I have to fight the gnats for a lid straw it will definitely be my last time. Totally willing to edit my review it fixed. I informed the guy behind the counter who was already aware and shared his knowledge of the gnat's resilience. I'm sure your not the first eatery to have to deal with this. Get a professional in there and save my favorite sandwich shop!
