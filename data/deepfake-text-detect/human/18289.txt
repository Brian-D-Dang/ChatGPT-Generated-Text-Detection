I've seen this view expressed over and over again - the idea that suggesting to not walk alone at night, carry mace, mind your surroundings, etc. is somehow "victim blaming" and that we should instead be "teaching rapists not to rape" or worse "teaching men not to rape." The first one seems ridiculously silly, and the second one is downright sexist. Regarding any other crime or danger, it is seen as perfectly reasonable to prepare for such a circumstance using preventative measures. Telling someone to mind their surroundings when they walk through a dangerous neighborhood (to prevent violence, theft, murder) is perfectly reasonable. Telling someone who is about to walk through a slum in Zimbabwe to hide their money isn't considered victim blaming. No one says "Why don't we teach the thieves not to steal!" or "Why don't we teach those Zimbabweans not to steal." There are bad people in the world. Ignoring common sense preventative measures and instead claiming that we should teach them not to be bad people anymore is naive and absurd. CMV. Edit: Thank you for everyone who has responded so far! Since I'm getting a lot of responses that I feel are arguing against something very different than what I'm saying, allow me to clarify a few things: 1.) Prevention, which I am advocating, contains the prefix "pre," meaning before. I am not advocating blaming a victim afterwards or suggesting they should have done something differently. This is simply about preparedness. If for some reason you advocated prevention educationtraining with blame, please explain yourself, as this is not a normal equivalency. 2.) When I say prevention, I do not mean absurd things like "don't wear xyz type of clothes." I mean self-defense, awareness of surroundings, and a better understanding of the crime of rape and how it occurs.
