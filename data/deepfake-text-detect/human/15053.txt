If I could give this ulta no stars, I would. The African American supervisormanager at checkout was extremely rude. Was on her headset while I was trying to ask her questions and when I finally got a chance to speak she was unknowledgable and unaware of sales. Everything was out of stock and when I tried to find a nude eyeliner one of the employees took me to one of the most expensive eyeliners. Found one on my own by NYX that was basically the same thing. All in all I wasn't satisfied with my shopping trip. Will be going to Sephora instead
