Variable tax, or at least they way the US does it, is poorly done, inasmuch as it often discourages extra labour from people who may very well need the extra cash in the form of extra taxation. I know that personally, my paychecks are taxed between 25 and 30, depending on overtime and the like, and it makes it feel so much more that instead of extra cash in my pocket, for going above the 40 hour work week standard, it's cash in the government's pocket. Of course, this might also be influenced by my somewhat libertarian leanings, in that I consider taxation in general an.... unnecessary evil. It's a fact of life I'll admit, but I don't think that it should be. Ultimately though, this post is concerned with the justification of a variable tax rate, inasmuch as how there is a justification for the government to take a larger percentage of your money because you earn more.
