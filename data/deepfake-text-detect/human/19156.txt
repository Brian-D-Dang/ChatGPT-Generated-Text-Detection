I see feminism as a sexist movement, as it indicates in the name. I have taken classes at university on feminism by a feminist instructor, and I've met several feminists. The premises of all of them are that I must WORK in order to not be scum (because I am male). They are no different from many extremist fundamentalist religions. For example: According to feminists, certain words are unforgivable, no matter what the context is used in. I believe that the majority of feminists are one of two things: (1) They have been raped before, whether or not they reported it, and their hatred for men and reason for joining the movement is entirely motivated by this emotional scarring. (This would explain their behavior when reacting to rape accusations and their extreme position against men and on the subject of rape.) (2) They crave attention to the point that they have a personality disorder.
