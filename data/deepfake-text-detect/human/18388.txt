I personally believe that the idea of White Privilege (basically that White people are the default standard for all societal norms, generally have an easier life and path to the top than non-whites, and that American society is crafted around White people, forcing non-Whites to adjust to White culture) trumps the idea of Cis-Male Privilege (the same thing, but replacing every instance of the word "White" with "cis-male. I am a Black, Cis-male. I hold this belief due to noticing the varying treatment of White women vs. Blacks, male or female. A few examples include: - The common "White woman clutches her purse when a Black man walks nearenters an elevator" scenario. - How the feminist movement tends to center around White women's needs instead of all women. (ex. shaming women who wear traditional head coverings as though they don't choose it) - The welfare queen stereotype only being applied to Black women, even though, by raw numbers, Blacks Whites are about even in terms of amount of people on welfare.
