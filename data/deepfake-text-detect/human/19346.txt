The entire economy is propped up by the purchase of trillions of dollars be the federal reserve. Since the beginning of quantitative easing, gas prices have gone up from 2 to 4. I believe this is caused by the devaluation of the dollar. A weak dollar can cause high oil prices. Thus in effect, while quantitative easing was meant to prevent the crowding out effect of investment (government stimulus policies depend on deficit spending, which constricts supply for private investment, by printing money, the intent of quantitative easing was to avoid this crowding out effect), it has crowded out all sectors of the economy. Because of our import dependency, a weak dollar simply makes the goods we purchase more expensive, straining limited budgets. Furthermore, quantitative easing has delayed the needed restructuring of the economy. Employers, cognizant on some level that it will end, and uncertain of the future, could potentially be delaying major hires until after quantitative easing is over. Additionally, quantitative easing has created a dependency on it, ending it will cause, in my mind, a recession, because M1 money supply was expanded by roughly one third.
