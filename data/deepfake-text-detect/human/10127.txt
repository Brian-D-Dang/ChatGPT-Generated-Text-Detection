For whatever reason men commit about 80-90 of crimes in every society that they exist in. The numbers get a little more equitable when we account for property crimes where men only outnumber women 2:1. However, white collar crimes, blue collar crimes, violent crimes, sexual crimes, etc. are so vastly male-centric that the numbers increase that much. They are both the overwhelming amount of perpetrators and victimized, though women are victimized significantly, as you'd expect, in intimate crimes and sex-related offenses. Aside from criminality, men are also more likely to be impulsive and aggressive which is likely to eliminate cohesion and cause undue caution due to the erratic, unpredictably violent and harmful action of this sub-group. Why does this persist? Why are men so much more criminal and violent? Does this have a tangibly negative effect on society? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
