Elon Musk has asked his Twitter followers to vote on whether he should sell 10 of his Tesla shares. The poll is a response to a proposed billionaires tax, which may see billionaires paying taxes on unrealized gains even if they do not sell any stock. Critics of the law argue that the value of assets does not always go up. Musk does not receive a cash salary or any bonuses, so the only way for him to pay tax is to sell stock. He has an option that expires in August next year to buy 22.86 million Tesla shares at 6.24 each.
