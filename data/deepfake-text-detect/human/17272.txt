I am not arguing that if police were to wear cameras that it would not have a positive effect, it might, it might not, I am not sure. However it is merely trying to treat one small part of a larger issue that needs to be addressed. From an external perspective, albeit from a country with very similar problems - the UK, the problem with the police and ethnic minorities, a large percentage being black, stems from deeper issues. Cameras may help bring down excessive force and other such activities from the police, but the actual issue stems from deeper issues such as inequality, the relationship with the state and individual that borders on egotism, to name just a few.
