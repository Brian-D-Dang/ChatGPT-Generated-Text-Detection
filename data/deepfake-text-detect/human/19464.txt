I feel like this is an incredibly common, cynical sentiment you read all over the Internet: "pfft I bet DiCaprio took a private jet and a yacht to get to the speech. Typical hollywood hypocrite. Climate Change is a farce." and rarely do I see anyone stick up for the obvious truth and put that argument to bed. Whether or not DiCaprio uses a jet has absolutely no bearing on whether or not Climate Change is a real problem. It has absolutely no bearing on whether or not he can speak on it. What, is he supposed to travel by hot air balloon? There is no hypocrisy, because no one is advocating the ban of private jets. No one is advocating that everyone must take a vow of poverty before they can be considered a credible advocate. The message is that POLICY needs to change. Big scale economic and global policy is needed, because the problem is trillions of times bigger than one guy and his yacht. I have never heard these guys advocate the ban of private jets. I've never heard them advocate the ban of yachts. I've never heard them say that every individual needs to take a vow of poverty. So, they are not hypocrites. Thus, attacking them personally for not being perfectly flawless examples of carbon-free lifestyles is clearly just attacking the messenger, setting up an unreasonable strawman, and trying to shut down the debate. It adds nothing constructive, does not have anything to do with the science itself or the validity of the message itself, it's a pure red herring. Hello, users of CMV!
