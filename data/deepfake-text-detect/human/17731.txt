I know this is a viewpoint that has been echoed several times throughout history but I think any intelligent person can see that This Time It IS Different: the Earth is facing irreversible degradation, climate change will drastically lower our quality of life, resources are growing scarce and the future of the world economy is incredibly uncertain. Any person who has biological children is doing said children an incredible disservice. They will inherit nothing but chaos and strife and their short brutish lives will end cursing the name of their parents as they die a slow painful death. And considering that most people have children for their OWN benefit, so THEY can have someone to love, to follow in THEIR footsteps, to follow an animalistic urge to spread THEIR DNA, the crime is magnified several fold. There is truly no ethical reason to make more children. As we speak there are hundreds of children out there wasting away in orphanages who need a home. They are already here so we might as well make their time here as enjoyable as we can before the inevitable. Yes adoption might be a long and arduous process but so is raising any child. If you can do one, you can the other. If you truly want a child to love, then you shouldn't be constrained by mere genetics.
