I had a good idea of what to expect, having had Laotian cuisine maybe once or twice in the past. I can't comment on the restaurant itself because my friend and I had our meals delivered. Upon its arrival (on time, btw), I realized there were two things I was not expecting: 1) The portion size. 11.50 gets you a LOT of food, more than a petite person can finish by herself in one sitting. You're looking at about two meals counting the rice. 2) The quality. My gut told me to order Tofu in Peanut Sauce with the lowest level of spiciness. My gut, as usual, did not steer me wrong. I regret that I wasn't able to take the leftovers with me (long drive home with no insulated bag), but the memory of that sweet and delicious food will live on!
