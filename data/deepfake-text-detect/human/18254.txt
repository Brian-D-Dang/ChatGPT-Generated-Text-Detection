Grade is often measured on participation, and what can seem repetitive, boring, or rudimentary work to some. I believe this does not accurately display ability or understanding, but only displays an intent to understand. This grade curve caused by this repetitive work and participation is meant to help most students, not hinder. Yet unlike what many would have you believe, there are exceptions. This system can in fact harm a student's grades and other's perceptions about their intellectual capability. While some students may require to do these kinds of tasks in order to learn, many could have opportunity to learn more about subjects they're interested in if they were able to use that free time. But I would go even a step further than that. Regular exams are very important no doubt, they do summarize sections of what is covered in a course. But those exams are specific to a selective time period. I do not believe that students necessarily have to know material within a given time frame as long as they understand it by the end of the course. The central idea of a final is to summarize all the material that has been covered during a course. If a student successfully summarizes all the material within the course, I believe they should be treated as a student who understands the material, not as one who doesn't. For example: If a student has an overall 'F' in the class and get's an 'A' on a course's final, they should unquestionably pass the class. If anyone is curious, I am an American and have been apart of the public education system. I have attended a private university, but have since transferred into a public university.
