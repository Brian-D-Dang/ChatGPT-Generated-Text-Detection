Im in grade 12. I'm failing miserably in all of my classes. I'm missing 8 credits, possibly more. I can't see things getting any better with schoolwork, I've even tried taking Adderall to help with my attention, but it only highlighted the real problem with my performance and it has everything to do with my learning style, not attention. Here in Canada, I must be 18 and out of school for a whole year before I'm eligable for the test. I am 17, I turn 18 in November. I feel like I should drop out ASAP so I can be eligible sooner. My grades have always been terrible, and I already have no hopes of getting into university right out of Highschool, so I'm aiming for college, GED or not. I just want to stop. I can't get through this system, and I feel like no matter what, my very near future is going to be bleak. I would rather take the less stressful way out. My post-highschool plans have forever been get out, get a shitty job, save up for college, attend that, then move on to university to study literature or psychology. Also, I am working towards speaking a second Language, and I am a certified PROTON food handler (restaurants specifically try to have PROTON-heavy staff to avoid food inspector visits). So I will have a semi-strong resume. I'm here so that I can iron this huge decision out as much as possible. I've researched why I SHOULD get my GED, but I want to make sure all the cons are addressed. This seems like the place to go.
