You might need to explain yourself better. What the heck do you mean by "un-sharpen" and where are you seeing this term? What's the question?','Blurring the screen a bit helps with sharp edges. For example. Letters on a screen should look rounded but they can appear to sharp and pixelated making it look awkward and annoying. Blurring the screen is a quick and easy way to mimmick slightly the effect of anti aliasing. It will soften sharp edges but blur everything else.
