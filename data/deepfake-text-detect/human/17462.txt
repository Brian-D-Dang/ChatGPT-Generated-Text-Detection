I think tipping is ridiculous and this is why. I had a conversation with a guy. Basically he stated in his post that tourists are expected to tip so I did some math. He waits on average 45 tables a day. He receives on average 10 per table. 10x45 is 450. He works six days a week, 450 by 6 2,700 a week in tips. He said this is during his busier months which is 3 months and usually makes up half his annual year. 21 weeks by 2700 is 56,700. Makes up roughly half his year. soo he makes 100,000 roughly in tips He is an unskilled waiter. How can anybody justify this? Change my view. Edit: It seems the major argument is that 1. Majority don't make anything near it. 2. It is cheaper for the customers and keeps waiters working hard I disagee with both of those, even if one or two make anything near that much it's still a system that doesn't work. Raise the min wage. What about all the other min wage employees? Are we going to leave tips hidden under the couch in a hotel lobby so that the lobby cleaner gets some of his well deserved tips? He is most likely min waged but because he doesn't serve customers directly, he doesn't get a tip? If a waiter doesn't do well, fire him. Decide another way how to select better employees. Even out the cost of a meal and pay your employees properly and you'll get employees who don't need a tip to do a good job. Even though you don't have too, it is still pressured to tip.
