With the most recent episode of Last Week Tonight making its way to the front page, I've been introduced to the idea of civil forfeiture. Based on the clip, it seems pretty cut and dry that it's too easy to abuse and is an absurd practice that should be changed dramatically. However, it seems too obviously wrong based on the video for that to be the whole story, and I'm always skeptical when I hear outrageous anecdotes like the ones in the clip. I am interested in hearing arguments as to why it's a thing, and what's stopped people from trying to change it. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
