Recently in class, I've noticed one of my professors seems to have an almost overly negative view of immigrants getting attending institutes of higher education here in America, and proceeding to return to their countries of origin to start companies there. He refers to the "brain drain" as a failure for American enterprise, and states that we're losing valuable human capital in STEM immigrants moving out of the country to conduct business. My issue with this is; how can this be considered a negative aspect when this country is struggling to employ its BAs and MAs as is? These immigrants go back to other countries and start companies, but these also become trading opportunities, and contacts formed in the US help to bring their business back this way. Having said that, shouldn't people be happy that the competition for jobs in this country isn't being further tampered with?
