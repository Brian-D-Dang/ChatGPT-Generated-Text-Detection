I am a libertarian on most issues, but on this particular one I am in favor of more government involvement. I do not have a particular stance on whether it should be at the stare or federal level. Obviously, our current system needs some work but the concept is ideal in my opinion. We all have a general agreed-upon sense of what is considered a "good education" i.e. science, history, math, literacy, computer skills, etc. Because of this, it makes more sense for the government to provide an education to kids K-12 to keep everyone on the same page, and after that they can do whatever they want (college, join the work force, etc.) I think that a market system for schooling would have some damaging results, such as: Kids being forced to leave their school if their school goes out of business (this would disrupt their education and social life) Schools teaching what's in their best interest, if they are owned by a corporation. This would cause the kids' education to take a back seat to monetary interests. A person's education is too important to risk. Religious influence is rampant in a lot of public schools we see now. If they can get away with teaching kids that evolution is a myth and that creation theory is acceptable as fact, they are lying to children.
