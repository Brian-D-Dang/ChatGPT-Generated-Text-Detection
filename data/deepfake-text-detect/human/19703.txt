Scientology is not literally based on Hubbard's book or belief in aliens whatsoever. It's more likely a social club through which to filter money for unknown causes. (Charity? Clandestine funding of career propagating projects?) It only accepts successful people into closer circles who vow to keep that reality a secret under the guise they present to the general public for their own entertainment. I hold that it's simply unreasonable to assume that so many successful, intelligent people actually believe that a spaceship will take them somewhere if they cleanse enough whatevers from their bodies. Scientology is actually a very inside joke, that perhaps L. Ron was in on. If anyone has any other real information, I'm absolutely open to having my view changed.
