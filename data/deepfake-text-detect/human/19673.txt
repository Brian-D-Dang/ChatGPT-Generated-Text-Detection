Morality...good vs. evil...right vs. wrong...these concepts have plagued humanity since we became conscious of ourselves. As a current example, what is your stance on abortion? The death penalty? Illegal immigration? Chances are you are either for or against, but I would imagine the more intellectually minded of would respond with "What are the circumstances?" In the case of abortion, would your stance change if the pregnancy could kill the mother? Would you change your stance on death penalty if it was that of a man who broke into your home and raped your wife or child? Does your view of 'illegal immigration' change when you realize they just want a 'better life?' Apply these questions to yourself, analyze them, think on them. In the presence of intense scrutiny by logic and reason, good and evil become non-factors. Using arguments from morality turn what should be an objective debate into blind subjectivity, and bring progress to a halt. This is why I believe that reason and logic are the true means to justice and morality is but a mere facade. Edit: Well, this has been such an interesting discussion that I am having difficulty concentrating on my research. Thank you all for your participation, some of you helped me discover new angles of analyzing the question. Enjoy your days!
