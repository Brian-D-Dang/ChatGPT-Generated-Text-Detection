The bottom line is that you can't beat thermodynamics. No matter how hypo your thyroid is, or how badly your genes try to make you overweight, it is still possible to maintain a healthy lifestyle and stay thin. Anyone who is overweight and uses medical issues or family genetics as an excuse are simply giving up when the going gets tough. I will admit that medical issues make it more difficult to lose weight, but since when is giving up an acceptable response to an increase in difficulty? People who are overweight are a burden on the healthcare system and are doing everyone else a disservice. Worst of all, their premature demise caused by poor health is going to have a negative impact on their familychildren. I believe that every obese person should be actively and honestly trying to lose weight until they reach an acceptable level, or be looked at as a bum of society. Am I wrong? If so, change my view.
