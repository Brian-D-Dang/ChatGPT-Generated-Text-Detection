I don't have any current ocular issues (aside from astigmatism). They are L: -9.5, R: -9.0. This means that I can't function without my glasses or contacts- for all intents and purposes I'm blind without them. As an active rock climber and runner, I'd find replacing my contacts (which I hate) convenient, but have my skepticisms. I've been hesitant to indulge because most LASEK surgeries will cost 2500eye, according multiple evaluations at 4 different laser surgery centers. My insurance will only pay for 15 (pre-tax ). I'm saving up to go to MBA in about 4 years, and am not sure getting LASEK now would be a wise investment. I'm also hesitant because I've heard anecdotes from friends who've had LASEK (not LASIK) that, about 2 months1 year after their surgery, they went from an average 1.01.0 back down to about 0.20.3 ish. Still pretty damn good, but makes me suspicious about the quality of the treatment. I've heard that people experience dry eyes constantly, and am afraid that it may imply bigger problems when I get old. Lastly, I heard LASEK (not LASIK) hurts like a mother the first day or two. CMV!
