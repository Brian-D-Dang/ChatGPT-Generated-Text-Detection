First of all: hello CMV. I've been lurking for quite some time and finally felt that I should make this post. On-topic: Currently, I believe that forcing every citizen to vote is a good thing. My country (Belgium) does this. If you don't vote you can get serious fines. I believe this is the only way to make sure the elected are rightfully representing their nation and its citizens as a whole. I feel it forces politicians to do good for the nation, instead of just a single group. Also, I believe it acts as a safeguard against smaller, extreme groups, whose members are very motivated when it comes to voting. Adding to that, I feel that every person should be obligated to vote, simply because so many people died and fought for this right. You hear the occasional politician speaking out against this form of voting in Belgium, but I personally cannot comprehend why anyone would want to remove this system. So I turn to you CMV, enlighten me! I don't know if you'll actually change my view, but I would like to know why some of you think voting should be a choice and not a duty.
