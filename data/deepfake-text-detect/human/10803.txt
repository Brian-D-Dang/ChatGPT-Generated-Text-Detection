It depends on when you normally go to bed. Your body gets accustomed to going to bed and waking up at the same time if you make a routine out of it. I personally don't sleep well before midnight, and I just lie there contemplating life until I fall asleep a couple hours later. Also, since more of your time asleep might be when there's daylight (openthin blinds), you might get a lower quality sleep.
