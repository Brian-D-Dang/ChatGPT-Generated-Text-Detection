I don't think it should be the role of government to protect people from their own stupidity. For example, if someone wants to ride a bicycle or motorcycle without a helmet or ride in a car without a seat belt, that should be their right. Note however that I specifically mean laws that only protect someone from their OWN stupidity. I still think that it should be illegal to drive while talking on a cell phone or with an unrestrained animal (Such as your little dog) in the car, because those people are driving distracted which could case them to crash into an innocent bystander. I think society would be better off if the type of person that doesn't wear a seat belt or helmet would just die off. Change my view.
