he says "98 of humanity has lived since Christ...Almost every facet of your current life - right down to our language, healthcare, and education, has been influenced by that book. Our educational system was based off the church, our healthcare the same, our art was commissioned by it, our sciences advanced by it. Currently 2 billion people adhere to it, and the majority of social changes were sparked by it. The modern world has been touched by Christianity more than any other influence. Nearly all ancient societal norms were affectively destroyed by Christianity right down to their holidays which were converted upon the conversion of the pagans themselves."
