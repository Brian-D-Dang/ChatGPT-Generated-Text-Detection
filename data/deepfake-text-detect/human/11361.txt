Virgilio aims to help others navigate through the wide amount of information available on the internet and provide a clear and complete organic learning path for several tools, fields, skills, and more. Information is concise and hierarchically ordered by level of complexity, and there are hands-on projects to help consolidate the information and theories that are learned. No previous knowledge is required, but confidence in programming and high school level maths will help comprehension and understanding. All resources are free or open source.
