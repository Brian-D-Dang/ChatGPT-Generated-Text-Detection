Just about every Liberal Pundit this week has insisted that Syria isn't Iraq and Obama isn't Bush - as if Obama is acting better. Bush went to congress to get permission for Iraq and Afganistan. Obama told congress he didn't need permission for Libya, and was about to do the same (and still could) in Syria. Bush laid out clear goals and a plan that was intending to remove the problematic dictator or regime and set up a democracy. Powell at the UN is a prime example of laying out his evidence. Obama insists that his evidence in Syria is conclusive, but hasn't presented it. Insists his goal isn't to remove the regime (He said that in Libya at the outset too.) but to stop WMDs from being used. I'm still not sure how that works with leaving the guy who used them in power. Bush took responsibility for his actions and helped to rebuild the countries he destabilized. Successful or not, enough troops or not, at least he made the effort. Obama left Libya 1 week after a US drone blew up gadaffi's motorcade and promises he'll do the same in Syria. No kidding Obama isn't Bush. That fact is clear. What isn't clear is the idea that Obama's "Non-War" bullshit is a more responsible idea. Please, CMV.
