Unless, of course, in the indirect way that praying for someone helps strengthen the resolve of the person doing the praying to actually help the person they are praying for, when the opportunity to do so arises. Or that praying makes the person doing the praying a better person, which in a broadgeneral sense makes the world a better place which is beneficial for other people living in it. But I'm thinking about prayers for specific people or specific groups of beingspeople. Can anyone offer a good reason to think that such prayers have an effect on their subjects? Are there any studies or statistics about this? Thanks for taking your time to cmv.
