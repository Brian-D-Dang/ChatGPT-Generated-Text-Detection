I've been plotting and planning to summon, The darkest, most evil of things, I want to summon the devil, In hopes that a bike, he will bring. nbsp; My mum and my daddy are too broke, And Santa's the biggest cheapskate, I'm praying that Satan will come through, If he doesn't I'll be quite irate. nbsp; With candles lit and pentagram drawn, It was all according to plan, But instead of summoning Satan, I summoned this idiot Stan! nbsp; When the smoke cleared out he looked at me, I could tell he was just as confused, He clearly wasn't the one that I wanted, And for that, my ego was bruised. nbsp; A dirty housecoat on and hair a mess, A toothbrush still jammed in his mouth, This wasn't the man I was hoping for, It was clear that my plan had gone south. nbsp; "Where the hell am I?" asked the man, As he glanced around the room, His mouth was full of toothpaste, My face turned from shock to gloom. nbsp; "I want a bike." I proclaimed to him pointedly, And the man just stood with a grin, "I am Stan, not the man you are looking for." He mumbled this to my chagrin. nbsp; As he left my house I wondered, How and why this error occurred, The spell was pretty simple, I made sure I followed every word. nbsp; I checked it again and I saw my mistake, A simple missing "a," So I tried it again and got my bike, And my parents went up in flames. nbsp; The moral here is pretty clear, And I think you should take heed, If you ask for what you want, Then, you shall receive.
