A Florida-based unmanned trucking company, Starsky Robotics, has set a record for the fastest that an unmanned truck has driven on a public road. It hit 55 MPH in a speed test on the Selmon Expressway outside Tampa. Building a driverless truck that can handle highway speeds could solve a 726 billion dollar problem in the trucking industry. Starsky's trucks aren't completely autonomous. Instead, they have a remote driver that controls the trucks between freight depots and the freeway, after which an automated system takes over. Truck drivers are increasingly harder to find as the work hours and conditions are unappealing, and employees have to stay away from family for long periods of time.
