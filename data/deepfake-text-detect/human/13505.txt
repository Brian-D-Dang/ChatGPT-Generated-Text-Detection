Daniel loves filling the bird feeders at his home. He enjoys seeing the wide variety of birds that they attract. The birds glare at him through the window if they are not fed. When he fills the feeders, the birds alert their friends by chirping. After fresh food is supplied, Daniel loves seeing them so happy.
