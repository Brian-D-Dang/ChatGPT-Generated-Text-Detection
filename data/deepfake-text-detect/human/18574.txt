Definition: the action of making use of and benefiting from resources. For example: EDIT: THIS EXAMPLE HAS BEEN EXPLAINED THAT IT IS NOT EXPLOITATION I have a younger sister. When I was around 10 or so, I came up with this great idea of playing "servant." I told my sister that she could play with me, all she had to do was get and do whatever I wanted whenever I rang the little bell I had. And she agreed, she got me a glass of water, changed the tv station, did jumping jacks, whatever I said. This game would usually last about between 30 min and an hour until she got bored or I didn't have anything else to ask for. My sister willingly agreed to play this game several times before it lost its spark and she didn't find it that fun anymore. My point is I exploited her to get what I wanted, but at the same time, I didn't cause any harm. I think that's okay, because while it is still exploitation, one person benefited and the other person was neither benefited nor harmed. Now to be clear on what I mean by harmed or hurt. Definition Hurt: To cause pain, injury or stress Definition Harm: Physical or mental damage or injury: something that causes someone or something to be hurt, broken, made less valuable or successful, etc. The last thing is its important to not lie to the person. I will give the example of Tom Sawyer. He had to go paint a fence, which he did not want to do. So he saw his friend walking down the street and Tom acted like he was having sooo much fun painting that fence, that his friend wanted to join him. His friend ended up painting the fence only to find out it was not as fun as Tom said it was. In this case, Tom lied. He said it was fun, but it was not. However, if Tom was legitimately having fun painting the fence and told his friend so, I would not have an issue with this.
