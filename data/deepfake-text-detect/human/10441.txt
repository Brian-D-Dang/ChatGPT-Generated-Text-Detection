A magazine is a box that feeds rounds of ammunition into the action of a semi-automatic or fully-automatic firearm. It may be fixed (non-detachable) or detachable. If it's detachable, it can be removed and swapped quickly for a full one. It typically includes a spring or spring-powered mechanism to push the cartridges of ammunition into the firearm's action as the action cycles. A clip cannot feed ammunition into the action of the gun. It simply holds the ammunition in the same orientation, allowing the ammunition to be loaded quickly into the gun. A clip is typically used to load a fixed magazine. Round "full moon" or "half moon" clips can be used to load the cylinders of revolvers, where the revolver is designed to accept such.
