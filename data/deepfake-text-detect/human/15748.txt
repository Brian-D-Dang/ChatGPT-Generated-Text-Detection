Ah wish this wasn't the case. It is a nice little spot and decently priced for a known chef stop in Vegas. I love him maybe that made my expectations too high or something. I got the gruyere with grilled onions and shared a salad. The salad options are insanely bland but the dressing was good at least. My sandwich was flavorless except for the fennel seeds in the bread which I wish I had been warned about since I'm not a fan of fennel. Very disappointed. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing?
