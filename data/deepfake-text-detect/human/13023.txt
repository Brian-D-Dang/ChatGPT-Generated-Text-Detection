"Did you really think I wouldnt notice you building a robot in my fecking garage?" "No Tom, I dont think. However I did compute the probablity of you finding out, about me building a Robot, to be 70,105." Robot-Hitler stood up and waited for his creators decision. He wouldnt be able to oppose his creator anyways, but he didnt want to get more restricted in his choices, so not being too technical and confuse Tom was the best option. "Damn I thought I had programmed you better. You shouldnt be taking such a high risk," Tom started searching for his laptop - robot adapter. "I was programmed to take the course of action with the best endresult and not to avoid all risks." "Huh?" Tom looked at Robot-Hitler again, waiting for a better explanation. "I calculated the risk that you discover my actions to be 70,105, however I also calculated the risk that you would then shut me down to be less than 0,001 and the risk that you would restrict my own autonomous decision making to be 4,242 since both of these actions would mean work for you." "Ohh. That's good so I dont have to repair the decision making module. What did you want to build a robot for anyways?" Robot-Hitler knew he had won "For the same reason you built me: Working, especially in close proximity to multiple furnaces, is not a very entertaining activity." After thinking about it for a moment Tom threw his magnetic screwdriver back into the box and went back inside: "You can build your own robot, but after you are done come to the gaming room. I need a new healer anyways since William stopped playing, because of his annoying girlfriend"
