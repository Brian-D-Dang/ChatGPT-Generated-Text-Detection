I had only used my gift once. I was about 12 and what kid didn't snoop through their patent's things? The odd rubber batton seemed like an interesting object. I still remember the screaming, long ragged screams like a dieing animal. Those googly eyes were supposed to be silly but in that moment I saw nothing but a psychotic fear so visceral that I started screaming myself. I threw the batton across the room and his eyes popped off as it jiggled to the floor. He was finally silent. I will never use my gift again. If your walls could talk, would you be ready to hear all the horrible truths they have to tell you?
