"So Mr. Peterson. Tell me and the rest of the world. Are the rumors true that where ever you go, death actually follows?" "Kath, you can say that." "Why? Like, why does death follow you?" I thought about my answer for a second. The old man that gave me the saying died after I repeated it. Am I really going to do this? I looked back on the past month. I was on a camping trip when I went outside to do nature's business and saw a light. I followed it, and don't remember much of what happened next. When I woke up, I was in a chamber, hanging from the ceiling. My shoulder hurt like hell. Honestly, it never healed. Just stayed in pain. Anyway, my finger was bleeding, and the old man was staring at me. In his hand was a piece of paper glowing red. "The blood of a mortal has tied the plague to you," he said, as more and more blood dropped onto the paper. "This saying is now bound to you. Say it, and everyone who hears it, but you, dies." I looked down at the blood. Oh no. Blood. I fainted. Most of what happened next was a blur as well. EDIT: sorry I hit submit. Carry on reading. Most of what happened next was a blur as well. I woke up with a slip of paper in my pocket reading "Death Shall Follow you Wherever Life may Take You. " "Mr. Peterson?" The reporter asked as she tapped my shoulder. I screamed in pain, and fell to the ground. They were still filming me. "DEATH SHALL FOLLOW YOU WHEREVER LIFE MAY TAKE YOU!" I screamed, as all of Times Square dropped dead. I thought about what I just did. I was responsible for the death of not only the people in Times Square, but millions of people watching the news as well. I had to run. Anywhere. Just away. Maybe find someone to pass on the curse. I don't know. Just..... Run...
