My husband and a few of his close friends tried this place for lunch one day and had a great lunch! He was so pleased with his experience he wanted to take me there for dinner. We started with calamari which was so greasy we could hardly eat it. The pieces were literally dripping with grease. For main course I ordered the special of the day which was seared ahi tuna. It was charred and totally cooked thru. It was more like a tough steak than a piece of fish. I sent it back and ordered the salmon instead. The salmon was burned as well and so salty it was inedible. Needless to say we left and had to eat elsewhere. The bright light is the service. Friendly and attentive! The staff made an awful dining experience somewhat tolerable. Needless to say I won't be dining again here unless things really change in the kitchen!
