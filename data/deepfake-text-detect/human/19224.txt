I believe corruption is so rampant that there is no conceivable way to fight it on a large scale. There are far fewer people willing to fight corruption (or, alternatively, with the ability to fight it) versus those who are corruptible. The risk for fighting corruption is too high and the reward for being successful in eliminating it is too low. Entities with plenty of money and power are able to easily hide their corruption to the masses, or layer it so deep that it's nearly impossible to prove. Meanwhile, those with less money yet still wielding lots of power are more blatantly corrupt. Wealthier governments and private interests have been great at using things like [marketing strategies] and [salami tactics] on citizens to create a [creeping normality] that has turned corruption into something that the majority of citizens in societies just accept. Poorer but still powerful entities simply use bullying tactics to force those below them on the ladder to accept more obvious corruption. As a political example, I don't believe elections in most wealthy countries themselves are necessarily rigged or corrupt directly (in terms of actual vote counts), but [various processes of influencing voters] or the [creation of unnatural political advantages] is definitely corrupt. Fundamentally, I see no difference between these examples and the recent [North Korean elections] . One is simply creating the illusion of having a choice but not really having one, and the other is just blatantly not having a choice. And this doesn't even touch on the cronyism, nepotism and backroom dealings of politics and everyday business.
