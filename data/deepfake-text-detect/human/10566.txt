We are a very outdated model of human being. The last meaningful evolution of our species occurred tens of thousands of years ago when we were hunter gathers who spent a ton of calories during our daily strugglesearch for food. Your food travels through an upper and lower intestine, and finally your bowels before being expelled. The "am I hungry?" sensors are located in the early parts of that system, because again, life was a constant struggle to find enough food, so we had to ensure a constant stream of incoming nutrition. Your lower intestinebowel may be full of shit, but if your stomach is empty you're body is signally that you need to add more food to avoid breaking the chain of incoming nutrition.
