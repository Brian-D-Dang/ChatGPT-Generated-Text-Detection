Ratings of pretty much anything (whether its movies or only retail products) can often be misleading when the overall "rating" is completely different from the ratings of the most legitimate reviews. Look at the ratings of the Hunger Games movies on IMDB for instance. They all have ratings in the 710 range which usually means they are very good movies. But when you go look at the user reviews you will see that the majority of the most-agreed-with reviews give the movies low to mediocre scores, much lower than the 710 stars these movies seem to have. This is really misleading. I believe the give more weight for the most helpful or agreed reviews of movies or products by treating every user who agrees with a particular review's rating as additional votes of that same particular rating. ex. a 310 review for a product with 100 people agreeing with this review should count as 101 different "310" ratings A review with 100 agreements from 100 users should not have the same weight to a score as a really late review that sits all the way in the back of the pile of reviews that no one has read or agreed with. Overall ratings need to be more representative of legitimate reviews instead of simply the majority. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
