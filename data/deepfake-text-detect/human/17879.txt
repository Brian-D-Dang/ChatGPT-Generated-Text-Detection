As of Black and White 2, there are 649 Pokemon and this number will further expand in a couple of weeks once X and Y is released. Because of this, there's too much stress on the designers to keep coming up with new original Pokemon concepts, and I don't think this is sustainable at this rate. This wouldn't be a problem if it were a game series that's supposed to end at some point, but this being one of Nintendo's flagship series, the idea is to continue with new Pokemon games for as long as possible. I don't believe they have to make that many new Pokemon every new generation, though. There are so many Pokemon now that simply cycling through the older ones will already be fairly exciting for newer players and nostalgic for older ones. I'm not saying they have to stop making new Pokemon altogether, only that they can afford to make a lot less of them.
