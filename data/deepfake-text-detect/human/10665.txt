Animals do, in fact, get cavities. Here's a [picture of a piece of otter skull] (URL0) showing some cavities. The incidence is likely a bit lowered because many animals' teeth get clean by the food they eat. Chewing on bones and sinew, for instance, helps to keep teeth clean. Other animals have a different solution. Sharks, for instance, shed their teeth and constantly replace them. We brush our teeth because we've discovered what causes cavities, and how we can prevent them using tools that have been developed and perfected over many tens of thousands of years.," "Humans didn't need to start brushing their teeth until they started eating and drinking large quantities of refined sugar in their diet. Cavities are still possible without that, but our sugar intake is what makes it absolutely mandatory in modern times.," "Modern human diets aren't particularly good for teeth, also, if you lose 5 teeth by the time you're 50 it's not going to kill you. It's just damned inconvenient, and fixing all of the cavities you get from not brushing and flossing costs money. In animals, as with people, if you have bad teeth, well, you have a harder time eating. In predatory animals that means you die, in ones that can cope on alternate foods it just makes life more difficult. Teeth are basically just exposed bone. Expose them to acids, or otherwise muck with the pH in your mouth, supply the bacteria that cause cavities enough sugar and you'll wreck them. But if you don't do those two things teeth can, on the whole, be good for a lot of years. Of course that's also why we have a lot of them, if some fail you can keep going.
