Definitely over rated and over seasoned. And what I mean by that is EVERY item we received was seriously over-salted. We had the falafel hummus app. Seriously over-salted. The butternut squash tortelli would have been good if smaller for an appetizer, but as a main course the taste and consistency were too much. The filling was exactly the consistency and taste of a soggy amaretto cookie, which was the main flavor. The flavor was overwhelming after 3 torts. I had a special which I don't remember what it was called but it was chicken, pancetta, a cream type sauce and a fine, almost clear pasta. Again it was overwhelmed with salt. I know pancetta can add that saltiness, but not to this extreme. And the pasta was all stuck together. They weren't individual strands, but stuck clumps. Funny thing (not really) is, the couple right next to us had the same issue with saltiness with their meal and had one taken off of their check. The one positive was that they continued to fill our water glasses as we needed that to get through the meal.
