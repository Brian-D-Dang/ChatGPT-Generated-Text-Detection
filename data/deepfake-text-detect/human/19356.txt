These people are definitely "victims," but in my opinion, referring to them as "survivors" is in many cases overly dramatic. They might be referred to as "survivors" if their lives legitimately came into jeopardy (if they were held at gunpoint, if they were severely physically assaulted, etc.), but most instances of rape (unwanted sexual advances isolated to a single instance) do not come attached with a serious possibility of death. Rape is definitely one of the worst things that can happen to somebody, but I think that "survivor" suggests that what happened to them was on the same level as living through a genocidal campaign, a terminal illness, a plane crash, or something else of the sort. The former is bad, but the latter are almost certainly worse. Rape victims calling themselves "survivors" takes attention away from more serious issues in which death is on the line. Again, rape is a very serious issue, but not as serious as issues that consistently result in death. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
