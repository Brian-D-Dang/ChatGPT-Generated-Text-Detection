I think the money could do better elsewhere, per say, education? I am against war in general, so my view is a bit biased, but I still think that the military being the second highest funded program in the US is unnecessary. Building up our military, to me, is showy and is down just to try to scare away other countries from wanting to attack us. I think the reason anybody has hard feelings against the US in the first place is because we are asserting our power in places where it is to needed to be. The US would also much rather blow someone's brains off than reason with them.
