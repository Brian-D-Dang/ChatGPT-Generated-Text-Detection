I believe that eating other intelligent creatures is not cannibalism. I believe that eating any non-human no matter the level of intellect is by definition non cannibalism because the other intelligent creature is of a different species than humans and cannibalism is defined as eating your own species. (edit) for semantic reasons: Anthropophagy is defined by wikepedia as the custom and practice of eating human flesh. Cannibalism is defined as the practice of eating the flesh of your own kind. While these two may overlap they are not identical, a wolf eating another wolf is a cannibalistic wolf, but not an anthropophageus one. Similarly a wolf eating a human is a anthropophageus one but not a cannibalistic wolf. In a fantasy setting with multiple races of at least human levels of intelligence such as elves, goblins, kobold, orcs, and aliens, ect, I believe that a human eating the corpses of these other races would not be considered an act of cannibalism because the races the human is eating are of a different species. Several other people I have spoken with disagree with that view. They contend that eating other intelligent beings would be considered cannibalism even though they are not the same species. To sum up this CMV. Eating Legolas or E.T would not be a cannibalistic act. Change my view? (edit) Bonus level question (s): Is the eating of these other race's corpses an immoral act if it is not cannibalism? if so why?
