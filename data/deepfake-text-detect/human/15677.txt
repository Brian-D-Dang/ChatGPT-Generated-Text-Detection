I went to dinner with a friend and ordered the jumbo shrimp scallops. When the plate arrived, it had THREE scallops and FOUR medium shrimp - not jumbo at all and I asked the waiter to send over the manager. I asked her if they skimped on this order of so few scallops and shrimp for such a HUGE price and she said this was the standard order. I told her to take away this order and bring me an appetizer of bang bang shrimp, which was good, that I had for my dinner. There is absolutely NO value for your money at this restaurant and I was so surprised that people in this town like to pay for so little food at such a HUGE price. Hard to believe this restaurant is still open. I do not recommend this restaurant at all.
