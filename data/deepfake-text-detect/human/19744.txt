I think that international law is a misnomer because a country can simply ignore treaties, and the only consequences are those that other countries choose to impose rather than a predictable and enforceable sanction by an independent central authority. For example, the US refuses to accept ICJ authority over its citizens. Many states routinely ignore UN resolutions. Countries breach trade treaties all the time, and while there are certainly consequences in the form of damaged relationships, sanctions and the like, there is no irresistible penalty or punishment that can be given. In civil law, parties can bring a dispute before a court which will determine the outcome and enforce it. . Conversely, at the end of the day, if a state is powerful enough, it can ignore the system of international law. Therefore, I think that it is just an international system, and not a system of international law. Cmv
