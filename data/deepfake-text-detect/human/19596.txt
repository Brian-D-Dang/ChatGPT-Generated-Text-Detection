Pretty much says it in the title. Right now, I'm in Australia, an ostensibly 21st century secular country, unable to go out for a drink with my friends because it's Good Friday, and state law says that I'm apparently legally required to observe it to some degree. Such laws are common in otherwise secular countries, perhaps most famously the tanzverbot in Germany. When it comes to special laws on Sunday, I disagree, but I do see the rationale in providing for laws for a common weekly day of rest, and Sunday is as good as any other. However, when it comes to Easter, there is no rationale other than trying to forcibly impose Christian observances on the wider population, and this has no place in a secular country.
