First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from people's discomfort with their own nonconformity and outlying ideas more than from a thirst for truth. Additional info: I am currently writing an essay on the phenomenon of'groupthink' so the theme is ripe in my mind. I showed this sub to a friend of mine who immediately believes the moral statuses quo of Tumblr, including contradicting ideas, and has always seemed to me to have difficulty breaking social norms and thinking for herself. Her immediate reaction was to dismiss all posts she saw as'stupid' (that'd be the first page of'hot' at time of posting). This, no doubt, has influenced my view. I'd like to highlight again that I am excited to have found this sub and I'll be visiting here often. But I'd like to discuss this idea first. P.S. I'm so meta I post requests for people to change my view about rchangemyview on rchangemyview as a critique of rchangemyview. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
