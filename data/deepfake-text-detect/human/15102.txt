Stayed here in Dec. 2005. Average rooms and good environment, although empty casino, although that didn't matter for me because I'm not 21 yet. Again, like the Rio Hotel, the hotel room I had had available AV connections in the TV so you can connect your DVD player for the kids. The buffet wasn't that good. I had better. But if it's cheap, it's a good hotel to sleep in on the LV Strip. RIP Stardust Hotel
