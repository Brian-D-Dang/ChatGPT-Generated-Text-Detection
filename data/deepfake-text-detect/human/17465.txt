Anyone who has ever had a menial job knows that there is always something to do. If you complain (or gloat) to your boss, "I'm finished with everything, this is boring, there's nothing to do!," he will gladly find something for you to do (though it probably won't be fun). Why doesn't that principle scale up? I have very little knowledge of economics, but I understand that there is an argument against raising minimum wage that goes something like this: A significant minimum wage increase would redouble employers' incentive to develop more automation (for example in the fast food industry) in order to offset the costs of having to pay employees more, thus leaving more people unemployed, thus being overall damaging to the original intention of raising the standard of living. This thinking led me to the consider Public Works programs such as the ones FDR implemented in the 30s to combat the Great Depression. Why can't we do something like that again, continuously, increasingly? It seems reasonable to me that there could be an office where you go when you need a job, and a useful job could be provided to you. It might be like that crap job the boss gives you when you complain of boredombut it would be work. What drawbacks or failings to this idea am I overlooking? EDIT: I should mention, I'm an American speaking generally about American stuff here. Pardon my (unintentional) ethnocentrism! Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
