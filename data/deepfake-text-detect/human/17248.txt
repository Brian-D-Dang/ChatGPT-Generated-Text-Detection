What I mean by this is that I disagree with laws that ban assault weapons and large magazines. Most murders are not large scale shootings and it does not take am assault rifle to kill someone. Clearly, this logic has a limit and I do not mean for it to apply to bazookas or anything crazy but I do not understand why it is normal to ban guns (or bullets and magazines) based on what type they are.
