Basically, they pay for the movie. Different companies often "share the load" of production costs and split distribution, merchandising, and home video profits.', "It takes a lot of people to bring a movie to market, and different companies specialize in different things. You have the studio (sometimes multiple studios depending on where it's shot), the production company (usually multiple production companies depending on how expensive the movie is to make), the distributor (usually multiple distributors in different countries), etc. Here's a quick breakdown: Studios do all the high-level management and take care of things like where the movie is filmed. Often studios have sound stages for this purpose. Production companies raise the money from investors to make the movie. Distributors handle contracts of getting the movie out to theaters and licensing it for distribution on Netflix, iTunes, distribution to foreign theaters (sometimes including handling things like subtitles and translation services), and collecting all the fees associated with stuff like that. Sometimes you have a different distributor for each country. Then you have your companies that do things like special effects, which may be a totally different company than anything associated with the studio. Sound editing, scoring, recording, and re-recording can be another company, even one for each of those. Etc, etc, etc.
