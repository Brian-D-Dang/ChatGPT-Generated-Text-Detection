Subscribing to the culture of fear is an attempt to demonstrate to people that you have no problems in your life. You are trying to show people that you are of such high-status and trouble-free, that you are able to worry about ebola, terrorism or gangs of hoodlums breaking into your house to rape your dog and murder you. Obviously, some people are genuinely afraid of these things, so I'm not speaking about those people, who either have mental health problems or are just dumb. The rest of the people who are caught up in climate of fear, can't possibly be dumb enough to think they are in real danger. The reason I think it is an attempted signifier of high-status is according to Biologist Amotz Zahavi's 1975 'handicap principle' suggests that a signal of strength (or high status) is one that is costly to the signaler (as this could not be afforded by an individual who is weak), as well as highly visible. Buying hazmat suits, guns, security cameras, etc, meets Zahavi's criteria as costly and highly visible. EDIT: I don't mean fear in general, but the kind of panicky fear espoused by journalist and politicians, ie: Ebola, terrorism, maniacal criminals. [Here is how wikipedia explains it.] EDIT 2: Status just isn't socioeconomic. EDIT 3: [Here is wikipedia's definition of social status.] EDIT 4: I can't tell if you guys are playing a prank on me or not, but I clearly stated in my first paragraph by fear, I was referring to the culture of fear. It was also reasonably clear that I was speaking of social status not economic. I even explained what I meant in my comments. If you don't know what the culture of fear or social status is, then why wouldn't you look them up before commenting?
