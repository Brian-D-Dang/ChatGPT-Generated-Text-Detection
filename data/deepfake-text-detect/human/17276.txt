I'd like to pre-face this by saying that I truly hope we get to one point as a society where there is no 'slut-shaming'. Where we can all like in a Brave New World-esque society - but that isn't reality at the moment. I can't help but think less of a girl who sleeps aroundcockteases. Not because of the very nature - but because in most scenarios this girl is confirming to societal normals. She isn't some forward-thinking independent woman who understands it isn't a big deal. She knows it's 'wrong' (I use 'wrong' here as the situation that lead to this CMV post involved a friend lying to my girlfriend about it due to guilt - and also saying it wasn't going to happen if we let them come back to crash at our house) Anyway, the person who she slept with spent the full night berating past girls he's slept with, etc - so she obviously knew he had little respect for women. So I just see that as her having little respect for herself. I know there is a MASSIVE double standard when it comes to guysgirls, and there is that facetious analogue 'A shitty lock lets any key open it - but a master-lock opens any door' which perpetuates that standard further. But that's millions of years of biology thousands of years of society engrained into us and it's going to take us a bit longer to transcend past that. TL:DR Summary: Slut-shaming happens, if a girl chooses to sleep with multiple partners she is opening herself to this and is aware of it before-hand. The fact that they still go ahead with it makes me loose a lot of respect for the person as I know they're opening themselves up to this negative reputation.
