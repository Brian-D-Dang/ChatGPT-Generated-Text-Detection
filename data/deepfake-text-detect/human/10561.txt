From metapedia: A 2007 peer-reviewed study appearing in the Tropical Journal of Medical Research has noted that contrary to "the popular belief that the black people generally have longer penile sizes" that in reality "there is no convincing scientific background to support the ascription of bigger penile dimensions to people of the Black race." In fact the study discovered that "the average erect length of the American Caucasians was surprisingly longer" than Negroidssampled, but that the latter were longer flaccid.','No. I think the last time I saw this the Kinsey report was cited. You should be able to google that.','It's a myth. The average penis size is the same regardelss of race. But I do think a vagina can be affected by the size of the penis penetrating but any "stretching" will usually retract. It's passing a baby that can do the real damage to it.
