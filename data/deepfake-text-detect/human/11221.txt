China's National Health Commission has confirmed the first case of human infection with H10N3, a strain of bird flu. The patient survived and there were no other cases. Widespread transmission of the disease is extremely unlikely as it is a low pathogenic strain of the virus. There are many strains of bird flu, but they mainly affect those who work with poultry regularly. The worst instance of bird flu in China killed around 300 people between 2016 and 2017.
