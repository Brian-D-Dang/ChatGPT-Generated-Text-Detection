[To sum up the issue: A senator in MO has proposed a bill that regulates what tax funded welfare funds may be used for, basically making 'luxury' items ineligible.] When I entered the comment section, I was honestly really surprised to find that I hold a minority opinion. I feel like this is a perfectly reasonable proposal. The programs allot specific amounts of money to aid families in getting the essentials. If there is enough of a surplus to purchase "extras," then the budget should be re-evaluated. I don't think this has anything to do with privilege or fairness, but regulations to ensure that the goals of the programs are met at the lowest possible cost. Hello, users of CMV!
