I realize the OP is a bit vague, so let me clarify. Similar to false advertising, I believe that people who release lies (in a publishable, marketable format). This includes magazines, (information based) books, etc. Now, dont get me wrong. I fully agree with freedom of speech. But when the speech is being purposely distributed to the public to spread lies, my agreement tends to disappear. I'll just clarify a little bit more. if a book is saying something, claiming facts that are not true, (for the sake of argument) that the US faked the moonlanding but there is massive evidence against it, this book should not be allowed. same with "documentary" books that base arguments against fake studies etc. Hello, users of CMV!
