Amazon revealed its latest delivery drone design at the re:MARS conference. The drone is about the size of a go-cart, can fly up to 15 miles, and deliver packages up to 5 pounds. Amazon has yet to announce when the first deliveries made by these drones will be, but the company has acknowledged that they are in talks with regulators to gain approval for countrywide consumer delivery. The drone is able to take off and land vertically, like a helicopter, and can switch to an airplane mode once it's in the air. Amazon Prime customers are now able to receive free one-day shipping on over 10 million products. A one minute video is available that shows the new drone in flight.
