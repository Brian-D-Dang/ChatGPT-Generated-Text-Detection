It's pretty straight foreword. If I have seven positions open, and (looking at just the experience in the field and qualifications) the seven most qualified applicants for said positions happen to be white males, I believe that hiring one or more women or minorities just to be diverse is a bad thing. That cheapens the quality of hired and IMO is actually discriminatory (hiring a less qualified woman or minority just because of their sex or race is no different that not hiring a more qualified woman or minority for the same reasons).
