When the branch was formed, Alexander Hamilton said that it lacked the checks that the other branches have (Congress can impeach a president for abuse of power and defund parts of the executive branch, and pass constitutional amendments to override the Supreme Court, and the president has the power to veto and nominates the Justices). When a Supreme Court ruling is declared, they have no power to enforce that it is implemented, an example is after Brown v Board of Education Eisenhower didn't enforce any implementation until violence broke out in Little Rock, Arkansas and yet there still were segregated schools for at least 20 years after this ruling. The checks in 'checks and balances' is the ability to overrule a branch that is becoming too powerful. Therefore, in order for the Supreme Courts to have that power, they must be able to impeach and remove from office anyone who refuses to act on these decisions. If you have other ways that you think will give the courts the proper 'checks' that the other branches do, don't be afraid to mention them!
