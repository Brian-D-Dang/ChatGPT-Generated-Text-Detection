My favorite place in Vegas in terms of getting away from tourist and uber-marketing. This place is a classic, and the food is excellent. If they have the King Salmon - get it. Cream corn was very good too. Only reason they don't get 5 stars: their Gulf Shrimp appetizer was just average. Sauces all ran together and only 12 the shell removed which was odd. Definitely stop by when you are in Vegas.
