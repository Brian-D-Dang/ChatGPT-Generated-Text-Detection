Gender dysphoria is real. I get it. Trans people attempt to fix this through surgical genital mutilation and hormone therapy. That is the choice of an individual, and I can respect anyone's decision to do whatever they choose to do to their body. I don't think the trans struggle is on the same level as that of homosexuals and racial minorities. If you get extensive body modifications then struggle to afford the hormones you need to feel like whatever gender you swapped to, I have little sympathy. I feel like my lack of sympathy stems from the "I feel like I should have been malefemale" argument. Is there a universal standard for what it feels like to be a male or female? Can any male ever truly know what its like to be a female, and express any desire for that state of mind? How can anyone "feel" like they should be something other than what they are? Can people "feel" like they should be gay but aren't, "feel" like they should be an elephant but aren't, "feel" like they should be a PhD but aren't? I struggle to understand the notion. Change my view please! EDIT lots of great discussion, thanks to everyone for contributing! EDIT2 everyone please read this reply: I think this is the best reply in the discussion and has changed my view because I realize I was misinformed about the basic definition of gender, and about the amount of discrimination levied against trans people.
