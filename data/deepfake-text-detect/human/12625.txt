Christopher, a confused 6 year old boy, stared inside the container of the blue box that he just found now, from his backyard. He sat there, crouching like a normal kid he was, when they just discovered something new, especially from under the ground. He poked the blue box with his plastic shovel, still confused about the container in it. Truthfully, he was hoping to see a dinasour bone or a secret treasure that was hided by the pirate themselves. Instead, he was greeted by a weird looking, greep plastic, with a wire on it, and a red-black military clothing that seems to fit for a 20 year old man. Christopher, was upset with the discovery when he finnaly processed the item inside the box. He threw the clothes back, and smashed the box with the opener. He slammed it back to the hole, and return to his home, crying out of frustration. Sadly, his action won't stopped the prophecy. Whatever he do, either to be nice or neutral. He still going to be the bad guy.
