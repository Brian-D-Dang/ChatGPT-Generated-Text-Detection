NOTE: I have no intention of any sort of self harm. We are going to die at some point, and at that point (or some point relatively soon after) all of our memories, loves, hopes, accomplishments, failures and mundane scratchings will cease to be. If I surpass any previous accomplishment by any other human, or spend all my days watching Spanish soap operas and eating chips (I don't speak Spanish), the end result is the same: oblivion. All I want is peace, and an end to stress and worry. To live is to suffer, and death brings nothing but relief. Change my view. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
