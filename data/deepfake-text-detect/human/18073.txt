Given perfect knowledge of the workings and the current state of a human brain, I believe it's possible to predict what a person will do in the future. [Studies (citations 3, 4) ] show brain scans can predict motions before the person is aware of deciding to move. Modern physics at best enables decisions to have multiple outcomes with predictable probabilities (stochastic rather than deterministic). There may be a random physical mechanism in the universe deciding whether you scratch your nose with your right hand or your left, but that's still far from free will. In order to truly have free will, I believe you necessarily must invoke something non-physical (ie a spirit) that decides to reach in and nudge that random variable in favor of the right hand or left hand. This is an untestable theory, therefore unscientific and meaningless. Without a non-physical element, any outcome is predictable by its constituent physical processes (given sufficient knowledge). I'm happy to discuss implications as well as argue the point. Morality of the justice system often comes up, but I don't think it's problematic to my viewpoint. EDIT: Several people have pointed out that various definitions of free will exist. I'm interested in facilitating the broadest discussion possible, so please feel free to give your preferred definition and argue from that standpoint.
