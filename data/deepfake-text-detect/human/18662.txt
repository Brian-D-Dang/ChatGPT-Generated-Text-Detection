Jon Stewart has become nothing more than a pundit just like Bill O'Reilly, Keith Olbermann, Glen Beck, etc. He claims his show is purely comedic, and a satirizes the ineffectiveness of the major news outlets, while only contributing to the problem. For him to claim that he is anything more than a Sean Hannity except for the left is just pure self denial. Noticeably, he continues to demonize Fox News, but is comparatively tame towards MSNBC, a network equally as guilty for bias, but their bias is in line with his, therefore they get a pass. Stewart has also been extremely tame in the way he's treated this administration. I believe that the majority of Daily Show viewers are uninformed people that actually get their news from Stewart. All of their opinions and assumptions about current events come form Stewart. Most of them have not actually watched Fox News, but Jon Stewart says they suck, so they must suck. Sounds simplistic, but I believe it. I think the Daily Show has an agenda, and Stewart is a hypocrite to bash the bias of the news because all he does is present his biased feelings of the news. Change my view. edit: Originally I said that he "never" criticizes MSNBC, that is obviously untrue, but he definitely lets them off the hook easier than he should. edit: This post got a LOT of attention. I'm responding when I can. Sorry for not responding to everything so quickly. I'd like to think about my responses before I post them.
