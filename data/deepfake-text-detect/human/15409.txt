I swear I NEVER like to leave a bad review based on just the service. I've been to teainfusion several times, not because their whack fake boba is that good, but to see if every employee was rude or maybe I caught them on a bad day. I understand hemorrhoids, headaches, tummy bubbles, and domestic issues. I know everyone has a bad day. Well this place has a freakin' black cloud just chillin over it! Everytime I step in this joint, it's clear that the person behind the counter feels inconvenienced by having to actually make my order. Seriously, I'm ordering a chai tea with boba, not baked alaska. The worst part is I'm in a pissy mood when I leave the place. So I gave it a try and the only thing that comes to mind....... treat me like ass once, shame on you. Treat me like ass twice, shame on me. Treat me like ass three times, and I'm calling you out. Get a grip tea fusion you are not the only spot in Tempe Market Place, your tea is mediocre at best and your boba is not even legit. I sincerely hope the managers take this review into consideration. And, on one last personal note, If I get another pair of eyes rolled at me when I walk by the store I'll personly sit outside and hand out samples from paradise bakery, coffe bean and juice it up smoothies! All of which offer tea.
