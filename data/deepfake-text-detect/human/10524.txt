We stitch the nerve ends together and let the body heal itself, so basically both your ideas are right. A nerve is made up of several bundles of what we call axons and dendrites surrounding by special supportive tissue - projections from the main nerve cell that convey information from one place to the other. Axons from the cell outwards, dendrites inwards. Now, when you cut a nerve, the nerve cell remains living, but its branches were cut. By reattaching the supportive tissue into place, the cell knows in which direction it should send its signals and will try to grow back. Some do, some don't, as we can't attach it perfectly, even though we try. From the cutoff point, the cell part that was there dies, but a new one will grow in its place, at about 1mm each day. This means that for some time after the injury, the body part will be unable to feel or move, but eventually it will happen again. There are several techniques that can be used which differ based upon how many bundles we stitch together at a time, but the results are fairly similar. The problem is when you also kill the cell, say in a spinal injury. In that case it is much mire difficult, because there are far fewer cells remaining that can regrow the nerves. Results are showing, but they are far less exciting than cutting a nerve in a finger, viewed from this perspective.
