I gather from Jaime who works here that they are hurting and they brought him in to stop giving things away. Now they charge 2 for a squirt of air freshener. Wow.... won't be back again. This place is now double the cost of the car wash just north on 83rd in front of Walmart. The quality and customer care has gone there instead of here.
