Having one Bernie Sanders as President is one thing but I don't think it'll result in anything even close to what his supporters would hope. Let's cut the cynicism for a moment and let's say that Bernie Sanders is one hundred percent dedicated and accomplishing each and every one of his goals laid out in his agenda. Given that the right hates this guy and the amount of corporate influence amongst the Senate (and it's not just limited to the right, I realize), I don't think it's worth being invested in who becomes President so long as the GOP remains as influential as they are in Congress. We don't need one Bernie. We need 100 Bernies. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
