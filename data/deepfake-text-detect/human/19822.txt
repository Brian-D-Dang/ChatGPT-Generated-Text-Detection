I (obviously an American) find soccer to be incredibly boring and cannot understand how most of the world likes it so much. I imagine playing it is pretty fun because of the intensity, but I would rather watch paint dry than watch a soccer game. There are barely any goals in a game, it's considered an exciting game if the score is 2-1 or something. Plus the game can end in a tie, what the fuck is that shit? I just got bored to death for two hours to have nothing happen at all? Plus the flopping or diving or whatever you call it is the worst part. Out of the games I've watched every fucking 5 minutes some dude is pretending to have broken his leg or something. It's fucking stupid, annoying, and quite frankly, some pussy shit. I realize that a lot of people (Americans included) find baseball to be boring and slow paced, and it is more slow paced than soccer but I do not find the game boring at all because as a former player I understand the intricacies of the game and whatnot. It might be the same for soccer, idk.
