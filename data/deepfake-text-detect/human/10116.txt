Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but some opinions are better than others [edit: I am referring to them being morallyethically "better. If you submitted a topic to this sub with the title "I find gay people sickening. CMV" there would be tons of replies and circle jerking about all the ways the OP was wrong. That's because, I'm assuming, enough people have decided it's morally wrong to discriminate against gay people that there will be actual dissention. If you posted a thread with the title "Gay people deserve the same rights as straight people," you would get into a war of semantics and what it meant to have the "same rights" as another person, because not many people would be willing to argue against the base viewpoint of the post. These are just examples to illustrate what I'm getting at, so please don't get distracted by them in your replies. They are just illustrations and may not be the best examples I could have chosen. To reiterate, some opinions are better than others ethically and morally speaking, especially when you voice them to a fairly homogenous group that is likely to share similar values (reddit). To argue against them, we have to resort to semantics and, in my opinion, that never feels like a proper argument against the original thesis of the question. CMV. Hello, users of CMV!
