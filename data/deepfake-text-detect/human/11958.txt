Kent Police detained the two suspects, aged 22 and 20, at Dover Eastern Docks in the early hours of Sunday. They are being held under Section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006, on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts. A spokesman for the South East Counter Terrorism Unit said the arrests were not linked to Friday's attacks in Paris, which left 129 people dead.
