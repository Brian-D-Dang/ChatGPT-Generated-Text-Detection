This is tricky for me, because obviously any supporting arguments for me would be classified information, but this is my general reasoning. 1) There are a lot of people who have unfriendly attitudes towards the US. Given how frequently bombings occur in foreign countries, it is utterly surprising how rare it is here. (yes I am aware of boston, the shoe bomber, etc, I still think its odd how rare it is here.) So here I guess I'm making an assumption that there are a lot more thwarted plans that the public does't hear about. 2) Is it easy for somebody to acquire bomb making materials? If not I would say it is because of the efforts of the government. If the answer is "yes" then why arent we seeing more bombings? 3) Being human. I think when it really comes down to it the people who work in government intelligence have a desire to see to it that this country is in safe standing. If this requires unscrupulous behavior so be it. Does the loss of privacy concern me? Of course, but for whatever reason I believe the people in charge have a vested interest in actually preventing harm and not just spying on us as a way to remain in power. edit- MY VIEW HAS CHANGED
