To quote my high school philosophy teacher, "What do they call a doctor who graduates bottom of his class? They still call him doctor." I'm lazy, I procrastinate, and I'm trying to fix that, but it's difficult to find the motivation when I can graduate with a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering by skating along with barely enough work to pass. Then I'll find a job and I'll be happy to work as hard as I can given that I'm being paid to do stuff, but until then, why bother? Convince me otherwise. Hello, users of CMV!
