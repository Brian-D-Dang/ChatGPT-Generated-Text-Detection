[In this other thread] and the original one it's based on, I got downvoted quite a bit by suggesting that if you need - for example - 200 yards of stopping distance, then you should have 200 yards of visibility in front of you at all times. I thought this was basic driving knowledge, and was taught this by all my driving teachers when I was younger. Apparently I'm wrong according to reddit, and I'm not 100 clear why that is. If you need 200 yards to stop, but you are going around a corner where you can only see 50 yards ahead, then I'd consider that reckless and dangerous driving. If a family had a broken-down car just around the corner, you would certainly rear-end it and potentially kill people as a result. Similarly, when it starts to snow or there's a thick fog, people should slow down such that their braking distance is equal to or less than current visibility. [I recall this accident from quite a while ago] that resulted from people going super-fast through dense fog. 8 people died. Is there any rational and logical and reasonable reason why people should go so fast that their visibility is significantly less than their braking distance? If so, I might be able to have my view changed. ETA: Sorry, I guess I wasn't 100 clear. I'm talking about situations where you do not see any other traffic on the road. This rule wouldn't apply to traffic scenarios (in which case I'd apply the "2-second rule" instead). ETA: You can't really leave exactly X yards of visibility in front of you - since on a straight road that may require you to go 300mph. I didn't state this previously, but I'd reword my title to: If it takes X yards to stop your car, then you should have at least X yards of visibility in front of you at all times. Sorry for the confusion.
