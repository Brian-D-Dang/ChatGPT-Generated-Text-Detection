For those of you unaware, a Nightcore mix of a song is basically the same song, but with the vocals tone-shiftedsped-up to sound "weird..." Kind-of-like-a-girl-but-not-really. I try to be open-minded about various kinds of music, but I honestly do not see anything at all in Nightcore mixes. As an example, I'll use ATC's [Around The World] . Now, maybe you think the song's bland, simplistic, uncreative, or whatever, but it's still an original work. It required some creative thought put into it, and some level of skill. [Here's] and "Extended Club Mix" of the song. Despite keeping the same basic repeating melody, it still sounds very different. The intro is different, the bass is pumped up, the song is longer, certain sections are extended, others are shortened. It required some amount of input before it became what it was. It might be very similar, but it's not so similar that you can say there was no skill or creative effort involved. And [here's] a Nightcore mix. It's the exact same fucking thing! Just sped up! Like, how is this of any value whatsoever? There's probably a script out there somewhere that can turn your entire library into Nightcore. This is about as creative as color-inverting the Mona Lisa. Please, CMV. I like to appreciate all kinds of art, and this is one form I honest to God don't "get." Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
