It never really hit me. It still hasn't. I keep hoping it will, some sort of sullen, cold loneliness that comes from knowing you're the last. We were already alone, each one separate and individual, struggling to find someone who knew just the slightest bit of what we did. Already existentially alone, sad, and broken, but the unity we had was each other. We were all alone, together. We all lived, loved, and died alone, all the same, not one would go on. This is different. I have no comfort in knowing I'm not the only one suffering, not the only one who has gone through this before. I had friends, a love, a life, just like everyone else. I was Just one in a billion. Now, I'm just one.
