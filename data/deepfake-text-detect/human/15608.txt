Lemme be clear. I don't own a gun. I'm not into shooting guns, or particularly even holding one. (My hands shake and I start feeling nauseous.) But I gotta say, after being in a few different gun shops for work...this place really takes the cake. I agree with Dave S. that Hyatt is a very highly respected shop. It's in fact one of the top 10 largest in volume gun dealers in the entire country. (One of the store employees even printed out the article to show me.) You'll see the vast selection of firearms on the walls, in the cases...and all the employees I talked to know their stuff inside and out. I was told the story behind machine guns, and the history behind certain handguns. The place is almost ALWAYS packed (even on Black Friday...when they don't offer any discountssales) and what I admire is how the salespeople take their time with each customer no matter how busy it is. The fact the customers all wait patiently and don't get mad...now that's loyalty.
