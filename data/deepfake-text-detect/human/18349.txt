Tax is incredibly debilitating to the growth of your business and hiring of employees. Especially to your small business, and any legal loophole that allows you to escape it should be used. Rich corporations? Good, you deserve the extra income, because you had the skills and LUCK to get to the spot you're in now. Society needs rich people to look up to. For example, in my own personal case, my business makes just enough money for me to survive. It pays my car, insurance, rent, and food. Thats just about it. It's critical for me to keep this business, and a tax bill of ANY amount would put me under. Yet, at the end of the year, im supposed to come up with 20-30 of that money that was already spent on rent and food long since digested. I will happily learn about and utilize any tricks that let me avoid taxes. I fully support moving your money to tax havens as well. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
