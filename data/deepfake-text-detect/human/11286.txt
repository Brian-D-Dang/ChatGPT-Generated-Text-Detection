Chipotle Mexican Grill will open its first digital-only restaurant on Saturday. The location will only service online orders and will not include a dining room or an area for ordering. All orders will have to be made on Chipotle's app, website, or on third-party delivery platforms. The restaurant will be able to accommodate large catering orders. Chipotle reported that its digital sales more than tripled in the third quarter and they predict that this year's digital orders could more than double last year's total.
