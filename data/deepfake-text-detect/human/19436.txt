I am specifically talking about people who are either scared of nuclear power. There are videos about Fukushima making the rounds with lots of people commenting how it's really scary and terrible. Yet there have been over 2000 nuclear tests in the history of humanity. Even though there have been ill effects from those tests, they are miniscule. The reactors undergoing meltdown is a speck in terms of the global picture of nuclear testing nuclear accidents. (I'm only grouping those two categories because I believe that nuclear testing is way worse than what happened at Fukushima). In my opinion, people who are scared of nuclear power are a lot like people scared of air travel. Their fear is irrational and based on unrealistic what-if scenarios. It seems to me that almost any way you look at nuclear power, it's some of the best stuff that humanity has ever created and the fear is holding us back as a species.
