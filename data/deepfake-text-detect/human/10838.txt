Those formative years are when the brain writes its own software for how to remember things. Only after that software is written can you start to retain long-term memories.', "This is not an entirely understood part of memory psychology. There are a handful of theories that attempt to explain this, two of which focus on issues of retrieval and two others that say that infertile amnesia is due to encoding failure. One of the first two, a theory developed by Freud says that the early years of our lives are very stressful and so we choose not remember anything of them to reduce emotional discomfort (this likely not true since this theory would predict that any memories of childhood would be neutral, however in practiceexperiment they aren't neutral). Another theory focused on retrieval issues is a theory that states that before verbal language is acquired, memories are stored in a non verbal format, and once we make the switch to verbal storage of memories we lose the ability to recall non verbal memories. This too has its faults since experimenters were able to teach language to a child who was disconnected from the world for the first part of her life (she's known as the feral child if you wanna read more about it) and after she acquired knowledge she was able to recall what had happened to her and communicate it in a verbal manner. The other too theories focus on encoding problems. The first says that children do not have a sense of self-awareness till 18-24 months of age. Until this is developed they cannot recall what they did (follows the idea of how can I remember when'I' wasn't there). The last theory is on neurological immaturity, in that the frontal lobe and hippocampus are not yet set up to encode memories. In the first few years, the child's brain is undergoing very intense synaptic formation etc. In, all the answer is to likely to be just one of these theories, rather it would probably be a combination of them.
