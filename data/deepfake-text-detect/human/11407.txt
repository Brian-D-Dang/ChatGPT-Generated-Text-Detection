A college student who stole 5 million in cryptocurrencies using SIM swap attacks (hacking the user's phone and using that to gain access to their email and cryptocurrency wallets) has accepted a plea deal of 10 years in prison. Joel Ortiz stole funds from around 40 victims. Authorities have been slowly arresting and sentencing cryptocurrency thieves, aiming to send a message that people who commit these crimes do get caught and that the consequences of these crimes are severe.
