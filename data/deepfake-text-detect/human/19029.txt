edit: I meant to type "criminals" instead of "prisoners" in my title. I think this because I feel an enormous amount of empathy for people who are in prison for long periods. Especially those that are there to simply rot. By punishment I mean locking someone up in a jail cell to do nothing but sit there. Restricting a person's rights, freedoms, privacy, essentially the traditional image that the term "jail cell" evokes. I believe that every action a person commits has explainable reasons, not to be confused with a justification. Whether it be a train of thought, a mental illness, a drug problem, growing up in a life of crime, etc. There is either a story or condition behind every crime, a person can either be educated, treated, otherwise rehabilitated. I think people should still be removed from society if they are a danger, but not for the purposes of punishment. A prison should not be a punishing environment. Hypothetically a person could be in prison for life if they can never be rehabilitated, e.g. a murdering sociopath with no emotion. However I don't like the concept of sentencesputting someone away for a semi-arbitrary period of time. Someone should be in prison on a however long it takes basis. I am not advocating for a torturebrainwash facility, and doing it with good intentions but half-assed would probably do more harm than good. Parking violations and speeding probably doesn't need to be dealt with via some type of rehabilitation. But who knows, maybe there is something that can be addressed?
