I'm a member of the marching band at my high school, and every time a football player gets injured on the field, everything stops. People get dead silent, we stop playing, and all the players on the field get on one knee. I can't bring myself to feel sorry for someone who plays a sport that has a very high risk of injury. Another reason why I probably hold this view though is because of the fact I'm in marching band. During our halftime show people will be talking, yelling, and carrying on like we aren't really there, but do the exact opposite when a football player gets injured playing this dangerous sport. CMV.
