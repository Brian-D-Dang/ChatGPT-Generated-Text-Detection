In a perfect world, puzzles would come in boxes with no pictures on them, maybe a word description of what you'd be putting together. But alas, it doesn't work that way, for the pretty good trade off reason of people want to know that they're getting a quality puzzle, which makes sense to me. But I can't stand when you're making a puzzle with people and they want to check the box. The point is to enjoy the slight but time-passing pleasure of discovery a picture by putting it together. When you're looking at the box every minute or so, you remove all the joy of creating the picture as well as most of the challenge of pairing the colors and shapes. How can someone justify using the box in a puzzle unless they are truly stumped beyond a doubt and have no other option, after guess-and-checking every remaining piece? CMV, ladies and gents.
