I've heard stories of a neighbor's child being fed nothing but McDonald's Happy Meals for most of her childhood. She ended up with severe health problems that were hidden from her school under the guise of a medical condition that she didn't actually have. This child is about 9 years old now. As far as I know, nothing has changed with her home life. This is, of course, all hearsay. Another story of social services failing, I guess? No one can really assess a child's health but a parent, and you can be pretty certain that an average parent doesn't have a clue what proper nutrition even looks like. The average child's meal has a cute toy with it, but oh well if it causes malnutrition, obesity, and diabetes. There is no one for the parent to blame, since it was the parents choice. So everything continues along as usual. (For someone who thinks this really isn't a problem: When is it expected that a parent to learn about complicated nutritional information? Very few people understand nutrition through the lies of advertisement and, for lack of a better phrase, "fat logic." Even among those who do get it, affordable alternative options are nearly non existent.)
