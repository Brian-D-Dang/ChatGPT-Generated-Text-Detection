Many cities have sales taxes that are added on. - Delivery may be more expensive in the city (can't use as big of tankers to navigate city streets, etc.) - Supply and demand. There's way more demand in the city, and cities don't like to zone for gas stations downtown (they're environmental hazards, for one thing). Interestingly, I've lived in very rural places, and gas tends to be more expensive there. (Because there's less competition, and because the gas stations actually have to make a profit on their gas because they sell less of it, and they sell less stuff from the convenience store attached to it.),In addition to what other people have mentioned, the cost of the property in the city is also higher and they have to make up for that.','My personal experience is the opposite (I live in the rural areas outside of Austin TX). Lack of competition means that gas stations can charge whatever they want and people can either not drive or buy it. If the city you live in happen to have more expensive gas it will be due to city taxes.','Gas for 1.99 a gallon? Do you own a time machine?? I just paid 4.39 a gallon at my local shell station a few hours ago...
