In hopes that TGI's would bring a little more to the table then what Sam's Town puts out...wishful thinking. I would much rather head out to the food-court, order a Big Mac and watch that howling wolf, then to spend 30 at this place again. I have generously given them an extra star due to the major crisis our server claimed they were experiencing during our visit. Needless to say, it took a good while to get menus, and twice as long to get drink orders in. We ordered Buffalo Wings from their Happy Hour. Wings were cold and had an odd flavor. The fries came later when we were almost finished eating our Wings. They were SO salty, we ended leaving the entire basket. Our Mozzarella sticks were delicious, and earned a whole whoopin star for great taste and freshness!! Cheese was fresh and stringy, just like a cheese stick should look. Other than our cheese sticks, everything about this location was below average.
