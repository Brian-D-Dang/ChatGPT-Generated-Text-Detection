If you play MTG, you'll know that land destruction and mana denial is getting pretty much phased out of the game. This is because it stops the other player from casting spells, essentially locking them out of the game. That's not much fun - the reason you play the game is to cast spells, right? We can also look at TF2 as another example of this. There exist exactly two ranges ways of slowing down your opponents (natascha slows, and the sandman stuns). These two weapons get nerfed time and again because it doesn't let you do anything. Even the most skilled players can't outplay an opponent who's got them locked in place with natascha. Again, having fun is why you play the game - and not playing is not fun. So this brings me to league: why does CC, an inherently unfun mechanic, exist? Or rather, why is it "allowed" to be good? I mean WOTC still prints land destruction but it's always overcosted or underpowered. Valve made the mittens (forces opponent to laugh but is a melee weapon and you have to hit them in the back), which are also pretty bad. (Note: by CC I mean slows, stuns and snares)
