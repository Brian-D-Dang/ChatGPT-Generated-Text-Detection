Smashing one's head into various objects tends to cause concussions. Concussions in themselves are quite harmful for brain development. However, you may have heard the semi-recent news that repeated concussions tend to cause long-term brain damage and [chronic traumatic encephalopathy.] [Another source] These problems will be made even worse in school-age children because the brain hasn't finished developing yet. Also: The system as it is now encourages obsession with a career that, with a rounding error, is guaranteed to end within four years. (Maybe 8, for middle schoolers). I grant that this is a problem that exists in most school sports, but that says more about sports in general than it does about the safety of football. Adults are generally trusted to be aware of these dangers. While this is not always the case in reality, the fact of the matter is that by 21 years, people are trusted to buy guns and smoke tobacco and vote in elections. Kids aren't, though, and playing football is far more dangerous than drinking alcohol. Sorry for waiting so long to fill in an argument. I had to get some sleep.
