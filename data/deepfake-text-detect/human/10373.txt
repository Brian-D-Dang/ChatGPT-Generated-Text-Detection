There must have been thousands of times when I was talking about a hypothetical person when it came to picking pronouns and I chose the pronoun she or he, maybe I wrote heshe, and it just feels like using something like "xe" would be much more accurate andor easier than using heshe. Tell me why using xe or something like it in our every day language wouldn't be good. I can see some people holding the view that this word has been dirtied by some people cough tumblr cough but I still believe that it wouldn't matter if a lot of people used it. Hello, users of CMV!
