First thing, let's assume the biblical Jesus is completely true. Now, I have a fair knowledge of the biblical tale, but if I say something wrong, feel welcome to correct me. I'll use the most "accepted" version of the story: Jesus was one with God, part of the Holy Trinity and one day he decided humanity should be saved with the ultimate sacrifice: his own life. In order to do that he came to Earth and lived like a normal human, teaching his ways to others. 30 and something years after his human birth he met his fate. Tortured and humiliated he sacrificed his life to give humanity a chance of redemption, he was the Lamb of God. After that he was resurrected and went back to heaven to live like god for the rest of eternity Alright, this is a big deal because a divine creature came to Earth to sacrifice himself for humans, an unthinkable act. Problem is, Jesus choices were: 1. Save humanity and suffer a lot of pain for a couple months (if you consider the very act of becoming human a bad thing, then let's say 30ish years) and go back to Heaven 2. Not save humanity and stay as god forever Provided you're not completely cold and oblivious being, 1) is clearly the only logical choice here, you are trading an infinitely small piece of your life for saving an entire race that you created, why not? Compared to eternity the suffering is meaningless. It's like if for giving 1 cent to a person Bill Gates could save that persons life. Of course he would. Anyone would. You don't need to be pure goodness to do that, not even close. So, what is the merit of Jesus sacrifice?
