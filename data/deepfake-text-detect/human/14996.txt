Kokopelli Winery is in a great location but the food and wine are wanting. The white wines were very strange and the reds didn't make me want to buy a case. I did purchase three wines- one white and two reds, hoping that at a later time I might grow to love them. The whites are too sweet for me and the flavors are weird. Yes weird. The food wasn't bad, but we did really enjoy the music. It is fun just to check out. I will go back and try different vintages from Kokopelli in the future. It may end up developing some unique vintages and is different enough to make it worth my time.
