Speed cameras are a way for the government to tell when people are breaking the law. That's why they exist. It completely defeats the point if they have to be clearly signed and visible. Because of this, people just brake right before the camera, and speed up again on the other side of it. Sure speed traps still catch people who aren't paying attention, but that's a small percentage of the dangerous drivers that speed cameras were invented to help prevent. I've heard that they have to be signed to prevent the government from using them as revenue machines, placing them all over the place just as a way of making money. But why is that a bad thing. The only way for drivers to avoid paying a fine if there were speed traps hidden everywhere would be to obey the law. Really there should be speed cameras lining the sides of every street everywhere, because then they would have the effect that they're supposed to have, which is to force people to drive safely. Even if that is an outrageously expensive set-up, we can atleast emulate it by allowing the government to hide cameras anywhere they like. Then we'll never know if we're about to drive past one, so we'll have to obey the speed limits at all times or risk a fine.
