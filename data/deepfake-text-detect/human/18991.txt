Now obviously I don't agree with the super high price inflation that most US citizens are subjected to but I do believe that the idea of paying for healthcare is completely normal. If I want top notch medical service I would feel much more comfortable paying someone for good work than risking getting poor treatment from a government institution. Also, I want to pay for my healthcare and my healthcare only. I would rather bite the bullet paying for care when I need it than having huge increases in taxes to pay for everyone else's. However, I have heard good things from the other side, that a universal healthcare system does work but I have trouble believing that it is any better than paying for my own. CMV
