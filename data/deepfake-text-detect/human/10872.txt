Because other atoms don't form covalent bonds with themselves. Carbon (and the elements beneath it on the periodic table) have a nucleus that pulls just hard enough on its electrons to allow it to "share" electrons with other atoms of the same variety. Edit: The intrinsic complexity involved with life needs big molecules, and big molecules are formed easiest with molecules that are self bonding.', "Because that's not life. That's a nuclear reaction. Life is where something is living, a fire is not living, a nuclear explosion is not alive. The reason nothing larger than carbon or silicon are considered is because the arrangements for the elements larger than that, that keep the -4 charge are too unstable and have arrangements of valences that don't allow for easy bonding.,I don't think silicon is considered one of the "building blocks of life" outside of science fiction. Hypothetically it's similar enough to carbon in its binding properties, but we've never encountered a silicon-based life form. "Life" has a pretty specific definition in the scientific context. The organism has to do certain things like reproduce, grow, actively adapt to its environment, and evolve over time. So the way you define life, I guess things like fusion can be considered life, but the scientific community has a much more specific definition, and organisms that fall within that definition seem to universally use specific elements.
