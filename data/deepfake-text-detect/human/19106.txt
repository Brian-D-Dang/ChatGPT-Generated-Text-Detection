My view is that frequently exposing yourself to germs helps build your immunity. I'm not a gross slob. People who know me don't even know I do these things. I only wash my hands in the obvious cases like after pooping. I never wash them before I eat, which means I maybe wash my hands once or twice each day. I'll eat food I dropped on the floor. The idea of using those free hand sanitizer wipes on a shopping cart seems ridiculous to me. Usually I just rinse my dishes unless I need soap to get off things that are stuck. I know it's a sample size of two, but I've been sick a handful of times in the past 15 years while a near-germaphobe friend of mine is always catching something. CMV
