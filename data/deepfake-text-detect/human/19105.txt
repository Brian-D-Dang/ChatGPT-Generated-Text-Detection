Young people (age 15-24) make up 14 of the population, yet account for 30 of the cost of motor vehicle collisions. Since the age 0-14 age can't drive that means young drivers more that double te cause of traffic collisions from older people. This is due to a few key factors that could be minimized if the driving age changed: teens are inexperienced with alcohol they underestimate consequences only 54 wear there seatbelt [according to 2011 survey] teens often drive with passengers multiplying distracted driving and injury. Overall I think society would be safer I we waited for these children to become adults before we let them operate some of the most dangerous machines in society. [other sources for stats] Now older drivers have a very low rate of traffic violations and the highest seatbelt use of any age group. However starting at age 75 the traffic collision and fatality rate rises to almost that of the youngest age group. Even though the elderly tend to drive only when conditions are safest they still: manage to get int accidents due to poor health problems lack of motor skills bad eyesight neck mobility to check blind spots I believe if we eliminated the 2 most dangerous groups of drivers out roads woul be much safer.
