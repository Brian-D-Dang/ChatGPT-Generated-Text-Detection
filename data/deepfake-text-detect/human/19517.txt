Hey everyone! thank you so much for participation on this thread, my view has been changed! There are lots of interesting discussions going on in the posts, and I want to thank everyone for the insight:) Very commonly I find that Christians who want to follow God and do God's work, do not actually follow the Bible. There are many passages in the Bible that are not pretty, not so heavenly, and not morally (by today's standards) correct. Usually the ten commandments are a given. But people often ignore unfavorable "rules" or passages in the Bible. I know there was a passage about women not being allowed to speak in service, and there are plenty of violent passages too. I guess what I don't understand is how can someone claim to live by the Bible, by literally NOT living by the bible. You can't just say that you will do something, fully believe you are doing it, but not actually do it. I can understand that you may live your life based on the Bible, or in the "spirit" of the Bible by following only the good parts, but I don't understand how you can be a "true Christian" by doing that. Maybe I'm just ignorant here, can someone enlighten me if that is the case?
