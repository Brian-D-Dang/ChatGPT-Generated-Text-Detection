I'm willing to haggle over the time limit, but a gun is a tool used for deadly force. It requires that you maintain constant supervision over it. If you lose control of it, much as you would with any other dangerous item that is controlled by law (chemicals, etc) be required to report it - and if not, you should be held responsible for all crimes committed with the gun. All law-abiding gun owners should support this, as they know and understand how to handle guns safely, and keep track of their guns at all times. People who unknowingly lose control of their guns are negligent. People who knowingly lose control of their guns are accomplices. I don't see why we should allow them to escape under a loophole where someone who releases a toxic cloud of chemicals would go to jail if they didn't report it. It's not that you are automatically guilty if your gun is used - it;s that if your gun is lost and you don't report it that way within a reasonable time - you are guilty. For the record, I support the second amendment (so please don't waste time trying to convince me guns should be legal - I already think they should be). I also support personal responsibility, and that includes responsibility for one's property.
