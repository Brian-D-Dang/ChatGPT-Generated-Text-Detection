Natural M-W says natural has over a dozen definitions look it up] . Natural bread contains high fructose corn syrup, a natural ingredient. This is true for some other food ingredients and processed, highly unnatural foods and food products. Homosexuality is or is not natural, depending on who you talk to. There are other morally objectionable or not objectionable behaviors etc that are natural or unnatural, depending on who you talk to. Evolution and adaptation cause the word itself to change meaning over time. The word basically means "derived from nature," but people have a variety of ideas about what is and what is not natural. I'm not saying the word's definition is completely subjective, I'm saying it conveys no meaning. The best example is probably food labeling; natural products have become unnatural despite their packaging claims. Change my view! Edit: This is a fun, fascinating subreddit.
