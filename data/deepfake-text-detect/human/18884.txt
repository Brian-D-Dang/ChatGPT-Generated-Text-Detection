This is Mod post 38. You can read the previous Mod Post by clicking [here] , or by visiting the [Mod Post Archive] in our wiki. I know this has been brought up in mod posts quite a few times now, but we really feel the need to mention it again due to a lack of activity in our [github repo] . [The first mod post] we posted was in search of a single programmer to take on the job, or at least a small team. It gained a lot of interest and we put together a team of about 10. Only 3 or 4 of these made contributions, and it eventually died down completely. In the comments of that first post, it was suggested that we go open source. It became clear this was the right thing to do, and so [we did it] . Unfortunately, this didn't really do much other than gain some "watchers." For the last few weeks, the only real contributions have come from uAmablue and uPixelOrange (both CMV mods with programming knowledge). So here I am, hopefully for the last time, expressing our need for DeltaBot programmers. We have a list of features that we'd like to implement in the issues list of the repo. Please, even if your knowledge of Python isn't great, try to help out in any way you can. Thank you:) Regards, Snorrrlax and the CMV mod team.
