The government issues union certificates and judges can perform the ceremonies but they must be have God removed from the words. All spouses would be afforded all legal rights. Marriage would be an institution of religious organizations only. When couples get married they would still have to get a government union certificate before the religious ceremony could take place. If ones religion allowed gay marriage fine if not that's fine too. Its their right to allow or not allow gay marriage. Legally gay, straight etc it doesn't matter because in the eyes of the law they would be a union.
