This restaurant is poorly managed and the food is a little below average. However I proceeded to try them again since they offered delivery. I called in a order for Habachi steak, they said I needed to order more than 15 so I added rice noodles with shrimp. They said that wasn't enough so I ordered generals chicken as well. The order was placed at 7:20 arrived at 8:30 with no Habachi Steak. The manager said we didn't charge you for the steak but if you want it I can charge your credit card another 13 and deliver it to you. I said come and pick up the food you delivered and bring me the Habachi steak and just charge me 15. She said we can't do that, no we have to charge you again. So instead of paying 20 for a meal they're requesting I pay 33 total. That was the last time I'll ever order from them again. They're several other Asian restaurants in the area with better service and better food. This was that time when I knew exactly what I wanted to eat and didn't get it.
