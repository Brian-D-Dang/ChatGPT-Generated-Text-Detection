Jews, Christians, and Muslims all worship the same God (albeit quite differently). I think that using the word "Allah" in English does Muslims a disservice. It marks their religion as an "other" to Christians and Jews, rather than as the fellow Abrahamic religion that it is. Even in a secular context using foreign words can be self-ostracizing. Also I think there is a large set of people who don't realize that Islam's Allah and and Christianity and Judaism's God are one and the same. If Muslims used the word "God" more often it would probably be more clear, and perhaps lead to a little more understanding between the religions. Hello, users of CMV!
