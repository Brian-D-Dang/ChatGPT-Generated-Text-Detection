You are hearing your own voice through a medium referred to as "Bone Conduction." When you speak, the vibrations travel through your actual body, and you "hear" a different sound than someone else who hears the reverberations of the air. It's one of the reasons why people HATE listening to themselves sing because it feels foreign.','Short Answer: Bone conducted sound reaches the cochlea directly through the tissues of the head. So when you speak, the brain receives and combines the two pathways: 1. vocal chords to cochlea 2. (sound waves) external air conduction- external auditory canal- eardrum cochlea. Via the first pathway, the mechanical properties of your skull enhance deeper, lower frequency vibrations. When you hear a recording, its only the air-conducted pathway in isolation.
