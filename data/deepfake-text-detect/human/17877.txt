In the current first world model, its becoming normal for women to focus on higher ed and careers in their 20's and then start to think about having children in their late-20's and early 30's, or even later. I think delaying childbirth is leading to plummeting fertility rates. This is bad because in the future there will be a large imbalance between tax paying, goodsservices producing workers and retirees which will have overall negative consequences. See here for an explanation: Also, the population will become genetically inferior for 2 reasons: (1) More negative mutations will be passed on due to later childbirth (2) The women most likely to follow this trend are higher IQ, conscientious women. So, they are having few children than lower IQ, lower conscientious women leading to an "Idiotocracy." See here: I believe its ok for women to focus on children earlier because they live longer than men, so its not such a big deal if they start their careers later. So, to sum up: Having children earlier makes use of more of a woman's fertile years more likely to have more children adverts negative consequences of greater retireeworker ratio and strengthens genetics of the population CMV
