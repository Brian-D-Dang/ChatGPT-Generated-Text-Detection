First off: I believe medical marijuana should be legal. Everyone in the comments are defending the guy by saying " weed is just frowned upon because of the war on drugs" NO. In a profession that requires you to think fast and make decisive choices, you should not be under the influence of any mind altering drug. I will defend the guy when he said that the Mounties don't have a good PTSD screening program, but you must realize that in the chance that he receives a call for an armed robbery or a gun man, that he is not working at 100. He was also approached by Mounties, after he was fired, who offered him the idea of getting mental help. I know reddit is all "blaze it when ever you want to, it isn't as bad as alcohol and other drugs" but it would be very scary if a officer of the law was tasked with quickly defusing an hostile situation while high.
