She would've been 37 today. I picked up the pen in the morning and realised I can't imagine her at 37. I can't see her any differently than how she was the last time I saw her in the morning of the day she died. Every time I try to imagine crow feet in the corner of her eyes or white strands in her hair the image fades until a stranger stands in her place, a woman I don't know, a woman I'll never know. Today was a bad day. Her mother stopped talking to me five years ago when I refused to stop posting her images. Let her die, she said. Now there's no one to talk to on her birthday. I watched one stupid movie after another until the TV turned to static. It was close to midnight by then. I feel we have a connection, on her birthday. The minutes were ticking down and I was so scared I was about to lose her. I can't draw you anymore my darling. I don't want to forget how you look. Already started to forget the sound of your laughter. The bottle of pills and the wine are right here. First, let me put on that waltz you always liked. We'll need something to dance on. - -220
