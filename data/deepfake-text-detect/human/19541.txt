If China and India stop manipulating international trade, China by unpegging the Yuan and India by not being a cesspool of corruption, they will probably become the strongest consumer class in the world. If the West can't manage to become a producer than provider it will do terrible. Most of the West can - the US has oil and gas...Russia has oil and gas and food, Canada has oil and gas and food..Australia, however, just sends away raw products and doesn't capitalize on it's products as per the international economic paradigm...and lets just say it'll probably join the ranks of Africa and South America with it's own little realized resource curse.
