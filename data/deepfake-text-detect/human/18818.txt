First, I'm well aware of the fiasco that was 1989 on the cold fusion front. It was at the very least a disaster. However, since then, any scientist who so much as implies interest in the field, or any inclination to try the experiment, can have their entire credibility put into question, or be labeled a fraud, or a fringe scientist. On top of that, anyone who does research it, particularly those who DO find excess heat andor nuclear products are being disregarded without any real look into their results. (Even the MANY peer reviewed reports) My point is basically: And somehow people are still insisting the effect is fiction. Change My View?
