Just to note waking up with daily headaches can sometimes be a sign of a serious medical illness such as sleep apnea, increased pressure in the CSF (especially in youngoverweight women), or even a mass in the brain. A rule amongst medical professionals is that if a person has a "first or worst" headache, meaning a headache type that is new for them or that is the worst they have ever had, it should be worked up. I am glad you are feeling better but if you start having daily morning headaches again, please see a doctor:). This isn't to scare you it's very unlikely you have any of those things but there are some diagnoses you don't want to miss.
