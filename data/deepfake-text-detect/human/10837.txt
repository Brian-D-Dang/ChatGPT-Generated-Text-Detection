Unfortunately, there is probably no answer for this as of yet. While Ray Kurzwell will tell you that a fully functioning AI is "just around the corner," we still have no clue how consciousness works or what it even is. One theory on dreams is that they are your brain's and senses' attempt at understanding the random noise of information flooding your consciousness as you sleep, because the brain uses this time to consolidate memories and experiences. Your higher cognitive functions aren't fully on board while you dream, except for a few lucid dreams, it is mostly a passive observational experience. When you dream, the prefrontal cortex, an area that deals with logic and reasoning, is also undergoing maintenance, and it can't filter your thoughts through a "rational point of view" -sieve before you think them.
