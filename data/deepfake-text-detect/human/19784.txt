At one point, the issues that once was in society are more of a non issue at this point... The biggest issues were resolved when woman's gained the freedom and power to choose to engage in economic and social activities. Feminism was useful in bringing a number issues to light! But now... anything with feminism attached to it looks and feels toxic and any issue brought up goes unheard. I don't think there are any issues for women to legitimately complain about. Legitimately complain as in it truly is unfair systematically as opposed to good reasons for it to be so. In short... what issues still exist that really are issues? CMV.
