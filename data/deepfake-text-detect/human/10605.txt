There was a shooting by BART police of a homeless man. People were going to protest this shooting and BART decided to shut off service claiming that the potential protesters were planning on standing in front of trains and cause mayhem. Anonymous got involved somewhat. And the protesters have protested despite the cell service being turned off. There are likely going to be lawsuits against BART that will go on for a while. URL0
