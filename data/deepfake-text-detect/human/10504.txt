We don't know how gravity works. A lot of very educated guesses are in lines with the idea that every particle deforms space itself a little bit. Larger collections of particles deform things so much that the effect is measurable by us very easily. Outside of that, all we truly know is how strong gravity is. Many very advanced experiments, such as work being done at the Large Hadron Collider seek to understand gravity a bit more clearly, via a particle known as the Higgs Boson. Recently, researchers found direct evidence for the Higgs particle. It had existed only as a mathematical model prior to that. What this means for us, is that since we now know the particle is there, it is thought that the particle itself may play a role in "carrying" gravity. That is, it somehow makes gravity happen. This is EXTREMELY simplified, mind you. The idea is that particles interact with a universal mechanism (called the Higgs Field) which exists everywhere. The Higgs Boson is the key component that makes a particle have mass, and thereby interacts with the Higgs Field. Right now, it can't be said that we truly even understand WHY things have mass, while some other things don't. As for the moon, no thing has an effect on the gravity of another thing. Think of it like throwing stones into a pond. A big stone makes big waves, small stones make small waves. Each thing (planet, moon, person, etc) is its own stone that you throw into this pond. No stone directly changes the other, but their gravity interacts in the form of the waves on the pond. When you consider the moon and the earth together, they are both pulling one another towards themselves. The earth, being far larger, is only affected a little bit. The moon is pulled so much that it falls into orbit. The moons gravity still shifts things around on earth though, which is part of why we have tides, and a few other things.
