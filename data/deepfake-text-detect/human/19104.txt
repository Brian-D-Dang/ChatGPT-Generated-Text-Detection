Many American schools have adopted a campaign known as "Spread the Word to End the Word," advocating for the removal of "retard" and "retarded" being used in everyday conversation. The argument is that it is offensive to those with mental handicaps. I agree that using it derogatively against another human being is wrong. However, I don't see why we shouldn't use the term to refer to other things. "Ugh, Facebook's new design looks so retarded." Nobody saying that is thinking "Huh! You know, these CSS elements look like they may be suffering from Down Syndrome. I think I'll point out its cognitive disabilities." I think we should continue to use "retarded" in this manner, and make it lose its intellectual handicap form of use, thereby removing the insulting, hurtful nature. No campaign will stop people from calling things retarded. If we shift the use, it will take on new meaning and stop offending human beings. There's a precedent for this: Moron, Idiot, and Imbecile were once distinct terms to refer to people within particular IQ brackets. Now it just refers to someone foolish. I think we should encourage the use of "retarded," outside of a mental handicap context. CMV Edit: spelling
