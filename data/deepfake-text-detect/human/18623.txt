First of all, I would like to elaborate with some pretext: There is nothing inherently "less" about women. Women can be smarter than men, more capable in any way (except raw athleticism, but that doesn't really matter outside of the Olympicsthe few thousand professional athletes of the world). The smartest person to currently exist may well be a woman. The wisest may be a woman. However, based on my experience with the world, my knowledge of history and literature, leads me to believe that women are inferior. This, I think, is largely due to living in patriarchal societies that put the wrong sorts of emphasis on the female character which far too many females subscribe to. There are many women who transcend these "societal norms" and strive for more and achieve such. It's just that, by and large, the majority of women do not foster personal growth the way that men do. Men are not allowed to be trophy husbands, the "hot guy at the bar," or mere sex symbols (of course these types exist, but in a general societal sense, they are not taken as seriously as men who achieve more substantial gains). This has caused a larger percentage of men to develop themselves to a further degree than women. EDIT: I should clarify that women are collectively inferior.
