I believe that the openness of the Internet, while being one of its strongest assets as a forum for communication, also has the paradoxical effect of stifling critical discussion. [This article in the New York Times] adequately expresses many of my major concerns. Facebook and Twitter create a "like-seeks-like" mentality that, through the rigid curating of friends list and sponsored content, pushes dissenting opinion out of view. Reddit, with notable exceptions (CMV among them), encourages a crowd mentality whereby opinions that differ from those of the website's core demographics are likely to be downvoted into obscurity. The academic world, on whose shoulders perhaps the greatest obligation lies to disseminate accurate information to the public, largely fails in this responsibility. The insular nature of academia, combined with the sheer inaccessibility of many scholastic texts and resources, means that only those with significant amounts of time, energy, and preexisting knowledge can hope to converse with current academic debate. In short, I believe that, while freedom of speech finds perhaps its greatest expression in the Internet, this freedom also creates an informational diffusion whereby those who wish to engage with different opinions are limited to specific communities such as CMV and do not have a forum for addressing these differences in a public manner. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things. Firstly, please remember to [read through our rules] . If you see a comment that has broken one, it is more effective to report it than downvote it. Speaking of which, [downvotes don't change views] ! If you are thinking about submitting a CMV yourself, please have a look through our [popular topics wiki] first. Any questions or concerns? Feel free to [message us] . Happy CMVing!
