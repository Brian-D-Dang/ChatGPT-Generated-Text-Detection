"MINION." "Yes, s-s-sir..." "How are you still alive, when every one of my other minions seems to be, I don't know, DEAD?" "W-w-well, sir, it's a f-f-funny story..." "Well, I, the great and almighty Kraztar, Lord of Sheep, God of Bones, and Idol Connoisseur, DO NOT FIND YOUR STORY FUNNY SO FAR, GRUB." "S-s-sorry sir, I truly am incomprehensibly stupid" Kraztar sighed. "Just tell me what happened, Grub." "Well after you sent Alexandra, y-y-your dr-dr-dragon to kill the heroes of l-l-legend..." "Get on with it!" " ..... There was a hero from the group that decided to go alone, bringing only the magical sword of Arthkogdania and the armour of Geldrandhagia..." "Pardon me, Grub, sorry to interrupt, but are you telling me that a hero of legend has somehow acquired a sword that can actually kill me and an armour that doesn't make me stronger, going against the rumours I spread, and beating all my tactics that should have allowed me to beat everyone, including sending my strongest minions first?" "He also killed Jennifer, your s-s-sea serpent, sir." "Was she wearing her plexiglass goggles?" "Yes s-s-sir." "What the hell is this person" "YOU CALLED SIR? " "No, Hell, just another metaphor." "OH. " "So, Grub, was this person by any chance, hopping everywhere backwards?" "Y-y-yes, sir, how did you kn-kn-know?" "Grub, I want you to get every goblin (B), skeleton (A), and dark soldier (A) that I have summoned and move them all to the final chamber." " ..... Sir?" "And also all the mages that fire a gazillion bolts at a time. It's time for the corruption to take place." You called, sir? "A METAPHOR CORRUPTION, A METAPHOR."
