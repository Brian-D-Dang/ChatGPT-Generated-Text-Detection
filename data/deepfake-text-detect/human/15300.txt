Awful. Not friendly. Sold us wrong products. Employees clueless. Not a typical Camping World. If you have the opportunity to visit Mesa or another store, do it and save yourself a lot of headaches and money in returning the wrong merchandise - they recommended. It would be a rating of 0 - but not an option.
