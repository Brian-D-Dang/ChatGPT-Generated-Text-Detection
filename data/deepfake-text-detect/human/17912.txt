common, daily human intuition is common sense. You can look at an object either analogically or using physics. When you look at a ball falling down, you relate this phenomenon to every other object that falls down. That's reasoning by analogy. We do it everyday for every physical phenomena and we just move on and accept the analogical reasoning. As shown by our advances in physics, things clearly aren't that simple. Essentially, We 'make sense' of the world by not making sense whether intentionally or not. Also, we deal with what does scientifically make sense by treating at as absurd. Physics is full of these counter-intuitive concepts from general relativity to the under-appreciated basic but truly absurd idea of motion to the overly made obscure quantum and string theories.
