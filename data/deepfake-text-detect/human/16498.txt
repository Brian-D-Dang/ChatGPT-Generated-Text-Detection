HDBSCAN, a state-of-the-art density-based hierarchical clustering method, produces a hierarchical organization of clusters in a dataset w.r.t. a parameter m p t s. While the performance of HDBSCAN is robust w.r.t. m p t s in the sense that a small change in m p t s typically leads to only a small or no change in the clustering structure, choosing a "good" m p t s value can be challenging: depending on the data distribution, a high or low value for m p t s may be more appropriate, and certain data clusters may reveal themselves at different values of m p t s. To explore results for a range of m p t s values, however, one has to run HDBSCAN for each value in the range independently, which is computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach to compute all HDBSCAN hierarchies for a range of m p t s values by replacing the graph used by HDBSCAN with a much smaller graph that is guaranteed to contain the required information. An extensive experimental evaluation shows that with our approach one can obtain over one hundred hierarchies for the computational cost equivalent to running HDBSCAN about 2 times.
