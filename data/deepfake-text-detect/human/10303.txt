First of all, I do not like to believe this because I've been told over and over and over that it isn't true, but I keep seeing more and more evidence of it as the years pass (and in fact I feel a bit guilty for actually believing it, therefore this post), and second I'm speaking of average people here, I know there's asexuals and sex addicts, but those are the outliers, not the common case. What I see is that while for men sex is a need, like hunger and all (a need that doesn't kill us but instead makes us suffer if unsatisfied), for women it's more of a take-it-or-leave-it thing, something they can enjoy but that they don't really need, a nice thing to have but that doesn't really matter much if they don't have it, like, say, chocolate (although women would be far less willing to give up chocolate in my experience).
