First of all, english isn't my native language, sorry for mistakes I may make. I don't feel like abortion should be legal. Fetus is human in certain stage of development, like youth, adult or elder. We cannot set an objective criteria for allowing one to be killed, therefore we shouldn't do it at all. New human life starts when sperm connects with ovum, that's biology and that's all we need. Messing self-consciousness, nerve system, brain etc. with this is as arbitrary as to say that one is human when he has all 5 senses or when he's white or when he graduates high school. Only situation I can understand one's argument for legalizing abortion is when he says: I know I'm letting innocent people die by this law, but I don't give a f, because that's how I roll. I don't think there's more reasonable thing to say in defend of abortion. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
