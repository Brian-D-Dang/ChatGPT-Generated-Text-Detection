First some background, I'm a high school student at a very competitive college prep school in the United States. A large percentage of the class goes to ivy league and other very good undergraduate institutions in the United States. I think that getting into these colleges is one of the most important things in my life, and right now it's looming big as the early action deadline approaches. I think whether or not I get in will determine the level of success I achieve in the rest of my life. Change My View, show me, tell me why, going to such a college has isn't as significant as I make it out to be.
