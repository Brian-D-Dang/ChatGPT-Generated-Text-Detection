I like musicals. When I was little, I watched High School Musical and loved it. I sing, I dance, and I'm in a show choir that performs showtunes. Just from being around theatre geeks, I know most of the words to Can You Hear The People Sing...they all LOVE this musical. I've only seen the first five minutes of it, and I want to motivate myself to watch it again, but it just seems so....bland. Dull. Please CMV and convince me that I NEED to watch this. (I am, of course, referring to the 2012 version.) Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
