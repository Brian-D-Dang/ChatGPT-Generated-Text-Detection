Luther and his wife moved into a former monastery, "The Black Cloister," a wedding present from the new elector John the Steadfast (1525-32). They embarked on what appeared to have been a happy and successful marriage, though money was often short. Between bearing six children, Hans - June 1526; Elizabeth - 10 December 1527, who died within a few months; Magdalene - 1529, who died in Luther's arms in 1542; Martin - 1531; Paul - January 1533; and Margaret - 1534; Katharina helped the couple earn a living by farming the land and taking in boarders. Luther confided to Michael Stiefel on 11 August 1526: "My Katie is in all things so obliging and pleasing to me that I would not exchange my poverty for the riches of Croesus."
