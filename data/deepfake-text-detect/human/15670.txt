HAND PULLED NOODLES.... I have had these before in Hong Kong and Cali. Never expected in AZ. These are as fresh as you can get your noodles!!! Got the 18 - Beef with Oyster Sauce and I picked the standard ramen noodles. The noodles were good and the flavor of the beef and oyster sauce was outstanding!! The steamed dumplings were so so good. YUM YUM!!! Also ordered the milk tea with boboa (it was ok). The service was ok too. We were waiting for 2 more people to join us, they never came to take our drink order. They waited for everyone to get there and then took our drinks food order.
