Scientists have developed a new gene-editing tool that is more accurate than CRISPR-Cas9. Prime editing can mend about 89 percent of the 75,000 or so harmful mutations in the human genome that cause diseases. Researchers were able to use prime editing to make 175 different DNA edits to human cells with impressive precision, correcting mutations that cause diseases such as sickle cell anemia and Tay-Sachs disease. The same edits using CRISPR-Cas9 would leave insertions, deletions, and other genetic detritus that could interfere with the functions of the edited cells. More research is required before it can be safely used in humans.
