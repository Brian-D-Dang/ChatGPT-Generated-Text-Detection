The military (and military personnel) have another set of laws that they have to follow in addition to all the regular laws. This set of laws is called the Uniform Code of Military Justice (or UCMJ for short). It has a lot of normal stuff in it, and stuff unique to the military like going AWOL.', "Because in most jobs, you don't endanger national security by quitting.," "The Uniform Code of Military Justice lays out these rules. In fact, desertion can be punished by execution, but that rarely happens. When you are a soldier, you sign up for a certain amount of time. You are required to stay in the military for that amount of time. Then, it is your decision whether or not you want to stay afterwards. Basicaly, any military unit is a group of people who have been trained to work together and support each other. There are sepcialized members of each unit. The unit would not be able to effectively fight if the submarine helmsman left, or the guy who operates the Anti aircraft systems left, because they would have to train someone else to do that. They invested the training in you, you give them what they need and don't rip them off. Also, you don't abandon your shipmatesbrothers in arms. Ever. In any military force, that is equal to a mother abandoning their baby or a brother letting his brother get beat up by a gang. You rely on the other Marines, they rely on you, you all have different jobs to do to make the mission a sucess. I have no sympathy for deserters.," "Because the military isn't just an ordinary job. Soldiers are called upon to risk their lives, and a military unit would be completely ineffective if they just up and quit any time. So special laws govern the military, that don't apply to civilian life.
