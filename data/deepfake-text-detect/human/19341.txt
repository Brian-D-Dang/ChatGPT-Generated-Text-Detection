I'm a 26 year old guy with no musical background whatsoever. I had no technical interest in music until I was in high school. I realized I felt a deep connection to music and a strong desire to express myself (including musically) I taught myself music theory, but ran into a brick wall trying to train my ears, learn to sight read, compose music. I then re-read Seashore's Psychology of Music (which admittedly is rather dated) and a lot of what I read confirmed my experiences. I don't have exact references on hand at the moment, but he noted that it was possible to detect future music talent in people sometimes even before speech was developed. He was also continuously doubtful towards the effectiveness of musical training (at least the mental aspects) in musically untalented people. Personally, I have never known anybody who was musically talented who did not begin in their early childhood (often encouraged by musical parents). I'm taking a piano class at college now, and my dream is to be able to play even simpler pop songs like Elton John. At the moment, I'm convinced I'm going to quickly reach a limit with my improvement. I'm also unconvinced that fine motor tasks are easily acquired at my age. So I guess my official view is: I believe that as an adult who cannot sing and has had no musical training whatsoever, I will never be able to mentally conceive of melody and harmony and thus compose, that I won't be able to discriminate between pitches any more than I can now (or probably could when I was 5), and that my technical abilities are severely handicapped from the start.
