I can't really link to something, as I was watching a debate in Brazilian public television a couple years ago about the importance of water management. I've thought for a long time that we shouldn't bother with saving domestic water "for the environment," because our personal use volume is too small compared com agriculture or industry usage. We should save water to lower bills, and not have some fantasy that we were helping Earth by cutting bath time. This view was constantly challenged by friends saying that "everyone should do its part," but this didn't convince me - again, the volume is too small. Watching a debate, however, a specialist brought two important points that changed my view: All water we get in contact to is useless afterward and flushed back to the sewers. Water used in irrigation goes back to the natural cycle unharmed and almost imediatly. Industry recycles most of his water, be it used for cleaning or cooling, as it is more efficient than taking all the water they need from the network. Cities are getting bigger and bigger. That means that a tiny patch of land is responsible to a huge amount of water consumption, and we have to create increasingly complicated systems to fullfil this demand, with overreaching environmental consequences. Sao Paulo has two large dams, and still collects water from 50 km away to supply its ever growing population Sistema Cantareira] , in portuguese). I was impressed with these arguments, and am now an advocate for using fewer water to get rid of all our filth. If you disagree, I'm open to be again a pragmatical, get-rid-of-this-environmental-nonsense guy.
