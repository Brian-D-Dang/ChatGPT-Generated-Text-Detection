This is the only explanation for why an otherwise rational person would think that beating and hitting a child is the sole exception to the general rule against violence and domestic violence. Stockholm syndrome is when a captive feels sympathy for and defends a captor. Children are like "captives" of their parents and naturally feel love for their parents, whom they are powerless against. This love contradicts the child's natural outrage against being physically abused and very often, that outrage is suppressed. The suppression of outrage against violence against oneself desensitizes the individual to violence in general.
