"Dammit, Wally! Can't you ever come up with something new?" It's all I've heard my whole life. I can't help it. I like bricks! There's just something so final about them. And when I found out that I could just think of bricks, and'POOF!' there they were! Well it was the happiest day of my life! The second was when I saved the girl next door from some older bullys in 2nd grade. Oh, man, that kid had a lump on his head for a week after from the red rectangle of justice falling on his head. Too bad it also freaked her out too. But I knew what my true calling was from that point on. I would use my bricks to stop all of the bad people in the world! As soon as I was able, I applied to become a cop. However, they didn't take too kindly to my special power. I think the sudden brick wall that the cop car ran into during my training was really what did me in. Hey, I was nervous, okay?! But that's alright, I knew I could do it all by myself. So I had my Mom sew up an awesome red suit for me..... Okay, it's dyed long-johns. Shut up! But I was ready. I stumbled across a liquor store being held up at gunpoint one day. This was it! I quickly made a brick and threw it at the bad guy. I hit the gun, and both the brick and gun flew right into the beer display case, shattering it into a million pieces. The bad guy ran out the door, and heck I ran too! That store owner was furious I just broke his cabinet. But I just saved the day! He didn't care. Now I know what you're thinking...'Hey, can you make other stuff to fight crime?' Well, yeah I can. But what good is it to use feathers against a bad guy? Or a chihuahua? NO! Bricks are my thing, and will always be. Now I am off to rescue the day from the evil doers! And remember kids..... a brick a day keeps the bad guys away!
