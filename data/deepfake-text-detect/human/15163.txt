What is with the super high reviews for this place?! The food was SO mediocre and I felt disgusting afterwards. Two stars for the large portions and pretty fast service, but I couldn't even finish a quarter of my food. I split the chicken fried steak, biscuits and gravey and california omlette. Everything was super average. You know when you can tell if a dish is appetizing from the moment you see it? When I saw my chicken fried steak, I knew it was overfried, the quality of meat was NOT good, and the Cali omlette was simply too greasy and just overall Blah. The biscuits and gravy was hugeand just Not good. I can't even get into the specifics about the composition of the dish and the flavors, the meal was not worth the calories and grease. You'd think Vegas would have great bfast joints bc of the amount of hungover people in search for greasy hangover cures, but I was extremely disappointed here. The diner coffee and the country fried potatoes were the only good things about this place.
