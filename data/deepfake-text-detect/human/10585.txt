When you're poor and ashamed of being poor, trying to look like you aren't poor can seem really important to you. Some poor people decided to keep their hat brims unbent, and left the sticker on. This was to prove that they bought the hat new, rather than used from a thrift store. This trend grew very popular. Eventually, many people started emulating the style whether or not they were poor, simply because it was the popular thing to do.
