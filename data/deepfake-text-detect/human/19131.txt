I work beside an abortion clinic and all the time there are a group of women from a church that harass and hassle the women who come for abortions. Their main belief is that all children are children of God. With our foster system breaking at the seams and there being such a long wait time for families (especially permanent ones) for special needs kids, it seems disingenuous to not help those in need in favor of wanting your own. I believe these families who promote the all-children-need-a-life-and-family-to-love-them should first be adopting or fostering the child born with disabilities or FASD or older child before deciding to be fruitful and multiply, bringing even more children into the world. I feel it's hypocritical to tell someone they need to have a child they don't want, put it up for adoption, if they themselves aren't willing to adopt the child because they want to have their own.
