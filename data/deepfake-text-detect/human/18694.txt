I should start by saying that I live in the state of Florida, specifically in Miami Gardens (otherwise known as Carol City) which is one of [the highest crime locations in the city] Which already has a pretty bad record] . I've lived here all my life and have had my house burglarized on several occasions and throughout my life, I've lived around gangsters, drug dealers, junkies and thugs. I've been robbed at gunpoint and I personally have had friends and neighbors murdered. In summary, I live in a pretty horrible place, but I have no choice, as I don't have the funds to leave. I also own a handgun, as well as the appropriate legal permits to carry them. I believe that anyone who attacks me or threatens me is literally out to kill me, and I believe it is within my rights to shoot them immediately if they attack or threaten me. I don't start trouble, but if someone threatens to hurt me or my family, I will respond accordingly and shoot them dead as I believe it is within my rights and because I believe that if I give them the opportunity, they can kill me. How am I wrong? Change my view. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
