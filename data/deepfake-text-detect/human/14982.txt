I am a VrtuCar customer that made the mistake of sharing a car through this company when I made a trip to Montreal from Ottawa. I just got off of the phone with Communauto rep and I am very disgruntled. I booked the car though the VrtuCar website, so I assumed that everything would be paid through my VrtuCar account. This was not the case. I did not receive anything in the mail telling me to pay a Communauto bill, so I didn't think about it again until I went to log in today to book a car and am now kicked out of my account. I use this for work and needed to book it for a last-minute meeting. When I called VrtuCar, I was told to contact Communauto, which I did, and asked them if I could pay my bill over the phone. They don't do this. They told me to log in to my online banking (assuming I had this in the first place) and to pay online. I did and couldn't find them as a payee at first because they did not give me their full name to use (Inc.) I asked them if there was any other method of payment and the guy very rudely said Well, maybe you should just go into your bank and pay there! I eventually was able to see the error and found them listed, but they were very rude and very unhelpful. What a scam. I will NEVER be booking Communauto again. Their customer service is terrible. As a VrtuCar member, I would like to pass along my oh-so-wonderful experience so other VrtuCar members are warned before heading off for a weekend in Montreal
