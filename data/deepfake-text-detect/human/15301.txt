I came into a wealth of free bagel cream cheese bagel coupons, so I finally got a chance to check this place out. I'm usually not big on chain bagels, but I'm not going to turn down a free meal either. I tried to go once before but they close at 5pm on Sundays. The sign on the door is lightly confusing since it used to read 6 but the bottom left-hand corner of the 6 was obfuscated in order to make it appear as though it was a 5. I finally made it last week and had a whole wheat bagel with jalapeno cream cheese. The bagel was on par with the standard bagel you can get out of a bag at the supermarket. The jalapeno cheese was delicious and the highpoint of the meal. The people working there were friendly and accommodating. The main hangup was that the worker didn't offer to toast my bagel and, me thinking this would be standard didn't ask, left me with a pretty difficult to eat bagel. After I took one bite I really needed my water to wash down the dense bagel. In NYC you could probably eat untoasted bagels since they are really light and fluffy, but this one was a bit tough to swallow. I feel a conflict of interest when giving them only 2 stars since my bagel was free, but it'll have to remain at 2 until I get my next bagel (also gratis) before the coupon expires.
