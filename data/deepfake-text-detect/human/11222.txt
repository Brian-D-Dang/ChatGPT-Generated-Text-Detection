Large and mysterious land carvings have been discovered in India's Thar Desert. The geoglyphs may be the largest-ever graphical depictions designed by humans. They were discovered using Google Earth during a virtual survey of the region. The lines that make up the design are up to 10 centimeters deep and spread 20 to 50 centimeters wide. The largest geoglyph is made from a single looping line that runs for 12 kilometers. Another shape is composed of an 11-kilometer-long line. It is unclear what the meaning or function of the design is. The design is estimated to be at least 150 years old.
