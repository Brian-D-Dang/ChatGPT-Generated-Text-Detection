There are a few basic reasons why I'm not a fan of the Olympics: 1. They are very, very expensive. Most of that money is paid for by taxpayers of the host and other countries, but most of the benefit seems to go to the large corporate sponsors. This is especially problematic in countries that have a huge number of poor people, like in the upcoming Brazilian Olympics. 2. I don't really buy into the 'it brings nations together' argument because I think the Olympics encourage a kind of jingoistic nationalism that actually encourages, rather than discourages conflict. 3. I don't think we should be condoning the kind of monomaniacal obsession with perfection and 15 minutes of fame that most of the athletes have about their sport. Especially true of sports where the athletes are typically youngest and training takes over one's entire life (gymnastics is an example of this). 4. The Olympics are used for propaganda and to prop up despotic regimes. Extreme example is obviously the 1936 Berlin Olympics which Hitler used to trumpet the Nazis military might, but there are elements of this in many modern Olympics including China and Russia. 5. Similar to the above, even in democratic countries the Olympics are sometimes used by those in power as a distraction from real issues. For example, here in Canada we have a very controversial federal budget coming up, and the Minister of Finance andor Prime Mininister have decided to release it on Feb 11 - the day before the Men's Hockey Tournament is set to begin. As such, I think the Olympics are a bad thing and should be abolished. Change my view!
