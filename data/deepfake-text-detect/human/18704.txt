After watching the music video for "All about the bass," I've come to realize that this generation seems to be terribly insecure, and in need of constant platitudes and pick-me-ups in order to get by with day-to-day life. We seem to have to be constantly reminded in media that we are beautiful, intelligent, have potential, are worth love, etc, almost as if it's a mantra. We are easily offended, leading to the embarrassing cultural phenomena of trigger warnings, and we seem to me more likely to be victims of suicide or bullying. I honestly don't think that my grandparents' or even my parents' generation were anywhere near this soft emotionally. You never heard of things like anorexia or bullying being nearly as high in their time, and I definitely don't think anyone from back then would have had an emotional seizure from looking at squiggles on a screen. They didn't have to be told on a daily basis that they were awesome because they knew they were awesome. If someone bullied them, they were taught to fight back, not take the abuse. If someone called them ugly, they didn't kill themselves. Something changed along the line, though. I really can't say what it is for sure, maybe society encourages victims more so than it did in conservative times, or maybe i'm imagining it or connecting dots that don't exist. Change my view?
