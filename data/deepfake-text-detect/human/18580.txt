Every time I have bought a grass-fed steak, I have regretted it. They are tougher and stringier than most regular steaks, and have inferior marbling. On more than one occasion, I have noted that they have a more sour, acidic taste than grain-fed steaks. Grass-fed beef is more expensive, and the health claims surrounding them are dubious at best. At the same time, having your cows eat forage cuts costs, so customers are paying more for a product that less money went into producing. Without the questionable health claims and preachy hippie tract that comes along with grass-fed beef, I don't think it would be able to stay afloat in the market.
