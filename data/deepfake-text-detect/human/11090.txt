One walkway in my university is piezoelectric and It's really not worth it. The amount of energy generated over an entire day is enough to power a lightbulb for a few hours. They could stack multiple generators to capture more energy, but then the floor would deform alot when people were walking and it would be annoying to walk through "rubber-like" steps Everyday. A more practical solution to capture kinetic energy and convert it to electric energy are dynamos. Install them in bicycles and boom you got some useable power (though not alot).', "Yes, and it has been done. It's not a huge amount of energy, and if it were, it would make walking more difficult by reducing the rebound of each step.
