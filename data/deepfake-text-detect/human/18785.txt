Edit: I'm liking for specific instances where torture arguably was the moral thing to do, not some hypothetical ethical situation. Edit 2-Edit harder: Thanks for the responses. I've been looking over them and I agree I could have worded the question better, but it appears most of you guys understood what I meant. I love ethical philosophy and have been studying it at college, and you folks seem to be well informed in multiple ethical schools of thought. Thanks again.
