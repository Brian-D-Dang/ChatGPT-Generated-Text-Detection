First of all. I think that raising awareness is definitely necassary but I don't see the need for me to actually feel sad and impact my mood negatively when I'm not even affected by it myself. I'm not a cold hearted person people actually would describe me as nice and loving. Many years ago back in middle school we had the taks to read and eventually discuss how we feel about it about a story which describes how animals are suffering because of our consumption. The teacher expected us to feel sad and therefor criticize our consumption but was quite shocked when I told her that I didn't feel anything for the pig in the story. I mean if I saw that pig grow up in a public zoo which I frequently visit (or if it was my pet) then I would be affected by it's death or suffering but if an individual pig (or human for that matter) I never heard of before dies or suffers I don't see the need to feel bad at all. I find raising awereness mandatory however campaigns often try to receive attention by spreading sobstories and drama. When telling about such stories people often are shocked when I don't react affected and think that I'm cold hearted but honestly if I would take every single misery I hear about to heart I would simply break and couldn't sleep at night although not having problems myself.
