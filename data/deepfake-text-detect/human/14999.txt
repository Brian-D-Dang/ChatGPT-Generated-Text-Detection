BEST Creme Brulee in the world... well at least so far..that I have tried. It had banana and the bottom was lined with chocolate. Pure unadulterated heaven! Came here via the Urban Spoon App..otherwise I would have probably never stumbled upon this gem. Shrimp cocktail fresh and excellent. Mahi mahi tacos, tasty! Service quick, friendly, efficient. Tiny little place..size of a large living room..walls cluttered with badly framed movie memorabilia and such. 2 Large screen TVs, nice lighting. Its like someone turned the man cave into a dining room. lol. I will most certainly be back... if just to force the creme brulee on all that I know.
