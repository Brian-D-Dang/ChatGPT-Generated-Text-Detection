Troy was pretending to be a wizard like his favorite movie. Putting on a bathrobe and using a towel to make a wizard hat. He waved his imaginary wand to and fro, casting spells. His mother walked in, saw what he was doing, and broke into laughs. Frustrated, Troy tried his best to cast a spell on her, but didn't.
