I think we all have seen a situation where this occurs, you are watching a commercial for a new cell phone, or piece of technology and when the people look at the screen to captureplayback image or video it looks crystal clear in the best possible way. Especially photos. An example is the very phone I use, the Galaxy Note 4: Here is another with the LG G3: Could someone please educate me on why this is not frowned upon more often? I feel as a consumer we are not being told the whole story when something is "simulated." EDIT: Thank you for the replies everyone. I'd say my view is somewhat changed due to the explanation of the difficulty of filming a cell phone screen. However, I still think this is used to further enhance the image. Hello, users of CMV!
