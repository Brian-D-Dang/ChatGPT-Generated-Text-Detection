Currently, cars in the US are required to have steering wheels, mirrors, and foot pedals. The US Department of Transportation issued a statement saying that it "intends to reconsider the necessity and appropriateness of its current safety standards" to accommodate autonomous vehicles. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao believes that the new technology could save many lives, citing a statistic that 37,000 died in car crashes last year in the US. The DoT is also removing the 10 "official test site" designations created by the Obama administration, now self driving cars can be tested anywhere and still qualify for the 60 million in congressional grants set aside for autonomous driving technologies.
