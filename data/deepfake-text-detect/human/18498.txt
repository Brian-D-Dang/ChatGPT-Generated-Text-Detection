Let me give you an example: Bob works at a bike shop repairing bikes for 8hr, he's been doing it for 20 years and barely making ends meet. One day he decides he's had enough and thinks he can do it on his own. He doesn't go to school or take a class, he goes into his bank account and invests every single penny he's made in those 20 years, except for a few months rent to survive. So for 3 years he works alone, making LESS than 8hr and is severely in debt, but he marches on. Finally, after 3 long years of working 16hr days and making almost no money, he starts hitting it big. Into year 5 of his business, Bob is now a multimillionaire, he's hired about 1000 employees over that time and pays the average employee around 8hr. Now Bob's business is international, he's a billionaire. He decides while his average worker earns 20,000year, he's going to take in a bonus of 50,000,000 on top of his yearly salary of 50,000,000. My question, what in the bloody hell is wrong with that? HE struggled and worked his ass off and HE took the risk, HE created a business and jobs that would have otherwise not existed so in my opinion, it's HIS cake and if he can stuff his face with it if he wants. If Bob didn't exist, the employees wouldn't even have jobs, if Bob wanted to pay them 5hr that's his right, is it not? To me it's no different than walking into McDonalds, buying a large size of fries, and walking by homeless people. You have absolutely no obligation into splitting your fries with all the homeless people (and most people dont), but a CEO is expected to split his fries with his workers? If a CEO is making 10,000 or 100,000 what his employees are making, then they have a choice to leave. tl;dr - If you built something, it's yours
