Most of them relocate to other areas. This happens in a number of ways. - The molecules that they are in decompose into a gas that is given off and blows away. - The molecules they are in get eaten by bacteria, bugs, worms, maggots or other little beasties. These often turn into adult bugs, worms, maggots and other beasties and travel away, or get turned into stuff that kind of liquefies and gets digested further in other plants or animals. - They stay behind and, over many years, are washed away or moved away by land or water movements, including movements such as getting sucked up as nutrients into trees. - They stay behind and crumble into the regions of soil around them or are washed away by water movements. Most bones eventually do this. - A very few get transformed into rock or petrochemicals, which creates fossils or coal.', "Nothing happens to the atoms themselves, they just form other kinds of molecules. But the atoms are unchanged. It's sort of like when you are in school and you break for summer vacation. The class is no longer there, but nothing happened to the students - they just went on to do other things.
