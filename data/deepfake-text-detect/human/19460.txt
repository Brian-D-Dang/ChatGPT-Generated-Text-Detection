This is my first time posting, and I'm not very good at debate, but I've seen this sub actually change people's minds before, and I think I need that right now. So, as GamerGate was hitting popularity, I started to wonder why there was so many white males behind the movement. I was seeing 85 of the GG supporters weren't PoC or women. Then I realized that the same people self-identified as gamers much more than other groups. Then I thought about what actually constitutes a gamer. It's just someone who plays games, right? But millions of people play video games! Why would people label themselves something like that? That's like saying you're a reader or you listen to music. So it's basically meaningless. P.S. I don't actually really care about GG anyway, just explaining why I formed this view in the first place. P.P.S. I'm not opposed to gamers either, I play console and PC games. I only think it's meaningless to call myself or other people gamers. Hope I explained my point well... Why I changed my view: I have had this explained to me multiple times now, but calling yourself a gamer means you want people to know you treat gaming as a pastime or hobby. It says you're willing to sink time into gaming, and dedicate yourself. My entire viewpoint was based on my (wrong) idea that being a gamer simply means playing a game more than once. Thanks for all the comments, though, and I'm glad I understand now. Sorry about my really bad debate skills, they're definitely downvote worthy. Hello, users of CMV!
