Firstly I think I should point out that I don't wish for anyone to get significantly injured where they would have to go to hospital. I just happen to think that everyone needs to get a good ass kicking at some point in their life. I think it builds character. I know this can also create negative aspects such as revenge, depression, paranoia and manipulative behaviour. But it also gives an individual a sort of humbling in a realistic way. The world can be rough and things don't always have to go the way you wan't them to; you don't always come out on top. I think my main point is that everyone needs a form of humbling in their lives; and getting an ass whooping is the easiest way. Whatever negative things that arise can be fixed and everyone involved can become a better person. There is nothing more annoying than some douche bag who has an over-inflated ego. Change my view.
