It always seems to me like Goku is portrayed in such a positive, heroic light. I do not agree with this. Goku seems to enjoy fighting and I believe he actively tries to instill this in his children. Particularly during the Cell saga when, not only is willing to push his son into fighting the most dangerous foe they had ever faced, and chose to not help him in the fight, and keep others from aiding Gohan, and still watch as Gohan is being beaten and crying in front of him. To top all this off, instead of at least having Gohan fight Cell in Cell's current state, he goes as far as to assist the person that could kill his son by giving Cell a sensu bean. This is neglectful, dangerous parenting that holds no benefit, and Goku is only interested in showboating how tough his son is, at the risk of his son being murdered. Please change my view. TL;DR I believe Goku is a bad father because he is a showboating, childish person who values fighting to such a degree that he is willing to endanger his sons life by healing the opponent, and keeping others from aiding his son.
