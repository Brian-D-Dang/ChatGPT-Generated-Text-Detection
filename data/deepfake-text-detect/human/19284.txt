Any death is a tragedy, but its how you respond to that event that matters. Preventing future deaths and future tragedies is part of that response. I believe that the best solution to the September 11th attacks in 2001 would have been to selectively bomb Al Qaeda and its supporters including the Taliban. This would have accomplished the US's main goals as stated by President Bush (revenge for America and eliminate Al Qaeda leadership and terrorist capabilities). The resulting two wars not only cost more American lives than were originally lost on the attacks but also cost the United States dearly when it comes to international relations, clout, and the economic treasure and stability. These results, in my view, completely overshadow the horror of 911 and furthermore I believe that almost any limited response would have been better than the actions taken by former President Bush.
