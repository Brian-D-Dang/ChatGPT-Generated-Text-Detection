This is mostly a problem I have with bigger subreddits (75k subs). For example, on AskReddit, "what's the scariest fact you know?" gets reposted about once a week. On this subreddit, something related to feminism or "college sucks" gets posted three days it seems. I'm OK with reposts in general. I like seeing new perspectives on the same topics. However, there is a point where the same stuff pops up so often that it gets in the way of other content. Given the frequency of the reposting, half the time, the same stuff is regurgitated. For example, I see UVB-76 discussed in half of all "scariest fact" posts. As someone who's heard of UVB-76 multiple times, it is no longer interesting to me; thus this detracts from my enjoyment of the subreddit. Sure, I can find other threads not related to "scariest facts," but oftentimes they get squeezed out by popular reposts; they are either few of them (when there are many popular reposts at once) or the reposts attract more commenters more than other, more unique posts. I think the best solution would be to follow rpolandball. I rarely find a comic there that I don't find enjoyable. They have a strict repost policy whereby reposts are only allowed if the content in question has not been posted in the last 8 months. This strikes a balance between allowing reposts and not letting them be annoying.
