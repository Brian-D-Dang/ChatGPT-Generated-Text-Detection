Many countries have similar laws, which have led to strong turn out numbers at the polling booths. People have claimed, in post-polling surveys, that they have "strong opinions" on the person they voted for, and they may not have voted without these laws in place. Many people find it inconvenient or irrelevant to vote, but it is a person's civic duty and allows for the elected official to truly be an accurate representation of the populous' opinion. These laws would encourage people to become more involved in the political process as well. People who might otherwise ignore a national election would do research to prepare, because they know they will be forced to vote for somebody. The people have to pay taxes to the government and attend school because it betters the country. Compulsory voting laws would follow that same principal.
