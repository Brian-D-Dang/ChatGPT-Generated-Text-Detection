I'm only familiar with Massachusetts, and your answer changes from state to state. Here in MA, everyone's employer pays into a fund. That fund is where most benefits (your weekly unemployment) comes out of. They pay into this whether or not someone who works there gets laid off, so it's not like your own company is paying for you specifically. They're just paying a tiny portion of EVERYONE's weekly benefit, and they pay it no matter what, even if they have never laid off a single employee. If you get an extension, that comes out of tax money, so everyone pays a tiny portion of everyone else's extended weekly benefits. This is oversimplified, and there's math involved, but that's my understanding of the basics.," "It's an insurance scheme that is run jointly by the states and the Federal government. Employers pay the premiums on the insurance policy, and you get the benefits if you get fired. So, your employer has been paying for this insurance the entire time you were employed; it won't directly cost them any more if you collect the benefit (assuming you are eligible).
