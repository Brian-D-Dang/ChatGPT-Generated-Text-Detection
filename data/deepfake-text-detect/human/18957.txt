For those of you who don't know what LMGTFY is: . People link to this site when I post a question that can easily be Googled. However, usually, I know that this is a question for Google and not Reddit or my Facebook friends, but generally, if I ask a question on Facebook, I don't have time to Google it and look through half a dozen posts before finding one that is suitable. If you think I should ask Google instead of facebook, you should say "Just Google it" rather than linking to LMGTFY. EDIT: If I ask Facebook a question that can be answered by Google, I expect someone who doesn't know the answer to either say "Just Google it" or not to comment at all. If I'm asking Facebook, I expect someone on my friends list to know the answer. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things. Firstly, please remember to [read through our rules] . If you see a comment that has broken one, it is more effective to report it than downvote it. Speaking of which, [downvotes don't change views] ! If you are thinking about submitting a CMV yourself, please have a look through our [popular topics wiki] first. Any questions or concerns? Feel free to [message us] . Happy CMVing!
