GitHub Actions is a CICD tool that runs alongside code in GitHub. It can cut release times down to five minutes and revert releases with the touch of a button if any issues come up. There are more than 13,000 pre-written and tested workflows and pre-built automations in the GitHub Marketplace. This article talks about how GitHub Actions works, how it can improve workflow, and different GitHub Action workflows for common use cases. A video showing how to create custom GitHub Actions is available.
