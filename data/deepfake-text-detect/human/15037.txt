These guys are pretty good (and cheap!) for a no-nonsense gym. No pool, no group classes, just a bunch of ellipticals, weights, and treadmills. For the low cost per month, it's a good deal. They provide cleaning solution and paper towels to wipe down the machines after you're done. I have previously been to gyms that make people provide their own towels to wipe down with, and I find this much more sanitary. Four out of five stars only because they're only open 7am to 7pm on the weekends.
