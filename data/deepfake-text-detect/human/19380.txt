I agree that they will be popular with the gamers who game by themselves but for any other activity that you normally do with other people in the same room: Wii-type multiplayer games, sports, movies, ect I really don't see it happening because the headset cuts off your communication with everyone around you. As a result, you can't share the excitement and fun of what you're doingwatching with anyone else. Your essentially trapped in your own world. What the phone rings? What if someone needs to talk to you? Sure you can have headphone and mics attachments but only the uber-gamer is going to go for that. Which as I said previously, is the only market this device will have in the first place. So unless you watch a lot of movies by yourself, or watch sports by yourself, or always game by yourself...I don't think a VR headset is going to have long-term appeal to you. Hello, users of CMV!
