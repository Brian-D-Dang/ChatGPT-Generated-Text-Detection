Okay, maybe not EVERYBODY, but at least enough people speak English that you can get around easily if you travel there. I have wanted to learn another language, but the languages that I am interested in are spoken in places where English is a common language andor I do not plan on going there. Whenever I try to learn a new language, I give up fairly early on not because it is hard, but because I find it useless. Also, I'm not talking about "international" languages such as French, Spanish, German, Arabic, etc. that are spoken in many countries. I am talking about languages spoken in one or two countries where English is commonly understood (e.g. Dutch, Italian, Swedish, Japanese, Korean, etc.) or even minority languages where manymost speakers know another language (e.g. Basque). I have always wanted to become a polyglot, but I can't seem to find the motivation to learn a new language.
