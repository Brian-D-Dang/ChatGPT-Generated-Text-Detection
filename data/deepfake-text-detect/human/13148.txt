"El! El! " , someone screams in the distance. Seems like they're calling for me. "El, can you hear me?" I turn around. It's Tim, my best - and only - friend. Should I talk to him? I'm already late for work..... but he's done so much for me. I walk up to Tim. "Hey. What's up?" "El! God bless you!" He's clearly on the edge of crying. "Tim, what's wrong? What happened?" "My boss..... My boss..... He..... He reported me." "To the Org? " , I ask in utter disbelief. This is the third time Tim got reported in a week. Nobody can be this cruel. "To the Org. I..... I'm tier 4 now. How will I pay for air? You know how much it costs for this tier, don't you? What can I do?" "You know what? I'll give you some of mine. Tier 2 price. I already get plenty of air from my boss anyway. Dunno about water and food, though, I'm sorry." "THANK YOU SO MUCH, YOU SAVED MY LIFE! " , he shouts. I've never seen anybody this relieved in the twenty-five years I've spent on this planet. "Here, have a sip. Now I must run, can't be late for work. See you soon." "See you." Just at the door of my work, a tall man stops me. He wears an Org uniform - this can't be good. "Eleanor Martinez?" "Yes." "I'm Commander Smith. Come with me." He takes me to a nearby police station. There are five others at the station. Two of them seem to be officers, the rest are probably some criminals. Am I a criminal too? I am, but how could they know? "Eleanor Alyssa Martinez, do you know this man? " , Commander Smith enquires, and promptly shows me a picture of Tim. "I do." "Bring him in," the commander orders one of the officers. "Yes, sir," he says, and opens a door I haven't even noticed until now. In steps Tim. "Timothy Adamczyk, did this woman sell you a unit of air, circumventing the government pricing and rationing system? " , the commander asks. "Yes, she did." "Ms. Martinez, do you plead guilty?" "I do," I reluctantly say. "Oh, and Tim. Fuck yourself." "I'm sorry, El! I'm sorry," he cries, but I don't want to listen. He betrayed me. It only took a couple of minutes to decide on the verdict. They will shut off my air tomorrow. Tim falls down to tier 7 as a punishment, but he'll become tier 2 again in just a month. The fucking snake just couldn't keep his mouth shut, could he? [ Remark: I feel like this is absolute rubbish, but I promised myself that I wouldn't throw out anything I write while practicing, so here it is. ]
