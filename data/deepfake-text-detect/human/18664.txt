Sorry for the inflammatory title but that's essentially how I feel. To clarify: I do not mean any specific piece of legislation ever proposed or passed, I mean the general idea that the background of aspiring gun owners should be looked into to ensure that guns are not being sold to those convicted of violent crimes (or whatever other criteria law sets for gun ownership). I would understand the opposition if it was the case that people were afraid that the government could use the effectiveness of the checks to impose much stricter criteria for gun ownership. So let's just assume I understand this and let's also assume for the sake of argument that somehow we could ensure that such criteria would not become unfairly strict. It seems to me, that if the only group that were prohibited from legally purchasing guns was people who have been convicted of violent crimes, opposing background checks only serves to aid individuals who have proved to be violent in their search for weapons with which they can do more harm to society. Unless your position is that all ex-convicts have reformed themselves (some do, most don't) or that violent offenders should still be allowed to buy guns there seems to be no good reason to oppose background checks in general. (Again, I'm avoiding the subject I mentioned earlier, that background checks would allow for stricter gun laws. This is obviously true and a valid reason to oppose background checks, but I've always been under the assumption that there was something more to it.)
