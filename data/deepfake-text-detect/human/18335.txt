Please leave the footnote below the following line, but remember to delete this sentence by replacing it with the body of your post. Thank you! Racism exists in America. I know that, and I know it's an issue. Police brutality exists in America, and I know that it's an issue. However as a white male, I attended a protest for the police shooting of Akai Gurley, and I had to leave very quickly because it wasn't really a protest of police brutality, it was a protests against white police brutality. There was a very distinct "us vs them" mindset, that was very apparent. All of the anger built up, and finally there was a white male in their midst. It was very uncomfortable for me, and probably would have been dangerous if I had stayed. Even further, I saw several Facebook posts circulating about keeping black friday 'black' and not shopping at any white stores, or just not shopping at all. Again, I realize racism is a bad thing, but I feel as if creating an us versus them attitude only makes the situation worse. Now I am not anyone special, and I don't have a magic pill for stopping racism, but CMV and show me that these protests are actually helping, that they mean something. Hello, users of CMV!
