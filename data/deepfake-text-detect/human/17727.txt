So i've been thinking about this recently and I am currently of the mindset that the overwhelming majority of issues that humanity faces are self imposed (i.e. militarypolitical conflict, climate change, hunger, education, dietary diseases, etc.) I'm convinced we (humanity) have the resources to solve these problems, but the majority of people do not want to make the short term sacrifices to achieve these reciprocally beneficial long term goals. There are certainly other issues that humanity faces such as disease, or weather catastrophes (tornados, earthquakes, tsunamis, etc...) that are not caused by humans, but overwhelmingly, most of the issues are.
