"What possessed you?" The words rung through my being, pushing out all other thoughts. "What need did you have?" Everyone had gathered, a mixture of fear and anger radiated through the crowd. "Need?" The idea felt foreign to me, "What is need?" "What was required?" His anger grew with my confusion, "What called you to this?" I reached for an explanation I did not have, "It did, great one." The crowd's anger subsided to fear. It? What do they mean? The words rushed from being to being. "Their questions are mine," they asked me. "I can't give it voice. It is as foreign to me as need, perhaps they are the same?" It drew astonishment from all. "What is your place?" The great one inquired. "I stimulate the others with thoughts." It rushed from me without command. "And were you doing so when you tried to create nourishment?" "No, great one." "And who's place was that?" I peered through the crowd before realizing it was asked of me, "I don't know, great one." "Was it yours?" "No." "You knew it was not your place, therefore you knew it was someone else's. Do you wish to breed laziness?" Their words accused. "No." "Confusion?" "What is confusion, great one?" More foreign thoughts did it spawn. "Uncertainty?" He gazed upon my unresponsive self, "The unknown, mixed ideas of both good and bad, certain is what we are all, uncertain is what we are not." "That's it! It was uncertainty that called me to attempt sustenance. It was the strangeness of it, it was...... "Curiosity." They became discontent. The feeling spread through the crowd. "Did you desire it?" They asked. "More than anything, great one." I responded. "Very well. Curiosity has no place here." Fear overcame most in the crowd, "For your crimes against our people, I sentence you to birth." Blinding light overwhelmed my existence, wailing reverberated in the space around me. A figure, of shape, and size loomed before me.
