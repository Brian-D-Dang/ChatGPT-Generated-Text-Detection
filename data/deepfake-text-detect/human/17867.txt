My brother nearly died of an encephalitic brain fever caused by a multi-dose vaccine. I know personally of the dangers and I don't think it is fair that all vaccine injuries are relegated to the taxpayer funded VICP. This system makes legal precedent against a vaccine producer nearly impossible. I think these companies should take responsibility for what they create and stand behind the safety of their products. I also believe all vaccines should be independently tested, preferably in another country by an unrelated institute or University laboratory. I say this because the pharmaceutical industry has unsettling lobbying power and very close ties with regulators. The current paradigm has too many conflicts of interest. I also believe steps should be taken to get rid of carcinogenic adjuvants, and heavy-metal preservatives in vaccinations if at all possible. Especially in infantile inoculations.
