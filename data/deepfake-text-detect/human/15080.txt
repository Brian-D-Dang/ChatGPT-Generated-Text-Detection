Let me start by saying that having come from the San Francisco Bay Area...I'm spoiled by all the awesome choices for food and services. But being new to Phoenix, it's been a challenge to find all the good stuff. I hope my YELP's will help other newbies I must have tried no less that 7 nail salons before I found Oceans. This place is great. They have 10 spa pedi chairs and 8 nail tables as well as a cute nail drying station for your toes. THE best pedi I've ever had, anywhere. There is no timer on the pedi, or the massage. They take the time they need to satisfy each client. I've had 6 or 8 different girls and they were all really good. I also use them to do my gel nails too. I'm a little surprised that in Phoenix they charge extra fro the gel coat, but I guess that's what they do. Overall, good prices and the service is excellent! Discount for cash!!
