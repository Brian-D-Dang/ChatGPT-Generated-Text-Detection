So I watched the [announcement by Elon Musk of the new home energy storage solution, the Powerwall] . I'm certainly not a tech expert, and I know that this technology isn't revolutionary, but it really does seem to be a well-packaged, reasonably priced piece of technology that is the first of it's kind to be marketed in such a way. I think this will have a similar affect on the market for home batteries as the iPhone did for smartphones (not necessarily to the same degree). Like the iPhone, it is not necessarily revolutionary technology in itself, but it is constructed in such a way that it may be capable of being the product that makes people realize that they want a battery like this. And even if it isn't economically feasible for a lot of people right now, it will stimulate demand and initiate competition in the field so that prices will drop and value will increase. Ultimately, I think that this could be a big, big step towards the feasibility of sustainable energy like solar and wind being domestically produced and consumed on large scale. Hello, users of CMV!
