Elon Musk has told several of his close friends and associates that he is planning to move to Texas. Musk put his Californian houses on the market and expanded operations in Texas this year. He spends most of his time between Austin and Boca Chica. California has seen an exodus of notable tech names in the last year as companies cut costs and shift to remote work. Musk has frequently complained about California's policies. Moving to Texas, a state with no income tax, could save Musk billions of dollars.
