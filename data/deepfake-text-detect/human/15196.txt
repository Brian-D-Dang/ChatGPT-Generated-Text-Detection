flavors are great but every time I come this location it is disgusting! machines are dirty, the floors are dirty, topping area seems to never be fresh.... disappointing since this is the closest location to our house... I dont understand stand why they have a tip jar for a SELF serve place? if you're going to except tips I expect the counters to be at least wiped and greet me when I walk it...
