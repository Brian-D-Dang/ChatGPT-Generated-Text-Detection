Undergraduate admission to Harvard is characterized by the Carnegie Foundation as "more selective, lower transfer-in." Harvard College accepted 5.3 of applicants for the class of 2019, a record low and the second lowest acceptance rate among all national universities. Harvard College ended its early admissions program in 2007 as the program was believed to disadvantage low-income and under-represented minority applicants applying to selective universities, yet for the class of 2016 an Early Action program was reintroduced.
