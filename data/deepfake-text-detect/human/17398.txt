Okay, so I would never let anyone know this publicly, hence the post, but I really did enjoy Battlefield Earth. The acting is pretty poor, but it is at least a decent Sci-Fi movie, with a good amount of action. I liked the thought of post-war America, has some shout outs to ft hood, knox, and a couple other famous cities. The learning machine allows the humans to become intelligent, travolta getting his comeuppance at the end. I gotta say, if it is on, I tend to watch it. Just to Give a Primer, my 5 favorite movies of all time (in no particular order) Shawshank, Godfather, Inside Man, Animal House, Goodfellas
