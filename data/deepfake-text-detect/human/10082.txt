I'm sure we've all seen and heard of police officers who were aggressive and violent while on duty, but much less frequently do we hear of officers who have friendly interactions with civilians when there is no clear or present danger present. I've seen a few videos on the internet of cops dancing at block parties or playing a short round of cards in a park but none have gone viral like [this video] of an NYPD officer dancing at the NYC LGBT pride parade this past weekend. The general consensus is polarized; some people like myself are perfectly fine, even happy, that some officers are finding enjoyment and positive interactions with civilians in their day-to-day work rather than hostility and aggression; others feel that this interaction was completely unprofessional and that the officer should be fired or at least punished. I believe that the officer shouldn't face any punishment for simply dancing with a civilian for less than 20 seconds at a parade with clearly no imminent threat or danger present. My logic behind this is that many officers won't be punished for using excessive force or even wrongfully killing someone, so why should an officer be punished for taking 20 seconds to dance with a friendly civilian at a parade. Even if we lived in a world where excessively violent officers were rightfully punished, I would still be angry if this cop were to be punished for dancing at a parade. Hello, users of CMV!
