When in contact with an allergen (something that can trigger an allergic reaction) your inmune cells release histamine. Histamine triggers some nasty effects like inflamation and bronchoconstriction by binding to certain receptors in the cell walls called Hisatmine receptors. Antihistaminics work by either blocking the receptor to prevent histamine from binding to it or by binding to the receptor in a way that triggers the opposite effect of histamine (thereby, reverting the effects). Drowsiness is caused because certain antihistaminics (called 1deg gen antihistaminics) will trespass the blood-brain barrier (a filtering mechanism that blocks the passage of a lot of substances from the bloodstream to the brain). In the brain, 1deg gen antihistaminics depress the nervous system. 2deg Gen antihistaminics like loratadine won't trespass the blood-brain barrier and therefore won't make you sleepy.," " why is the drowsiness in Benadryl benefit It's not a benefit, it's a side-effect. Diphenhydramine was originally invented back in the 40s and was one of the first drugs of its kind so the side-effects were deemed acceptable because there were no other drugs that could knock out allergies the way it did. 2nd Generation antihistamines (Claritin, etc) have been available OTC for over a decade and have minimal side-effects and work for 24 hours. There's not much of a reason to take diphenhydramine unless you want the side-effects.," " I feel like if the body is awake fighting the allergy, it's better. You have it backwards how allergies work. Allergies occur when your body mistakes something harmless, such as pollen, for a germ and reacts accordingly. Thus, your body fighting the allergen is, in fact, the entire problem.," "When you're allergic, something, like pollen triggers immune cells in your airways to release histamine. Histamine triggers inflammation. Anti allergy medication are called antihistamines, because they counteract histamine release.
