Hello I believe people should be able to be as toxic as they want to trolls and feeders in ranked LoL. Right now people who are 'toxic' get punished. But the people who should get punished are the ones that make people toxic. For example, you have time to play one game before you have to do chorespick up the kids. You play a ranked game because they're supposed to be more serious. You get a troll that counterpicks themselves. Plays horribly, dies 10 times to the enemy and then goes afk. You should have every right to yell out the player who not only wasted your time, but the time of 3 other people in your team. They make the game no longer fun, because from the moment you play you pretty much had a 10 chance of winning instead of 50 because they purposely picked a character that would lose against the enemy's lane. When they go ahead and prove how right you are about them losing horribly, you should have even more right to bitch them out because there's no point playing that game anymore. It's pretty much impossible to win now because the enemy has such a lead from them. We should be able to take joy in bitching them out in return for the joy that was taken from us when they decided to outplay themselves from the get-go. These people who decide they want to have 'fun' feeding 20 times because they were losing. Or have 'fun' because they're dead set on playing a champ that isn't viable against what they're laning against are the people that cause others to become toxic. Even if they weren't in the first place. Because they pretty much singlehandedly decided to lose the game for you before the game even starts. So if they make people toxic, why shouldn't people act toxic towards them? Why shouldn't we go on about how bad they are and how they lost us the game, when they did play that badly and did lose us the game? It's like poking an animal with a stick and punishing the animal because it decided to bite back.
