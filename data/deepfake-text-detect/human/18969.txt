Buddhism is just another form of escapism I've been reading a lot of nietzsche and nietzsche seems to be focused on the life affirming, endure through suffering type lifestyle while buddhism seems like an unconvincing idea of escapism, quick fixes, harmony or bliss. Some would argue and say that buddhism is about wisdom and a peace mind, a peace mind will lead to better coping with life but i doubt that a peace mind is exclusive to buddhism i think learning to live with life as it is much like how nietzsche describes will leave you better off in the long run.
