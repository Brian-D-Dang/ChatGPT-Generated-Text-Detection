A lot of people post high quality and really interesting self posts and I feel they should be recognized for that. I frequent two subreddits that revolve a lot around self posts. These subs being rEminem and rDadjokes. As long as there's an upvotedownvote system applied to the selfposts I think karma should be awarded like it would be if someone had a good comment or a funny remark. On the opposite end of the spectrum, downvotes would subtract karma. Obviously these posts aren't links but in my opinion, comment karma would be appropriate.
