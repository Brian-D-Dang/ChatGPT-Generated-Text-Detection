I believe that a person can only be male or female and can only be heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual. I also believe that if a person wants to change genders or believes that they were born into the wrong gender then they have the right to do so. I've recently heard of Facebook allowing over 30 possible gender options and I think that doesn't make any sense what so ever. How can people be anything other than male or female? I don't know if I'm the only sane person in a world filling with perverts andor young people confused with their own sexuality and want to make us go out of our way to change our existing ideas of sexuality just so they can feel happy or just a bigot unaware of some sort of change. try to CMV please.
