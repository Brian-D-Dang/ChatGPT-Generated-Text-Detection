SMTP is used to actually pass on emails from a mail client to a mail server, or between different mail servers. It's basically the postal service for email. POP3 is a basic protocol to download emails from your mailbox. It is rather limited, in the sense that it can only be used to download mails (and delete them from the inbox once downloaded - this is optional). A major disadvantage of this limitation is that your mail client cannot inform the mailbox if you have read an email, or marked it back as unread, or flagged it, etc. These things are purely maintained client-side. This is not ideal if you share a single mailbox with multiple users and you want your changes and mail status to be reflected to all users. POP3 can be seen as the PO Box for email. IMAP is more powerful, in the sense that is does not have the limitations outlined above. The status of emails is kept server-side (readunread, flags, priority, etc.) and even moving email to another folder (or even to another mailbox on another server) will be reflected server-side. These changes are thus visible to all users that connect to that mailbox. Generally speaking, a principle of IMAP is that emails always remain on the server (until archived explicitly), while with POP3 emails are deleted from the server once downloaded (unless the mail client is explicitly instructed not to delete them). For end users, IMAP is usually the best way to interact with your mailbox. For computers systems that want to exchange datamessages with each other, POP3 is still sometimes used (though it would be considered a legacy protocol for this purpose).,SMTP is for sending email. POP3 downloads recieved emails to your computer, generally not leaving them on the server. IMAP leaves the emails on the server, and just makes them locally accessable.
