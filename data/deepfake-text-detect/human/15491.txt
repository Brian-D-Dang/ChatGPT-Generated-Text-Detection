Oh Chu Chai. You have always been so good to me. Since I was studying at McGill in 1998 to my most recent visit a few weeks ago. You always leave me licking my lips and wishing I was back in Montreal. And again, you left another carnivorous friend in shock by your faux meat. I have eaten a lot of faux meat and I usually am not very impressed. But chu chai does something very special and unique with theirs. If you have been disappointed by faux meat in the past, give this place a try before you shun it forever. During the last visit, we ordered the duck which was Incredible. 1010 Be sure to order this when you head there! My friend said the duck was better than any Real duck she had had! We also order the basil chicken which was fantastic as always and the pad thai. Oh and the dumplings were fantastic! This place is one of the reasons why I crave visits to Montreal.
