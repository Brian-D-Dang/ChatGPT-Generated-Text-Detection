I don't mean people who were ACTUALLY raped, but those who know that that person in no way shape or form ever raped them, but accuse them of doing so. If that person goes to the police, and lie and claim some dude raped her, knowing he didn't, and somehow that guy gets convicted, there is a part of me that thinks he should break away from the police, and rape her. So that when he goes to jail, he would have actually done the thing he was convicted for. Rationally I know this is wrong, and kind of twisted, so cmv. EDIT: clairebones has pointed out that doing something like this would make it worse, take away any comfort the falsely accused has (comfort that he is innocent) and take away any chance at appeal.
