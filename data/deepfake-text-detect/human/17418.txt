Not trying to start a flame war or anything here, but this is what I truly believe. It truly boggles my mind how a large chunk of society can feel that the woman is not at fault AT ALL if she willingly chooses to knowingly put herself in a situation where something like that happening has a high chance of doing so. It's the equivalent of dressing like you come from wealth then walking through the slums of the city. If you get robbed, it's due to your own stupidity. The same goes for not putting a car alarm on your car and then complaining it got stolen. Of course those who commit such crimes should be punished, but I believe they should be punished less harshly, because it makes committing a crime of opportunity so much easier to happen. Raising crime rates, so to speak. But how does punishing criminals less harshly reduce crime rates? I believe it's more about punishing the individual to wisen up and take precautions, and it would send a message to society in general. Anyway, back on topic. It isn't hard to refrain from drinking, have a friend come with you, dress appropriately or take a taxi home for such things. In this case, yes, she would have deserved it. I haven't heard any good arguments against this before, so please, CMV. Edit: I would like to clarify I am not saying AT ALL that in different circumstances that victims deserved the rape. I am aware that the majority of rapes happen by someone they know, but this thread is not to discuss that circumstance. In that circumstance the rape is not deserved. Edit 2: Thanks for uRaider17 for changing my view by providing studies that state there is no correlation between the way a woman dresses and her likelihood of getting raped. I incorrectly assumed that the way a woman dresses impacts her chances of getting raped.
