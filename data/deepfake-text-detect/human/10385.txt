I really like Coke (hell look at my username), like really. I made the trek to Atlanta about a year ago for the sole reason of visiting the Coca-Cola Museum. So when yesterday came by and one of my friend put a Pepsi in my fridge, my choice was to throw it away. But I didn't for.... some reason..... And now I have a Pepsi in my fridge. I don't like Pepsi, and I never will. I haven't drunk Pepsi for 2 years about this point, and now I ask reddit to try and find a way to get me to drink the sweat of Gary, Indiana.
