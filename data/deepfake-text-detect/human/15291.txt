New restaurant, the food was not bad. There was no one there but our table when we went, I believe that is because they are located in a business district and most customers come in for weekday lunch (we went for dinner). Our server is nicer and more attentive than most other servers I've had. Just for the friendly service I would recommend people giving this place a try, plus the food is pretty decent.
