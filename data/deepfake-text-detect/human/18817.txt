I was reading a thread on the frontpage about how in America, the public vote counts for next to nothing. First reply after the top comment is about net neutrality. I don't believe anyone between the ages of 1 and 30 is against net neutrality, which leads to my conclusion. Older people should not be permitted to influence public policy on subjects that they do not understand because they have become too distanced from the current culture and technology. I could reference other cases of older generations giving the youth the shaft, intentionally or not (police bargaining to a new contract that retroactively increases their pay but decreases the pay of all incoming officers, social security...).
