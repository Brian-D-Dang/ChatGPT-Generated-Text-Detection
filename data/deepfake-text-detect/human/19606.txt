Reference Article: I don't buy into the idea that the president should never play golf or relax in any way. That seems to be an absurd and hypocritical standard that the right wing media seems to enjoy holding when it's convenient. That said I think it's politically and morally tone deaf for a President to have a press conference about the very public and gruesome beheading of an American Journalist and then go directly to the golf course. I also think because of Reddit's left leaning bias if this had happened with a Republican in the White House this kind of story would be on the front page, or at least on the front of rpolitics. I would be open to someone CMV about this, but it seems to me Reddit is missing out on potentially valid newscurrent events when they wear negativity blinders when it comes to people that represent their ideological beliefs.
