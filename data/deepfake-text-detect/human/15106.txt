it's been a while since I've discovered Ma Cha (and this was solely bc they sell David Bacco macha chocolates herewhich are my FAVORITE DB chocolates everrr. Yes, somehow everything in my life relates back to David Bacco). Since my discovery, I always mean to go study at Ma Cha but I never seem to remember this place.... or I just opt for a coffeehouse. Granted, my love for black, black coffee knows no bounds. But.... I also really love tea. And I love this teahouse. And they have a NINJA as their mascot. Who doesn't love ninjas? Someone who is not fun. Clearly. BUT NOW I JUST FOUND OUT THEY MAKE CUPCAKES. SHUT UP. My mind BLOWN Henceforth, I will commence my loyal (and constant) patronage of Ma Cha until I move away (T minus 2.5 months!). I realize my discovery of the cupcakes is slow but.... I've never been very quick on.... well, anything. lol.
