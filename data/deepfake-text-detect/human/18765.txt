I got the idea from the plagiarism post, because, while I'm against plagiarism, I don't think the citation methods like MLA or APA or whatever are necessary. IMO a name, title, and year of publication are all that really matter. What's the point of including things like the journal it was published in or whatever. I get that it helps to accurate show where the work was originally published but I don't believe they should be included when simpler things like previously mentioned should be fine to accurately give the person credit. edit: I probably should've been a little more specific. I'm fine with including what journal it came from in addition to the stuff I already mentioned. But I don't see where a lot of the other stuff should come in and why it also has to be organized in the manner it is. I'm sure there's an easier way.
