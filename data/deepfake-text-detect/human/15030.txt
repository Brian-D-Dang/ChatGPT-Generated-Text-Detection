Kung Fu has one of the best lunch specials in Vegas. For 5.95 you get soup, an entree with steamed or fried rice, an egg roll and a fried chicken wing from 11-3pm. The rest of the menu is very exhaustive including Thai and Chinese dishes. The hot pots of soup are intense and delicious, better for parties of 3 or more. The food is rich and flavorful and none of the staff speaks much English, which means the cook are Thai and know what they're doing. In an effort to not sound offensive, if you want people to speak perfect English get some generic food from Panda Express.
