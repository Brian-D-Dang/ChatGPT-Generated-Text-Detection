First, I want to address the more specific contention about mandating sociology in college. I believe that sociology has very few people taking it as a major (relatively speaking) and it only subsists as a separate subject because so many people studying other areas are required to take it or need to in order to fulfill an elective requirement. While I am very supportive of opening student's minds to other subject matters than their specific majors, I feel that sociology is a subject that revolves too much around common sense and knowledge that could be concluded by an intelligent individual after a little thought. This moves me to the broader topic, that sociology is useless in general. As I stated, it is mostly common sense. Why do poor people remain poor? Sociology claims that it could be a cycle of poverty, a flaw in the societal system, or biological issues with the victims themselves. All of the contentions seem like rather obvious conclusions. Would most people really need a lengthy book, a teacher, and quizzes and tests to come to these points? I say no. However, I do see one advantage with sociology. This is that sociology can give good statistical analyses of group demographics and attitudes within populations of countries and certain groups. But I don't believe that this one function merits sociology enough credit to classify it as its own important subject field. I see it more as a specialization of statisticians or maybe a lesser topic to be regarded when studying history or political studies. And again, my main point is that the field is so basic and intuitively obvious to the common person that it should not really be taught as its own separate subject. CMV.
