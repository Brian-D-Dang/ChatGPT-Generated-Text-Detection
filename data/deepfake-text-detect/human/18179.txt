What I'm talking about is what you would call a 'punk' or 'chav' in the UK- the people who belong to this culture often criticize caution, introspection, and sensitivity and glorify hedonism and base pleasures. Rap, house, reggae, and hip hop are the genres of music that these people most often listen to. A higher percent of latinos, and especially blacks, tend to belong to this culture, but recently a very large percent of young whites have adopted this as well. The people who belong to this culture tend to not care about achieving self actualization- they seem to care about money and sex and drugs. They can't see why somebody should care about education, or things outside of their narrow view of the world. They are unorganized and apathetic towards politics. I don't think this is a class based thing- I see lots of middle class white kids adopt this culture. And other impoverished, lower class cultures seem to have been able to produce art and organize to help themselves. I don't know. By the way, I don't mean to say that there is no artistic value in rap, I know there is some good rap, but I can't think of a better way to identify the type of people I'm talking about. CMV.
