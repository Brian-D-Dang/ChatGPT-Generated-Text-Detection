The theme of this paper is three-phase distribution system modeling suitable for the Z-Bus load-flow. Detailed models of wye and delta constant-power, constant-current, and constant-impedance loads are presented. Models of transmission lines, step-voltage regulators, and transformers that build the bus admittance matrix (Y-Bus) are laid out. The Z-Bus load-flow is then reviewed and the singularity of the Y-Bus in case of certain transformer connections is rigorously discussed. Based on realistic assumptions and conventional modifications, the invertibility of the Y-Bus is proved. Last but not least, MATLAB scripts that model the components of the IEEE 37-bus, the IEEE 123-bus, the 8500-node feeders, and the European 906-bus low-voltage feeder are provided.
