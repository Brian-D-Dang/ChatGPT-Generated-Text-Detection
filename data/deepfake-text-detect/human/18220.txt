I see a lot of backlash for Fifty Shade's depiction of an "unhealthy" BDSM relationship, but I don't understand why people make such a big deal out of it. Let's be perfectly honest, people watch a ton of porn where a boss forces his employees to give him sex, incest, "inappropriate BDSM" and all sorts of things that are incorrect in the real world. Why is Fifty Shades held to a different standard? I believe that the true backlash for this movie is because people don't like the idea of middle-aged women going to see a naughty movie. I honestly believe that this is healthy for Americans to see, to be more open about sex and their sexual fantasies. Because, in the end, Fifty Shades isn't an instruction booklet, it's an appeal to the naughty dreams of American women. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
