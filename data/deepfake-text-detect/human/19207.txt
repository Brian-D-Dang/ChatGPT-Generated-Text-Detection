I am an American, but I don't see why Americans in general seem to be so against other countries growing in size and power. What is the problem if we are one of a dozen powerful countries in the world, but no longer the most powerful one? There are many smaller countries on Earth that enjoy a much higher quality of life than the US, like Switzerland, Australia, and some Scandinavian countries, among others. If we were no longer a superpower, we would not have to spend billions of dollars being be the policeman for other countries and trying (and often failing) to spread democracy elsewhere. We could then keep more focus on our own internal affairs, and spend that money on our own citizens where it's needed. Such as on education, healthcare, innovation, etc. Please let me know if I'm missing out on some important aspect of the situation that I hadn't previously thought of. Hello, users of CMV!
