Not Avatar: The Last Air Bender, Jame's Cameron's Avatar. Sure, the CGI and graphics were great. However, the plot behind the story was extremely simplistic, and could essentially be described as Pocahontas In Space. It was extremely predictable, with cliche themes and names (unubtanium?). While it could have been a great world to explore, much of the cooler aspects of two totally different species meeting seems to be left out. I don't think it really adds any value to the Sci-Fi genre. Change my view.
