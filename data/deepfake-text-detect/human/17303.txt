OK so i was trying to argue with my SJW teacher (proably my first mistake) that places like little china or other communities arent being made by white men to keep the minorities down but are a natural occurrence when people come to another country. My argument hinges on the fact that people will naturally search out things that are familiar to them especially if they are moving halfway around the world. So by going and living near others from where you live you can be in a community that is going though the same thing you are and have the same back ground and can help you get adjusted to the new country. And white, black, asaian, you see little italy, ireland, mexico, etc in alot of cities were people new to the country come to live. So finaly i say that its a natural part of the migration of peoples, they come from their country, seek out people and things familiar to them, acclimate to the new country, then they or their children move out of "little whatever" and into more mixed neighboorhoods.
