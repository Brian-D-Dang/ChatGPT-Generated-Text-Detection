I've been thinking about punishment theories, but I cannot think of a fair way in which to punish a victimless crime more than a non-victimless crime. Yet there are several victimless acts where the punishment can be either decades in jail or exorbitant fines, which seems very excessive and pointless to me. An act which does not negatively affect another person is inherently less harmful than an act that does negatively affect another person. Not sure if I can explain this any further, so I'll just list some examples of victimless crimes: Sodomy - probably the easiest example to agree with. Sodomy is the "crime" of unnatural sex acts, and is largely synonymous with homosexual sex as far as relevance goes. While legal today, historically the punishment for sodomy has been DEATH. In many parts of the world this is still the case, and even in America, Sodomy was punishable by death (but usually long imprisonment or hard labor). Ironically enough Russia was the first nation to officially legalize homosexuality about 100 years ago. Drug possession - sentences vary from state to state, but due to mandatory minimum sentencing laws many end up serving over 10 years for possession of "hard" drugs like crack or heroin. You could argue that having enough to distribute makes someone harmful to society, but just enough for personal use? Piracy - punishment for this is rare, but when it gets punished, the punishment is incredibly oppressive. A [220,000 fine for downloading 24 songs] serves absolutely no purpose and is downright cruel. Even something like "pay 10x the price of these songs" would be fine in comparison. I'm wondering how this stuff even makes sense from a legal perspective, and I can think of no punishment theories that would justify such punishment. They go overboard from the perspectives of rehabilitation, deterrence and certainly retribution.
