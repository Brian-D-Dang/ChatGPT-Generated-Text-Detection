Basically, both of them have similar objectives, similar implementation, and similar results. Both Chemical and conventional weapons are intended to be used to kill people. Both of them can be used to achieve similar total death tolls. Why is it worse for people to have been gassed to death than for them to die slowly with shrapnel stuck in their gut? This also relates to international intervention. If we don't distinguish between the two types of warfare then there won't be international outcry over chemical warfare anymore, but rather on warfare as a whole, which could work to eliminate a negative stigma associated with this issue and could then lead to countries intervening more often in cases of domestic violence. On an effect-level basis, both the types of warfare are similar once again. The usage of either types of weaponry will end in the death of people. Realizing this to be a necessary side-effect of warfare, how can we judge that the usage of chemical weapons will cause more painagony than conventional warfare when even bullets and shrapnel can lead to horrible situations like perforated lungs? Since we can't, it doesn't make much sense to draw a line between them. Drawing this line also seems to make conventional warfare look better than it is. One important realization which this makes us overlook is that all warfare is inherently harmful. By setting these levels of prioritization we're essentially making chemical weapons a bigger deal, and to some degree we're justifying the usage of "accepted," or conventional warfare, which I believe to be morally flawed considering the basis for that argument. Well guys, CMV.
