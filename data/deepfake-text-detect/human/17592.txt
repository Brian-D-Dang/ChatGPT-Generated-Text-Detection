It seems to me that even Atheists, though I lean more towards them, are arrogant in their supposed proof that God doesn't exist. So are Christians. Because in saying 'yes' and 'no' you're assuming you have knowledge on a subject that, from what I know, is impossible to come to a conclusion on. This isn't just Christians by the way- this all people who believe in god. Now, I can see where both sides come from. The idea of a Christian God is sometimes flat out ridiculous. But so is the claim that someone knows that in an incomprehensibly large universe, throughout infinite amount of time, there wasn't anything that had a part in creating it? Also somewhat self centered to assume you have an idea. TL:DR- I think the only appropriate response to if you believe in God or religion is 'I don't know' because as humans it's all speculation. Both sides have points, but to be so firm in your beliefs makes you arrogant, as you assume you know something that is impossible to know.
