Inspiration The endless hunt begins as all life does: A single breath - The first of many - A seedling hatched, Free to grow And expand the tree of knowledge One branch at a time, veiled By elder leaves. A solitary bud as winters come and go; It requires more than time For ideas to take root. Men live and die without seeing bloom. My eyes have long watched this mental knot, Wooden is my resolve to witness - Not mere limb Nor countless empty pages added to the living tome - It's nourishment: inspiration. A breeze, quaking dusty foliage The brilliant rays pour through And are quickly blocked As the leaves are free to settle. The momentary sustenance, A crack in the crowded growth, Comes but once, If at all. In that moment, (Not enough for a word to form Or a heart to beat - A life to start) A new sheet An extension of everything we know.
