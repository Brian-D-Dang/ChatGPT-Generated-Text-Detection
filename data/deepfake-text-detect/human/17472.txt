One of the tenets of Marxism is that the proletariat are the oppressed class and that the bourgeoisie are the oppressor class. There are events that support this theory, such as a [child rapist from the Du Pont family receiving no jail time] . However, whether or not you believe in Marxism is immaterial, as what I believe is that Patriarchy Theory is strictly less believable than Marxism. The cornerstone of Patriarchy Theory is that women are the oppressed class and men are the oppressor class. These are some of the reasons why I think it is less believable: It's an obvious ripoff of Marxism, which came about 100 years earlier. Obviously, not all men are capable of oppressing all women (unless you count sitting with your legs wide open as oppression). For example, a suburban upper middle class white girl lives one of the easiest lives anyone can live. However, all rich people are capable of oppressing all poor people. One needs to look no farther than Gina Rinehart and the Koch brothers to see examples of rich people oppressing poor people. Overall, I believe that Patriarchy Theory is strictly less plausible than Marxism. On the other hand, if you believe that this is a mainstream, orthodox view, feel free to send me a PM to that effect. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
