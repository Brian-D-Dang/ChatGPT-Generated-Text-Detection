I have seen charts [like this one] in blog posts and in discussions on reddit. I have always thought that the gains in income as a result of productivity increases are captured by those who create the productivity enhancement. An example at the micro level: Consider a company building cars from 1980 - 2000. Assume there is always demand for any number of units the company can produce, and that the company has a great brand and keeps the price the same, even if they make fewer cars. If in year 1980 a worker doing steel stamping is able to produce 100 cars per day, and the same worker doing steel stamping in 2000 is able to produce 200 cars per day as a result of his upgraded equipment, then should his real wage double? My answer is that (assuming the same labor dynamics - his job has not gotten more or less competitive) no, it shouldn't. The company invested a large amount into the mechanical upgrades, meaning that the creator of the productivity-enhancing upgrades received a large share of the incremental profit. The company probably paid up front for the machine and is now collecting the incremental profit to recoup the costs of the investment and then some. Can anyone point out where my thought process goes wrong? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
