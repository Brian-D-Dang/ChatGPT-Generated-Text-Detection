It seems to me that our legal system is built on a capitalistic model. If a lawyer is really good with a proven track record they can charge more money than other lawyers who don't have such a good record. This seems to indicate to me that the people who can hire these more expensive lawyers are increasing their odds that they will have a more favorable outcome of any litigation. Say someone is being sued by someone else who has a lot of money and they hire a lawyer who has won 95 of his cases and with the first person who can't afford such a high caliber lawyer, wouldn't the odds be slightly in favor of the more seasoned lawyer with a proven track record? I would like to not believe this, so please help me change my view. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
