There is no reason (except for some rare medical reasons) not to get the flu-shot. Anyone who doesn't is either a selfish prick or completely misinformed. I'm even willing to grant those who 'once had a bad reaction' to a flu-shot to avoid it. Odds are it was coincidental or psychosomatic, but I'll give the benefit of the doubt, in those instances. I have a bit of sympathy for those who have needle phobias. I still think it's a bit selfish and dumb, but I'm less harsh on them. However, anyone who says "I haven't got one and I never got the flu" is like saying, "I don't wear my seatbelt, and I never got into an accident." It's dumb. Others might give the excuse that they got the flu from the flu shot. NO YOU DID NOT. Further, even if you don't get the symptoms of the flu, you likely carry it, and pass it on to those that might not be able to, and may even die - thus you are responsible for a murder.
