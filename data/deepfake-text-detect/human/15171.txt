Stations (casino chain) replaced the Metro Pizza at Boulder Station with (what I believe to be) their own pizza chain called Slices. We avoided it for quite awhile; we finally gave it a try and wished we'd continued to avoid it. We ordered what I consider to be a 2-topping pizza consisting of mushrooms (all over), half pepperoni and half sausage. We were immediately informed that this is a 3-topping pizza and would be charged accordingly. I have never heard of this - is this the new norm? It's always been my experience that two half toppings count as one for pricing. How was the finished product? The crust is extremely thin, soggy and lacking flavor; I am usually one to eat the crust edges, but this was so bland, there was no point. The cheese is exceptionally greasy and it didn't go to the edge of the pie. The mushrooms were sparse and carelessly strewn about; however, there was a fair amount of both the pepperoni and sausage. And oregano? It was treated more like a topping than a spice! Why is it many pizza joints think that good pizza should consist of large amounts of oregano? Oregano should enhance the flavor, not BE the flavor! Now, I have a high tolerance for crappy pizza; this pizza was horrible, in my opinion, and being charged for 3 toppings really turned me off. What can I say that was good? The pizza wasn't outrageously priced (compared to other pizza places), it was ready fairly quickly, and they have good quality napkins.
