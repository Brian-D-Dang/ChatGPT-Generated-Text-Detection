I was soooo confused about this, too! But I think I have it figured out. It appears that the revenue comes from upped tobacco taxes and reduced tax credit eligibility and a couple other little measures. The SAVE measure is an accounting trick that "offsets" these tax increases. The students have a new fee (not counted as a tax increase by Grover's pledge) but it's offset with the tax credit (which the Grover people can count as a revenue reduction). So Jindal is counting this tax credit as offsetting his tobacco etc. tax increases I mentioned before. So in reality it doesn't literally offset the revenue because it's offsetting student fees that don't really exist. But he can still say "I raised taxes X million, but offset them with a tax credit also of X million!" It's a sleight of hand.
