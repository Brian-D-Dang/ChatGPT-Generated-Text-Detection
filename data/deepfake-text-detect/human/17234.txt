I'm not sure why, but I completely feel that if you made plenty of money doing the shittiest job on earth, you should be content. Example, if I made 100k a year from a job that I am not necessarily content with, I would prefer that over a job where I make 60-70k a year and enjoyed the 8 hour day. I feel this way because in my opinion, if you made good money with a job that (for you) has low job satisfaction, the time you have off will be even better because you have the money to be able to afford and do whatever you wanted, versus being happier with your job but not having the things you want in life. I feel I'm at a serious turning point in my life, and I want to make sure I look at all angles of opportunities presented to me. Please CMV!
