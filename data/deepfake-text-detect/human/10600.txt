My own understanding is basically that of a 5-year-old's, but I'd like to express as well: The baby boomers were raised post-War, in America's golden age. Everything good was on the rise. Their parents sacrificed, and they reaped the benefits. Jobs and stuff. The generation after, Gen X had a similarly good time because the effect of deregulation in the 70s is really only screwing us now. I mean damn, being of working-age in the 90s was pretty sweet. So my peers, children of the youngest boomers and oldest Gen Xers, are frequently accused of not pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps in these hard economic times, because our parents and grandparents don't understand that College Degree no longer equals Middle Class Job. Maybe that's too simple. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.," "There are a lot of them, and they're about to start retiring soon. All of them. That means a lot of people on benefits, in hospitals, and generally being a drain on the economy instead of contributing to it. On a more soft level, it's because there are a lot of them, and thus a voting power. Older people usually have different priorities than younger people and will vote to reflect that.
