One of the major problems with pharmaceutical research is that the incentives are not set up for accuracy, but for trying to prove particular hypotheses correct. This isn't a fix for the incentive problems, but reducing the potential for p-hacking, and having the data available for validation, is a significant step towards increasing the accuracy of these studies, improving patient welfare. The cost of performing these studies would be no different than that of differing studies, and would also highlight potential publication bias. Basically, I think this is an easy step to take in enhancing the quality of healthcare research, and should be taken urgently. CMV. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
