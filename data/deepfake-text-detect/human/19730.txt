I don't think anyone can stay as rich as the United States for forever. What we are seeing now in the United States; inflated cost of education for less return, higher unemployment, and a rise in class inequality, is just the natural slowing down of what has been a boom economy for a long time. That doesn't mean the United States is doomedwe'll just need to adjust to have a little less than we're used to and living in an economy that's grows a hell of lot more slowly than it did in the past. We will still enjoy relatively high standards of living, but future generations won't have as much as previous generations did. For example, the middle class norm seems to be shifting towards renting instead of owning property. A slow or no growth United States economy, combined with slightly lower standards of living, is not something to be afraid of, political rhetoric to the contrary. The U.S. economy couldn't grow forever, and it's healthy for the world for someone else to step up and experience really high standards of living and high growth for a while. We don't have to have the richest economy on the planet to live healthy, full lives.
