It should no longer exist because it only stifles perfectly good communication. If you argue it's used to get rid of bad comments that is weak because the only thing that should be removed is inappropriate or illegal things. The voting is subject to mob rule meaning it can result as either extremely negative or positive, with only the negative having a bad outcome. You can't really abuse the up voting. People either like it or they don't and if they don't they should just move on. It stifles opinions on a place that is supposed to be very open. Maybe I'm just venting for it continually happening right now but I am tired of giving perfectly good opinions or comments and looking up to see a -6. This is even one of the main rules for CMV, it should apply to all of reddit. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things. Firstly, please remember to [read through our rules] . If you see a comment that has broken one, it is more effective to report it than downvote it. Speaking of which, [downvotes don't change views] ! If you are thinking about submitting a CMV yourself, please have a look through our [popular topics wiki] first. Any questions or concerns? Feel free to [message us] . Happy CMVing!
