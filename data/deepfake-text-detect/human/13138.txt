It's funny how to people it can look like you have everything, when you obviously have nothing. Everyone is looking to fill that void. Careers, relationships, whatever, we all want to fill it; you've heard the story I'm sure. Well it's impossible to fill, because we've lost ourselves. I had money, we all know deep down that it doesn't bring happiness. I had the love of millions of strangers, not everybody realizes how meaningless this is because so many of us are always trying to win over others because deep down we have problems with ourselves. The truth is, when you have everything that everybody else thinks they want, you realize how hopeless it truly is. All I want was that feeling I had when I was a kid, to truly trust somebody with all my soul, to have no inhibitions and to connect with someone for real. I'm afraid that in this world we are all alone, and on top of that we don't even really have ourselves.
