(I'm about to go to work, so I won't be able to answer for a few hours.) I don't think driving under the influence of a substance should incur greater legal charges than other traffic crimes (though on a related note I think reckless driving should be more frequently addressed and punished to a greater degree). A person who is driving under the influence is unnoticeable as doing such until they begin making traffic violations such as driving well below the speed limit or swerving into other lanes. These actions are already illegal, and should simply be punished as is. At most, the police officer should be able to say that a person is not in a state to continue driving based on an inability to form coherent sentences or to maintain a vertical position, abs should be able to impound the car or otherwise force the driver to reach his destination in another manner. This ability should be afforded in any instance where a police officer believes the person cannot drive, not just in cases of obvious intoxication. Because these actions are not punished as is, the only thing that makes driving under the influence extra illegal is the contents of the driver's blood I think it is a violation of a person's rights to criminalize the contents of their blood instead of their actions, and to tie an extra offense to the same action based on the contents of the blood is an example of that violation.
