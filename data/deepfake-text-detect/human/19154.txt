I live in Israel and at least in the area that I live (WB, I am not here to debate that though) after many terror attacks at schools many teachers started carrying handguns, this for example stopped the [Mercaz HaRav massacre] and could have stopped the [Ma'alot massacre] . This practice could help stop many school shootings around the world. Schools can pay for the purchase of the weapons and pay for the shooting courses and basic security measures (safes). I do not see any reason not to allow teachers to defend students if the need arises. This can also help teachers defend themselves against violent studentsparaents. CMV
