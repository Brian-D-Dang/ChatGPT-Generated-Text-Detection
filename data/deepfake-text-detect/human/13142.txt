At the very peak of all possible cruelty is to take a man's life from him and to leave him alive. To make his life your own out of some twisted sense of importance, out of amusement, greed. Cave walls, dolomites in their skulls, we came in as explorers. Explorers, though, have been known to take things further than intended - chipped down, rotted out, brightened and fragmented the innards - what we left was merely the shell. As it turns out, once you're in there you can change the man outside - raise the arm, spill his drink. Make him speak with your voice, mumbling about sin, about murder - you know, harmless pranks. Just like a drone strike, I guess - if you're not really there, neither are the feelings. They stare into the dumb oaf's eyes and blame him for what you do. Rewarded with total impunity to act as you please terrifying to think that in such a hideous act, one would find the meaning of life. And as I left, I felt changed somehow. Both more human than I ever had been, and more demonic. It occurred to me that I no longer knew the difference. It occurred to me that I do not know which I started as.
