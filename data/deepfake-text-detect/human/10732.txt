Well, it's really "religious intolerance," but that's a lot longer than "racism." Not only that, but in the example of Muslims, people tend to have a specific face they envision while they're hating on the religion: a face that is brown and might wear a turban. Which results in anti- Muslim motivated attacks on Sikhs, for example. So the result is that people get to be racist under the guise of religious intolerance, which they justify with the actions of a miniscule percentage of said religion.','Actually, Judaism is not only a religion but a "race" as well. Jews are an ethnoreligious group - an ethnic group that shares a religion. People who hate Jews don't hate the religion, they hate the people.
