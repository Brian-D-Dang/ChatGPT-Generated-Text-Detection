I believe that when someone likes a game enough to play it, but not enough to pay for it, they are necessarily acting on an assumption that they are entitled to play that game. There is no way this could be true, because games are not a basic necessity. Thus, such attitude is immoral and cannot justify taking profit away from developers or publishers. I can't believe anyone in their right mind would disagree, yet when I say something like this on Reddit, I always get downvoted, so clearly there must be something I'm missing here.
