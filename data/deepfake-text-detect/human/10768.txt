Its more of a clarity of view. As heavy precipitation moves through the atmosphere, it helps to dampen the local environment's particulates that are kicked up through normal daily activites. Smog, dust, smoke, water vapors and other gasses that obstruct your view of the sky are repressed and pushed back to earth, either physically by being hit or trapped in watericesnow as it falls to the earth, or by being blown and dispersed by the change in pressure and winds moving the particles away. Either way, the result is moreso in the winter when generally light is going to be hitting your hemisphere at a significant angle, by removing particulates in the air, the light isn't refracted as much or as severely as it had been, and it allows the light to get to its destination much easier. So the rains help clear in the winter as much as the summer, however its more noticable in the winter.
