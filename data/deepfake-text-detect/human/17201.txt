My argument is not that slavery was good for slaves, or that it improved the African by exposing him to the white man, or that they needed discipline or anything absurd or racist like that. It's simply this: Look at the quality of life of your average African American, and compare it to the quality of life of your average West African. It's not even close, African Americans, as bum a rap as they get in a lot of ways in the US, are way better off than their African cousins. Life expectancy is longer, income is higher, there's better access to food, water, shelter, even for the poorest African Americans. There's basically no metric by which Africans are better off than blacks in the US. It's not as though, if not for the slave trade, Africa would be in great shape. Sure, it might be a little better, but there still would've been hundreds of years of colonialism stamping it down. Would 12 million additional people (the number kidnapped and brought over here) really have made that much of a difference in the long run? Would anywhere in West Africa be a place that, after living in the West, you'd want to go raise a daughter? The 40 million or so blacks in America are the 1. In exchange for a couple hundred years of utterly brutal, vicious slavery in the United States, they're so much better off than their African counterparts that I think that the only rational conclusion is that they're the real winners of the Atlantic slave trade. It was horrible, immoral, unjust by any rational standard, but it was a net win for them.
