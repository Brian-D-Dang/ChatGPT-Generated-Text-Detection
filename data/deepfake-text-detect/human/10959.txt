You can't. At least not with all magnets. Electro Magnets can be turned on and off because the magnetic field is achieved by an electrical current. When the power is on the field is created. When the power is off, the field collapse. Permanent magnets such as the kind you put on your refrigerator. Their field can be turned off by demagnetizing it, but then you can't turn it on unless you remagnetize it.
