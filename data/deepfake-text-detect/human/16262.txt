The Pilgrim Street building was refurbished between November 2006 and May 2008; during the refurbishment works, the cinema relocated to the Old Town Hall, Gateshead. In May 2008 the Tyneside Cinema reopened in the restored and refurbished original building. The site currently houses three cinemas, including the restored Classic - the United Kingdom's last surviving news cinema still in full-time operation - alongside two new screens, a roof extension containing the Tyneside Bar, and dedicated education and teaching suites.
