I have no beef with organized religion. I don't know what I believe quite yet, if anything at all. And I don't care if people believe in a deity. I think we are all entitled to believe in whatever religion we desire. At the same time, I see it as disgusting that some religions (mission trips) see people as desperate for a particular religion. I see mission trips to far off countries as having the sole purpose of spreading christianity or another religion. I agree, sometimes these trippers do some physical good, but at times they focus solely on spreading their religion. What gives them the right to see their beliefs as superior to another's beliefs? And what gives them the right to think they are completely allowed to displace another's religion? They are humans just like another, it seems they may be blinded by religion to see others as needing change. How can they see someone as so backwards, even in this day and age, that they need a specific religion? I recently wondered this after a friend's mission trip was sent to a native american reservation. Overall, I see it as pompous and self righteous to see your own religion as a basis for claiming that others may be inferior and in great need for change in such an aspect rather than adopting a "live and let live" type policy. I just see it as almost regarding another's religion as inferior and not suitable for practice to the point that certain groups should welcome another religion. As for me, I generally dislike those who see others as inferior to them; I just don't like people with a undeserved superiority complex. I suppose it strikes me wrong that a group practices a religion for thousands of years, and suddenly someone comes along and says "you're wrong, I'm right; follow this to find true righteousness or suffer some consequence." I could probably explain this better, but regardless please CMV.
