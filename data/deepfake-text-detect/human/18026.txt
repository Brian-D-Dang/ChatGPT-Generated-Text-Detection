Within many subreddits, especially worldnews and politics, the articles that present the unbiased facts end up getting buried while the hyperbolic articles always bubble to the top. as a redditor who wants understand the whole issue, I often find myself frustrated that it's nigh impossible to find a source for manymost of the claims made. for example, the "cia snooping on the senate" subject left me frustrated by both reddit and major news outlets since nobody linked to a source. they mention "in the unclassified report by..." but nobody links to the report. I'm no better informed after reading The Guardian article and reading the reddit comments than I was before; each creates their own echo-chamber for advancing a particular view, but nobody is giving sources or facts, which leads to a biased, and often wrong, understanding that wouldn't have existed before (counter productive). (as an side, is there a subreddit where I can reward people with reddit gold for finding me information?)
