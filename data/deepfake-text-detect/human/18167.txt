I'm generally a pretty good parker. Not great, but pretty good. I used to drive cars for a rental car company and got a lot of experience pulling in and out of parking spaces. However, I'm also blind in one eye, which means my depth perception isn't too hot. So I dealt with my fair share of bad parkers. Some genuinely just didn't give a fuck, but most seemed to be in a hurry or (as they were rental cars) unfamiliar with driving a large SUV or the like. I'm genuinely shocked to see the intense ire people have on Reddit and other sites for bad parking jobs. I think that posts like [this] or [this] or [this] are ego trips by their authors. Life happens. You have your turkey in the oven but you need to get more oil so you rush out the door and to the store and really don't care too much about how the car is parked. I realize I'm apologizing for selfishness, but I'd rather assume the best in people than walk around thinking everyone is asshole but me.
