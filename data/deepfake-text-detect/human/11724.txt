Apple's'Time Flies' event will be on September 15. While the event usually means the announcement of new iPhones, it is unlikely that new iPhones will be announced at the event as Apple has already said that new iPhones won't go on sale during the usual time this year. Several Apple Watch announcements are expected, including a Series 6 Watch, the launch of watchOS 7, and updates to the Series 5 and Series 3 watches. The iPad Air might get a redesign with an edge-to-edge screen, Touch ID on the power button, and a Smart Connector. The arrival of the new iPad could also mean that Apple intends to release iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 at the event. Apple has been working on a variety of different hardware projects, including headphones and AirTags, and also on a subscription bundle called Apple One.
