It's pretty well known that the internet does not agree. Political correctness is a pretty big bogeyman on reddit and the wider web, notably because it apparently contradicts ideals of free speech. It's true that certain elements on places like Tumblr take the principles so far that they become twisted and racist themselves, but I think that the basic principles - that you should try not to offend people - are perfectly good ones. Maybe bear in mind that your joke about rape could be upsetting to someone, or that 'OP is a fag' does actually insinuate that gay people are somehow lesser. That is not to say that you shouldn't be allowed to say those things, and any legislation that does try and make it actually illegal should be vigorously opposed. The way I see it is that it is no different from not swearing graphically in front of a mother and kids, or simply directly not insulting someone. Basically, don't be a dick. And if you want to be a dick, that's your prerogative. But it's certainly not a violation of your freedom if someone criticizes you for it, because free speech laws go both ways. But the way I see it is not the way most people see it, so I'm interested to see if anyone can convince me otherwise.
