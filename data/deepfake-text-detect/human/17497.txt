I'd like to refer to point seven of the [Nine Principles of Pollicing] attributed to Peel in the 19th Century when creating an "ethical police force": "7. (...) the police are the public and the public are the police; the police being only members of the public who are paid to give full-time attention to duties which are incumbent on every citizen in the interests of community welfare and existence" Thus, there is no legal distinction between a member of the police force and the public - as such the laws are enforced by the citizens of the democracy, rather than the institutions of the state. Any state which enforces its laws with police that are distinguishable in law from ordinary citizens, regardless of commitments to "partnerships with the community" is creating a distinction between citizen and state, something that is fundamentally in opposition to democracy. I would like to keep this debate within the confines of theory - responses along the lines of "but it doesn't turn out that way in practice" with no explanation of why it doesn't work in theory will not be enough to change my view. That said, supporting evidence from how the theory translates to practice would obviously add weight. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
