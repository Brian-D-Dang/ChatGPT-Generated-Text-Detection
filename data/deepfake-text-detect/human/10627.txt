Is this a serious question? Hourly is paid based on hours worked and salary is a set pay no matter how many hours worked.','Well, you can be employed and be payed an hourly wage, in which your work hours all count towards your paycheck. The more you work, the more you make. But...the less you work, the less you make. ORRRRR you can take a salaried position, which is a set amount no matter how much you work. In my experience, once they offer you a salary position, they no longer have to pay you overtime and will work you to fucking death!!
