Zomato has acquired the Indian operations of Uber Eats for around 350 million. The deal will give Uber about 10 percent shareholding in Zomato. Uber Eats customers will be redirected to Zomato, and it will cease to exist as a separate brand locally. The Uber Eats team will not be absorbed, and executives will either be reallocated to Uber's other divisions or laid off. Zomato is now expected to corner more than 50 percent of the Indian market. Uber Eats was the third biggest player in the market, behind Zomato and Swiggy. It was underperforming in the market, operating on losses throughout last year.
