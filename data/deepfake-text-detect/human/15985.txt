The capabilities approach - sometimes called the human development approach - looks at income inequality and poverty as form of "capability deprivation." Unlike neoliberalism, which "defines well-being as utility maximization," economic growth and income are considered a means to an end rather than the end itself. Its goal is to "wid[en] people's choices and the level of their achieved well-being" through increasing functionings (the things a person values doing), capabilities (the freedom to enjoy functionings) and agency (the ability to pursue valued goals).
