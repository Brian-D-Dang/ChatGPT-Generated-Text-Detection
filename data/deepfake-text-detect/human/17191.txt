I have seen a few posts where somebody has held the opposite view to this and I have never once seen a response to any argument so I figured I'd post my position and hope somebody can help me understand the other side. First, I am not saying that we should torture and kill animals just for pure sadistic pleasure, thats fucked up and stupid. However, I feel like just about 99.9 of Americans are exploiting animals for personal gain or unnecessary luxuries. Not to generalize, but often times many vegans have given me shit for eating meat. Saying things like the life of the animal that i am eating is far more important than me having a tasty meal. However, the person who is giving me shit lives in a house, drives a car, uses electricity, all activities that harm animals. Houses are made from wood, the production of which leads to deforestation which is bad for the animal kingdom. Driving a car uses gasoline which produces pollutants when they are created and used which kills animals. A decent percentage of electricity is created through coal which causes the death of animals through largely the same methods. So I value the life of animals less than the luxuries that they bring like sustenance and electricity. I wonder why a number of vegans feel like they do not abuse animals in any way when they hold the luxury to go on the internet and look at animals over the life of said animals. TL;DR Anybody reading this is responsible for the suffering and death of animals, those who live on the grid and give meat eaters shit for killing animals are giant hypocrites.
