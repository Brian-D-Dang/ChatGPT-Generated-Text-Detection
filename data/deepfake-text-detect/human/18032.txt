When we call someone "dead" because their heart stopped - or similar terms like "clinically dead" - we are using an outdated definition that is extremely misleading. The heart does not determine death, the brain does. The heart's only relation to life is to keep oxygen and waste products flowing to their respective organs. If the heart stops, the body begins starving of oxygen and waste products begin building up, leading to actual death. But there is some time after this happens before the person dies - not a lot, but saying that a person is dead the moment their heart stops is a lot like saying my cellphone is dead the moment I unplug it from the charger. Before we developed the ability to restart hearts, this moment was actually the beginning of death, but since that is no longer always true, we should stop referring to this state as "death." CMV
