Basically it bothers me that Americans seem to be more concerned with having everybody "fit in" than holding themselves up to a higher standard. Being overweight is not a disability. I believe that some mentally sound undisabled people are just plain stupid or lack the will power to put forth the effort to learn or better themselves. I believe American culture allows this to go on because our sense of acceptance is one of our founding principles but we take that notion to far. If someone could please change my view, i'd have more hope for my homeland. Tl;dr: americans should all be asian parents, no?
