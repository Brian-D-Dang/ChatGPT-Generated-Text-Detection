The Sykes-Picot Agreement put the current most troubled states in the Middle East under the sphere of influence and Mandate rule of the western powers of France and the U.K. after WWI. France and the U.K. had little care for the different ethnicities which occupied the region and grouped them together into makeshift countries with their enemies (such as the historical Sunni ruling over the majority Shia in Iraq). Also, the U.K. created Israel, which is of course the cause of a lot of debate and controversy. I feel without western influence, the Middle East would be a much more peaceful place today. CMV I was completely wrong, Britain did not create Israel and even abstained its vote for the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine during the U.N. General Assembly Resolution 181.
