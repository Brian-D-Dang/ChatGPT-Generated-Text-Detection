Hello lovely people of Youtube! It's time for another episode of DEATH DEFIER. Today, I'm jumping into a pool of acid. That will then be set on fire. And then exploded. [ Mimics exploding sounds ] Now, I've done each of these things separately in previous episodes, to see each of those again, click the links coming up on the screen - Whoop! There they are! - Or click the links in the description down below. But I haven't tried to combine them together until today and you guys will be the first to see it. Now, my crew has set up a special pool of highly dangerous, highly flammable acid. I'll be diving in head-first, no protective equipment whatsoever. Then, once I've been in there for a good minute or so, and I should have either drowned or had my flesh dissolved off, Bob up there will drop a torch from up high, as a safety precaution for my crew. Then, there are some mighty powerful explosives built in underneath the pool that are wired to remote detonate. Once you guys have watched all the carnage, my crew will dig me out of the rubble, and we'll see how I get put back together again. Alright guys, it's time to do it. And remember, DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME. I am a professional immortal, and a regular person doing any of this would only get seriously injured or killed. Don't forget to Like, Comment and Subscribe!
