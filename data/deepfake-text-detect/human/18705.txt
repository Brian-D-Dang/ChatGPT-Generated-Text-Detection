I'm citing this particular incident: Anthem Blue Cross is approved under Obamacare. I have no doubt that this attack is a direct result of the lack of foresight on passing the legislature. This particular indecent shows that Obamacare has provided a tool to organized crime in the form of Identity theft opportunities. Every major part of the industry that has backing from Obamacare is at higher risk to attack than before, because now there's likely to be a much larger incentive to cyber attack medical institutions. The long and short of my reasoning is that because everyone must now have health insurance, the coverage that provides the path of least resistance now has a massive boost in personal documentation. Essentially the government is funneling private information through healthcare services that likely don't have the best security credentials on the market. If people are required to submit their personal information as a consequence of being required to have health care, then the government should also have to ensure that, that information is as protected as any government institution is from hacking attempts, since the general public does not have a say in the matter.
