No, I'm not Romeo Rose. However, after all of the hubbub regarding his actions and beliefs, I felt that some of his views that received flak were similar to mine. I don't like the way overweight women (150 lb) or dark-skinned blacks in general look. There's something about the way blacks look that I simply don't like. Maybe the top 10 of lighter-skinned blacks would be okay, but I don't like their specific "color palette" in general. I'm fine with Indians. I don't think of blacks or the overweight as subhuman any more than I would think someone who I deemed ugly would be less of a person. It's just that I don't think I could ever be romantically involved with someone like that, but it's my sexual choice right? My parents were gay so I was raised to like what I like and not feel bad about it. But I'm reluctant to say this because I'm just a regular-looking yet scrawny 100-lb white male.

Statistically, 90 of blacks share the same racial features. Some overweight people don't look obese because of density or muscle structure. It's judging by external appearances either way, but people think that the weight criterion is okay? No one has been able to CMV so far so no deltas. Sorry: (
