I've had a couple kids, and while they are a bit younger, I don't think games are a vital role to their development. I had a bit of an argument with a friend about this, but we didn't really get anywhere. I have no issue with games in general, but I don't think they bring a lot to the table in terms of helping my children grow to be healthy adults. Hard work in school, at chores, and at a job seem to me to be the best ways for them to prepare for the real world. I think many games that exist today form unhealthy habits that really hurt my children more than they help. They don't teach hard work, many don't help their intelligence, and some can be very habit forming.
