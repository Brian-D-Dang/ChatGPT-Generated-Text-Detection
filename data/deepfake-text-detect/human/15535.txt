iSux! Ipower is the absolute poorest hosting company that I have ever had the misfortune of using. Still have one or two domains registered through them, but will transfer them away closer to expiring time. First of all, their customer service is pointless...the techs they have know less than you do most of the time. When you call, you will be on hold for hours and hours and still not get your issue resolved. Their Hosting is sketchy at best. If your site is up, it will load very slow, and move at a snail space no matter how simple your site is. I had a simple 3 page resume site up......it took no less than 45 seconds for the landing page to load. No Flash, No Photos, Very basic static site. These people suck. I had too many issues, most of which went unresolved, locked out of my account, slow sites, little to no real support, long azz hold times, crashing servers, no answers, double credit card charges, among just a few of my bad experiences. How about we try to find someone that has ever had a good experience with them?? Because such a person does not exist!:D
