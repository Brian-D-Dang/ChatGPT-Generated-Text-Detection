Most colleges do not require trigonometry for admissions, and do not require students to take a trigonometry course. It seems unfair that the SAT would include this in the math section. Some will argue that it makes sure students are "well rounded," but it's incredibly unfair to use this to test a student's aptitude for college. When I was in high school, I had an 89 overall GPA. I got mid-range scores on the reading and writing sections of the SAT, but did very poorly on the math section. Because of this, I was denied admission to many colleges which I applied to. I understand that my scores in reading and writing were average, but it was the low math score which really hurt my chances of admission. This might seem like a personal argument, but the fact remains that I'm sure many students would agree with me. I understand including algebra and geometry, but I don't see why they include trigonometry. This is a person's future which they are dealing with. EDIT: Of the five colleges I applied to, I was rejected by two of them, but was accepted by three of them. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
