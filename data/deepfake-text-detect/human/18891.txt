First, I want to say that I'm not related to any police officers. There are none in my family. With that being said, I have been taught all my life that if you play with fire, you get burned. Disobeying a cop is asking for trouble. Recently, there was [a lady who got shot at] during a traffic stop. Should the cops have fired? No. Was that woman incident? No. She TWICE pulled away from the cops. If she had not done that, there would have been no incident. AKA She Started It The cops didn't pull her over and say: Let's beat her up for no reason whatsoever. The classic example: Rodney King. Did he deserve to get beaten up? No. Was he "playing with fire"? Hell yes! He was driving drunk, speeding, and ran away from the cops. And yes, there are a few instances where the person literally did nothing wrong, but those are rare. Please don't simply list occurrences where the victim was truly innocent. I know they exist. TL;DR If you just obey the orders of the police, which 99 of the time are not unreasonable, you won't become a victim of police brutality. This victim mentality is stupid when they started this entire ordeal. Convince me otherwise. EDIT: Everyone keeps thinking I'm excusing bad cops' behavior. I do not think that at all. Brutality is terrible, but I just feel that it is very, very avoidable. EDIT 2: Wow! I did not expect this kind of heated argument. I have seen a few comments that might have change my mind, as well as some very rude ones. I'll read through them and give out a delta. Regardless, if I ever do get pulled over by the cops, I will be polite and obey them. I don't care what any of you say about that.
