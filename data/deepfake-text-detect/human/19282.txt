I believe this falls under reductionism and naturalism and determinism, but I might be wrong about those classifications. The consciousness is fully reducible to physical matter, and the evidence for this is overwhelming. Damaging specific parts of the brain affects consciousness is very predictable ways. We know what parts of the brain do what and we know which neurotransmitters and hormones do what. If we knew everything about every part of a car and its environment, we could predict whether it would accelerate, decelerate or remain at constant speed, or turn. If you made an identical copy of me and put us both in a sensory deprivation chamber, we would act in the exact same way. Disregard quantum randomness. CMV! Hello, users of CMV!
