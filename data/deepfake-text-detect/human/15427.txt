This is a must go place! I have been a regular at the Deer Valley location, and this lactation is just as good. Same great food, and same great people! This location has Moscow mules also! Excellent drink! I have never had a bad item from the menu! I typically get the fettuccine primavera or pollo marconi...been hooked on those ones for a while! Soooooo delicious! The lasagna is great, pasta emiliano, pasta giovanni, rigatoni alla laura...and so many more. You cannot go wrong. Great pizza, and you can order by the slice! Their breakfast is equally as good! Their French toast is my favorite! Save room for their breaded pudding...It is the absolute best! Times square is a must try. Both locations are great! Union Hills is a larger location, but still small and friendly! Come in and try it out! I guarantee you will not be disappointed!
