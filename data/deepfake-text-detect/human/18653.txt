Obviously I understand that reddit is an international community. However, nations exist. That is the reality, and idealizing our world as post-national is naive. Nations do not have friends, [they have interests.] Many of these new revelations needlessly embarrass our intelligence community and nation e.g. the tapping of Angela Merkel's phone. Why would Snowden leak such information when his stated intention is to curtail domestic surveillance increase transparency about domestic data collection? Apparently that is not his stated intention. That was the cause I stood behind. I saw him through rose colored glasses.
