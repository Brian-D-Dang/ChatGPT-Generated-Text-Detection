Seems like "positive" stereotypes are acceptable (Asians are smart, Jews are good with money, black people can dance) but negative stereotypes are pretty much taboo (Asians are bad drivers, Jews are stingy, black people don't tip well). If society is fine with the positive stereotypes, I think it should be fine with negative stereotypes as well. THAT DOESN'T MEAN someone should go out and be vocal about it, because that's just plain rude. But I think it's fine to have preconceived notions about races based on statisticsand, or personal observations.
