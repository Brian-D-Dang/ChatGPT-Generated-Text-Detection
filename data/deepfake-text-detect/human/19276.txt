As someone who is bisexual, I'm really curious as to how some people can still believe that homosexuality, bisexuality, or pansexuality is a choice. It just doesn't make any sense to me for a few reasons. Shouldn't their word be enough? Virtually no LGBP (Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Pan) individuals or organizations say it's a choice. If it wasn't a choice, wouldn't there at least be a vocal minority saying it is a choice, but still demanding rights and social accpetance on other grounds? Why would someone choose to be LGBP? People have been killed, beaten, disowned, fired, denied housing, and been oppressed and denied protection in other ways for their sexual orientation. Why would someone choose to be a part of an oppressed minority? If it was a choice, why would we have Ex-Gay therapy? Couldn't they just as easily choose to be straight? Why would it have such a low success rate? Political homosexuality does exist. However, that's mostly reserved for extreme radical feminists and masculinists. They are naturally straight, but choose to date within their gender as some sort of political statement or due to intense hatred of the opposite gender. I want to see if maybe there are logical, non-religious reasons why people could believe it's a conscious choice after tackling those factors I listed. (Keeping in mind that choosing to act on homosexual attraction and choosing to be homosexual are two different things.) CMV.
