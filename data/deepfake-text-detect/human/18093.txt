There are a lot of people who claims this, that alcohol makes thing more fun. At social gathering, people have alcohol to have a good time. Or to "loosen" things up. They can really be themselves when they drink. They are a completely different person with a few drinks in them. I used to drink a lot in when I started college. All of those things above applied to me back than. And then I grew up. The post-alcohol fun person became the same pre-alcohol person. Suddenly being inebriated made things less fun, because I wasn't fully able to enjoy the experience. Because I wouldn't be able to make the decision that led to the most fun. Because connections you made with people without alcohol is stronger than the ones with alcohol. When anyone says alcohol makes fun more fun. They are basically saying the alcohol lowers their inhibition, which allows them to have more fun. Which means there are things they would do after drinking alcohol that they wouldn't do sober that make things more fun. Why wouldn't they do these things without alcohol? Because there is a disconnect between the person they want to be, and the person they are. For whatever reason, they are afraid to do so when they are sober, they need the excuse of alcohol to remove their inhibition to be this "fun" person. They are insecure about themselves. There are people who enjoys the taste of alcohol. Or take advantage of the nutritional value of alcohol. I am only talking about people who thinks things are more fun with alcohol. CMV.
