This place is VERY messy and unorganized. The guy at front was often talking on the phone when I was standing at the front desk waiting for assistance. Lots of advertisement that he will make you a deal but in all reality he won't. Just about all his items are over priced. Maybe if he would make a deal with someone the prices would be reasonable. Also advertised items on Craigslist that he never had in the first place. Overall not impressed or satisfied.
