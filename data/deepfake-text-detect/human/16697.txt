Motivated by biochemical reaction networks, a generalization of the classical secant condition for the stability analysis of cyclic interconnected commensurate fractional-order systems is provided. The main result presents a sufficient condition for stability of networks of cyclic interconnection of fractional-order systems when the digraph describing the network conforms to a single circuit. The condition becomes necessary under a special situation where coupling weights are uniform. We then investigate the robustness of fractional-order linear networks. Robustness performance of a fractional-order linear network is quantified using the H 2 -norm of the dynamical system. Finally, the theoretical results are confirmed via some numerical illustrations.
