As the title says, I believe that chess should have a perfectly mirrored set up. I was taught how to play chess by my cousin, who incorrectly taught me to play this way. The games I played this way were much more competitive, and seemed to make more sense to me in a logically. Of course, playing with other people, I quickly learned the correct way to set up a chess board, and became a great chess player. But the correct way to set up a chess board has continued to baffle me for all these years. The player that goes first seems to have a bit of an advantage, even in professional chess. I feel that a mirrored set up cuts down on that advantage a bit. CMV Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
