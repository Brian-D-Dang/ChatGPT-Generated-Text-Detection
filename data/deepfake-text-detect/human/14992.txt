Yum, this is my favorite breakfast place on the Strip. While the prices are high, the food is worthy of the price and leaves me longing for more. I love the red, black, and white modern decor, which fits nicely with the general decor of the casino. I had some type of a hollandaise breakfast sandwich. I don't even like hollandaise but loved this! It was sumptuous, filling, and the perfect morning-after meal. Coffee and water are plentiful and there's was plenty of great people-watching. The cafe looks out onto the casino and is one of the easier places to get into. Alcoholic morning beverages are plentiful with an drink cart that circulates.
