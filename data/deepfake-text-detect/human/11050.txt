The Phantom uses a noose to strangle people (referred to in the original novel as a "Punjab Lasso by pulling it tight about their neck. By holding one's hand up, once can prevent the noose from tightening.','It's explained in the lyrics a couple of times, although if you watched a non-musical version (or a sub-par performance of the musical), it's unsurprising that it doesn't get across. There's a trackmusical interlude called "Magical Lasso," in which Joseph Bouquet tells the chorus girls, "you must be always on your guard, or he will catch you with his magical lasso" but that just explains the Punjab Lasso; sets up for later. At the end of "Point of No Return," there's a scuffle in which Madame Giree tells Raoul she knows where to find Christine. But remember, your hand at the level of your eyes! But why? Why?! The Punjab Lasso, monsieur! First Signor Piange [has been found hanged], now thishurry, or we shall be too late!
