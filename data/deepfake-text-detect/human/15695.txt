Just moved to this side of town and am always looking for good Chinese food. I drove past the sign and decided to check it out. I didn't know it was mostly a take out place but once I was there decided to give it a try anyhow. I was surprised to see how reasonable to prices were - great lunch specials. I ordered the Mongolian beef for myself and the Teriyaki chicken bowl for my husband. The food took about 15 minutes so I was confidant everything was cooked to order. Everything was delicious!! I would have given it 5 stars but when I pulled up outside at 11:15am (supposed to open at 11am) the doors to the place were still locked and lights off.... I was about to pull away when the owners showed up and welcomed me in. I am glad they caught me otherwise I would have missed out!!
