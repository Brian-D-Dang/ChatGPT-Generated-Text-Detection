Don't believe the hype! I won't say this place is awful, but it's nothing to write home about. I heard about BFG over a year ago, and I kind of forgot about it. It resurfaced in my mind a few days ago, and I just had to try it. Maybe I expected too much? I ordered the baked chicken. with the mac and cheese. Don't expect to just walk in and get your food in a minute or two. You'll be waiting a few, especially if they are busy. It's completely worth it though... the food was still steaming by the time I got to my house in the Aliante area. I was impressed. My order consisted of baked chicken with honey mustard and BFG sauce, and the mac and cheese. The chicken was fine. Nothing that I couldn't prepare myself. The mac and cheese was completely disappointing! It looks so good from the pictures I've seen, but it was complete bland. A soupy mac and cheese covered in cheese. Boring! The best thing on my plate was the honey mustard sauce. That's kinda sad.... The service is awesome. The staff is really friendly! I think I paid just under 7 bucks, which really wasn't bad. I just wish the good was better.
