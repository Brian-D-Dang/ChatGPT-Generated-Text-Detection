I think this one might be quite unexpected on reddit. As a typical redditor I am 100 pro-vaccines. Both my parents are doctors and they have always told me how ignorant and stupid people who did not vaccinate their children were. I agreed with them and did not try to make any further research as it seemed quite right to me (and also because I was not profoundly interested in that topic as a childless old teenager). I have been with this girl who is a total hippy! Things are going great and we tend to agree on most of the things. Yesterday we talked about that topic and she told me how anti-vaccine she was and how it seems there is no way she could change her mind. She is a very open minded person and I know that she has reasons to believe in what she believes. I have been doing some research and had a hard time finding arguments anti vaccine. Reddit, I know it is going to be hard for you but, change my view! I want to be against vaccines Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
