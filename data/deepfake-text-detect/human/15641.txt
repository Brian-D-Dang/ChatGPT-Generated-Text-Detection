This is the main branch for the Carnegie Library and it is needless to say, HUGE. The place holds more books than you can imagine, and even if they don't have it, you can bet that one of the other branches have it. They'll request a copy of anything that your heart desires and it'll be sent right away. I requested a copy of Steven King's It and it came in around 2 days (don't judge my taste in movies). I love coming here to study, relax, browse, or even just to hang out with friends. They don't have a great selection in movies but hey, I should just go read a book anyway.
