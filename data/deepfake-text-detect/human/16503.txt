Currently in the domain of facial analysis single task approaches for face detection and landmark localization dominate. In this paper we draw attention to multi-task models solving both tasks simultaneously. We present a highly accurate model for face and landmark detection. The method, called MaskFace, extends previous face detection approaches by adding a keypoint prediction head. The new keypoint head adopts ideas of Mask R-CNN by extracting facial features with a RoIAlign layer. The keypoint head adds small computational overhead in the case of few faces in the image while improving the accuracy dramatically. We evaluate MaskFace's performance on a face detection task on the AFW, PASCAL face, FDDB, WIDER FACE datasets and a landmark localization task on the AFLW, 300W datasets. For both tasks MaskFace achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming many of single-task and multi-task models.
