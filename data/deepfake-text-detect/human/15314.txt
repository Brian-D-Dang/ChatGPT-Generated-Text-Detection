Went here while in PHX on business with a friend who lives locally. Thought it would be a good place to have some dinner since I love BBQ. No such luck. Nothing seemed like real BBq just over cooked and tasteless. Very Chain resturant-y, Cool memorabilia abut that's about it. They only give a small cup of BBQ sauce for your meal. I don't reccommend.
