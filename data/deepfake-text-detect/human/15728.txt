It might be my first check in but I've been here three times already. This time I brought my boyfriend with me. They have a wide range of flavors when it comes to milktea, tea or snow bubble (my personal favorite). Lychee is usually my go to flavor but I have also tried their passion fruit which was delicious. They can also mix flavors for you like caramel thai tea snow bubble that my boyfriend asked for. The staff is super friendly and easy to talk to. The price is very reasonable. You get a drink for under 5! Overall, this spot definitely satisfies my boba cravings:)
