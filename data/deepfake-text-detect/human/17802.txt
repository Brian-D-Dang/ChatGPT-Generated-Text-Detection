I just read this [article] , and I agree with its reasoning. Firstly he defines reclaiming a word as "the oppressed group is able to remove the sting of a derogatory term specific to their group by using it among other members." Basically, the only word that has kind of been reclaimed is the n-word, but that still packs a huge sting, so he argues it hasn't been effectively reclaimed. He argues that while minorities should be able to use these words, the rest of the population is not equipped to understand why they can't use these words and that, "When a white kid sees his favorite rapper use the word, he assumes that, despite the historical significance of its oppressive qualities, it's now fine to say the n-word." He argues that feminist attempts to reclaim words will be counter-productive in the same way. I agree with his argument. CMV. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
