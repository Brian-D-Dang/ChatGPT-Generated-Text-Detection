You have it in reverse, a musician typically makes more money from a tour than record sales. There are many ways to structure a record deal. A typical record deal will consist of the label signing the artist to produce X number of albums for X royalty. The royalty rate is usually 10-15. However, it is not usually based on gross but net sales. Also a 4 tag of processing is often tacked on per physical unit that cannot be part of the balance subject to royalty for the artist (on a 16 cd the artist only gets paid based off 12, assuming it was a full price sale). The advance is an interest free loan in the sense that that too much be recouped before the artist sees any royalty payments. The cost of recording, marketing, and promotion is also calculated against the artist and must be repaid first as well. If the albums producer worked for points rather than a flat fee he too will be paid first. The real money in music is in live performance (with merchandise sales) and licensing (unless you are an idiot and signed away the copyright to the label). Unless you are under a 360 deal, the label does not get a cut of this. Record labels provide a very valuable tool to musicians in marketing and promotion, and for this they reap the majority of profits from the album sales. However, now that you have a fanbase thanks to aforementioned promotion, you can license your works to tv, movies, games etc and hit the road touring with an already established fanbase to build off of.
