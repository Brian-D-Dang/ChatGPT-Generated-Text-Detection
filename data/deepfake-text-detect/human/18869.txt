To be clear I'm not disputing the existence of social constructs. What I am disputing is the phenomenon of dismissing a common belief or behavior as "just a social construct," as if social constructs are totally arbitrary and have no deeper significance. My position is that these constructs must necessarily have arisen out of natural factors, and that those natural factors are still around today. My reasoning for this is that social influence could not always have been in play; hundreds of thousands of years ago there was no such thing as language and thus "social constructs" could not exist. My idea is that once language developed, the first and most enduring social constructs grew out of instinctual behavior. Further (though my knowledge of genetics is admittedly limited) I believe the scientific consensus is that genetics (nature) tend to have more bearing on individual behavior than social context or upbringing (nurture). If this is true, a given "social construct" could only attain widespread prevalence if it appealed to something inherent in the physical makeup of a large group of humans. And for the record - by no means am I implying that just because a behavior is "natural" it is acceptable. What I am stating is that many so-called social constructs are too deeply rooted in the human psyche to be easily altered or removed. Change my view. Hello, users of CMV!
