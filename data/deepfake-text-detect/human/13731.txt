For Christmas, we decided it would be a good idea to get a new puppy. We went to the pet store to look around and choose the one we wanted. A little black and white puppy looked lonely in the corner. She was scared and shaking, it was clear she didn't want to be there. We chose that puppy and brought her home to be part of our family.
