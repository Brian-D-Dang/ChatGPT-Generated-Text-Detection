When you quickly move your eyes, the pictures your eyes send are full of motion blur. Your brain knows that and literally forgets those few milliseconds that you need to focus. That way you think you immediately focus on a new thing, but your brain actually does it for you, and only tells you that you immediately focused on a thing.','I don't think the other two comments so far answer the question. The OP isn't asking why she doesn't see blur; nor is hisher question answered just by saying that the brain does it unconsciously. In fact, the brain uses a variety of "maps," i.e. groups of neurons which encoderepresent features of the environment. So even before you shift attention to a new location, your brain has non-conscious representations of the locations of objects. For our purposes, some of the most important maps are "salience maps," which encoderepresent the degree to which a visual location differs from its surrounding environment in terms of color, shape, movement, etc. For stimulus-driven shifts in attention (e.g. something "catches your eye, you first attend to the most "salient" location, then the second-most salient, etc. Your eyes will move around the scene in terms of decreasing visual salience. (For more details, see URL0) Still, how does the eye move to the most salient location or any other location without under- or over-shooting? Basically the eye movements are ballistic i.e. there is no correction "in flight." Rather, the brain uses its various spatial maps to compute how far the eyes must move to look at the appropriate location e.g. the currently most salient location and the muscles controlling the eyes apply the amount of force needed to move to that location.
