I hold the belief that if you have a group of two things, and combine it with another group of two things, the result is a group of four things. It doesn't matter what the thing is, but combining two and two should always make 4. I understand the counterargument about two things turning into one when the combination happens (that is, for example, two oxygen atoms combined with two hydrogen atoms yields two things: a water molecule and a hydrogen atom), but if you count the atoms in that group, there are indeed 4 of them. Also, I've heard the argument of things being destroyed or created as a result of the combination of two groups. However, in all of these situations, there is at least one instant in which there are four things in the combined group. I have no reason to believe that under any circumstance, 2 2 should not lead to 4. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
