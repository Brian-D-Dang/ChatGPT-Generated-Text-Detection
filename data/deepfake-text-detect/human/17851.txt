Carbon trading is the best solution we currently have for regulating the environment. It's not a "tax" because no money is going for the government for it to distribute. Instead, carbon prices are regulated purely by market pressure. While some implementation details might vary, the principle is simply great: it increases the market price of products that have a bigger impact on the environmnet, leading consumers to try to make smarter decisions about what they consume. It rewards companies that are able to reduce their carbon footprint and creates a real financial incentive for organisations that are planting trees, recycling or sequestering carbon in any way. It should be applied to all kinds of hazardous materials: rare earth material in batteries are polluting the environment? Make that mining companies extracting or producing the material are forced to buy credits, that price will be reflected in the rest of the chain and companies who create successful recycling programs will be able to push a cheaper product to the market. If you are a small government libertarian, you should love it because it's a free market solution that keeps the government away from decisions If you are a tree hugger environmentalist you should love it because it creates financial incentives for saving the rainforests. Unless we brainwash the whole population in being altruists robots, it's the least bad solution we have out there. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
