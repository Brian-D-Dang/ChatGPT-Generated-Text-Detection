I believe that there is an oversimplification of biological sex that works to construct a system of a false binary between malefemale, most aptly shown by the existence of intersex people. Correlated to this is that gender is a social construct based on the performativity of sexed social behaviors. This being the case, neither are "naturally" deterministic to someone's identity which leaves a large possibility for gender expression. Women who are designated male at birth, men who are designated female at birth or a genderqueer person who identifies as neither are all valid identities without a gender binary. Change my view. I hold this view because of my identity as a transwoman and the identities of other gender nonconforming people.
