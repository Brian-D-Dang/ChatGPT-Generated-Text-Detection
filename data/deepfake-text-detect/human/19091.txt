Firstly, let me clarify that I am referring to pre college education, and that I am speaking from my personal experience. I consider American education to be flawed due to the behavior it encourages. Students, for the most part, are not encouraged to push themselves; the system rewards those who stay well within their capabilities and get a 4.0. Furthermore, it doesn't encourage actually learning the material. Instead, all that matters is scoring points. This turns school into a game; a game where those who know how to exploit the system can perform far better than those of superior skill who are unwilling or unable to exploit the system. Somebody restore my faith in my education... Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
