Occupy movement began in September 2011 with a great furor and excitement, and it was generally believed that it can bring about a great deal of change. I do have to agree that the whole idea had a very very wide outreach with Occupy movement's springing up everywhere all over the world. But by the end of 2012, the whole movement had fizzled out into just plain rhetoric with absolutely no direction to go towards. Everybody was asking for whatever they felt was right which ended up with achieving nothing. Please CMV if I am wrong.
