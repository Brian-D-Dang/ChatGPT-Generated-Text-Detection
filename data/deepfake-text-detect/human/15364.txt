This is one of those amazing places that could easily be overlooked. For more than 14 years, the owners of Cafe Forte have tirelessly made a name for themselves by providing unadulterated cuisine or comfort foods for folks who like their meals freshly made with only quality ingredients. BRAND NEW Comfort Hours from 3-5pm features awesome appetizers like their roasted Polenta cakes! They also feature 4 glasses of select wines and beers, too! One of their signature dishes is the Cafe Meatloaf with a light burgundy sauce and smashed potatoes. They also feature many fresh seafood entrees as well as fine Italian specialties. Because the restaurant is located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, on Main Street, just east of Goldwater Blvd, you can enjoy the works of fine artists as well as the fine foods at Cafe Forte. I recommend beginning your meal with the baked brie and sliced apples along with a nice Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand. Casual atmosphere with little votives and a fresh flower on each table is what you will see when you first enter the main dining room. There is a bar area and when weather permits, an intimate garden for romantic dining. They also do amazing pies and tortes for dessert. Great for dinner on Thursday Artwalks or for a casual lunch with good friends!
