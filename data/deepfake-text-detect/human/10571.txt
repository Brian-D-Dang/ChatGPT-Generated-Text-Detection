To explain it would take, like, a college degree's worth of explaining. At the core of how all the parts work are the flow of electricity, and logic gates. These are little physical bits in those small chips. They take in voltage through two little wires, and have a third leading out. Depending on which kind of gate it is and which current is active, the third will or won't pass on the current according to rules. These rules correspond with Boolean logic (binary logic) rules, and clever combinations of those gates basically makes a computer. An example is an OR gate: of either or both of the incoming wires has voltage, the gate passes in the voltage. An AND gate would only do so if both incoming wires had voltage. What we think of as addition can be represented with combinations of these gates. Same with every other math operation. Memory and disk storage is just to record data, printers and speakers and monitors just report data to the user, but under all that, it's lots and lots of little logic gates, and clever programming.','They are binary digital circuits with one voltage signaling "1" and another (usually 0V) signaling "0." Some signals are your data, and other signals are indications like "the data on wires 1 through 8 is now set." within the chips are circuits specialized to perform specific operations, like a memory circuit that stores the data on its input wires in a specific location in its storage array when the "write" signal changes from "0" to "1.
