Please note that non-Americans of African descent are not included in the MLB number (I've seen 8.7 as the African American number). And please note that the "white" number for for the NBA does not differentiate between Americans and non-Americans. I imagine the number for white americans is much closer to 5, but I can't find that data. Also, Wikipedia reports that America is 72 white and 12 black. If anyone can explain why a percentage in professional sports that reflects those demographics is not completely acceptable, I'd be interested to hear that and a good argument on that score will help to CMV.
