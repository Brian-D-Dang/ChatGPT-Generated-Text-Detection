Good, but too expensive.... Visited The Sharp Edge Bistro on a Thursday night. The place has a warm and inviting bistro feel, although a bit sparse as you move away for the bar area. They have a great selections of beers in bottle and on tap. Much to our dismay, the menu selection of beers wasn't what was available on tap - rather disappointing when you are trying to make a meal choice. Service on our night was terribly slow, there was plenty of staff available who only seemed interested in socializing and milling about in a large brood at the back of the Bistro. At a place that specializes in beer, waiting 15 minutes for a drink is ridiculous. One of the many idle server could have easily said, Hey, would you like another? - but they didn't. Lame. The Blue cheese flatiron steak frite was very good, and the Sharp Burger was as well. The desserts we sampled - a waffle with raspberry sauce and an the butter pecan napoleon were excellent...... But here's the rub - Value. Shoddy service aside, 11 beers and 12 hamburgers are a joke. I love Belgian ales and understand they are not cheap, BUT the food and drink are overpriced. 2 Burgers 4 beers w 2 desserts are going to set you back close to 90.00 w tip!! The food and drink are good, but at that price there are LOT's of other dinning options other than a burger and a beer. Solid 3 star place with 2 star value.
