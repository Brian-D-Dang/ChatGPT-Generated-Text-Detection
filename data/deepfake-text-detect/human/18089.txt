I think that debating online in a format similar to Reddit (updown votes, collapsible comment threads etc) is the best way of debating. The debaters can post links and images supporting their thesis, they can quote exact words from their opponent and you can have multiple debaters. I can see this as superior than on tv political debates for elections and as superior to face to face debates between friends. So my point is that a written online forum (similar to reddit) would be the ideal medium for political (or informal) debate and should be used more than tv debates or face to face debates. CMV
