EDIT: Title should say "I watched 2 and 12 seasons." I've tried. I saw it on Netflix a few years ago, and thought, "I see this a lot of Pinterest, (don't judge) it's supposed to be mind-blowingly good." I started with the 9th Doctor. The episode was incredibly disappointing. The effects weren't all that great, the writing was eh, everything sort of came together at the end just because. But that was the first episode, surely the rest of the series will be mindblowingly awesome. I skipped ahead to a David Tennant season (I think it was season 3), and it was alright. Better than the 1st season, but not mindorgasmic. So I went back to season 2. I haven't gotten past the Cyberman episodes. I have tried watching that fucking episode on three or four different occasions, and once I actually finished it, there's another fucking episode. Cybermen are supposed to be a big deal right? Yet for some reason, I struggled to finish just one episode. Doctor Who is not the worst show I've ever seen. From what I've seen it's just eh. Like I said, the acting is fine, the writing okay, the conclusions seem to always utilize deus ex machina (because the Doctor just happens to know everything), and the special effects are.... yeah. Please, please, please CMV
