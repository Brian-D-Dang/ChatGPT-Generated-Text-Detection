It just didn't make any sense. All I wanted to was to give a service to people, to fulfill an actual need. There was so much opportunity in the current market, which is why I majored in business. I dreamed of making the next hit product that the world would go nuts for. And, to be honest, there was the more obvious answer: I would have virtually no business competition. If I could just get something started, boom, instant monopoly, and there was no way the government could stop me- after all, the politicians were all clowns. But I just couldn't figure out a need. All these people cared about was being clowns. How could I even sell them anything, even if they were willing to buy from me? Then it hit me: clown cars. Believe me, this was the last thing I wanted to build my business around, but there just didn't seem to be any other way. Besides, if I was looking for public hit, this was it. I chuckled to myself. All those stupid clowns, putting me down for years. They had the nerve to laugh at me? We'll see who's laughing now..... well, maybe still them, but I'll be laughing harder.
