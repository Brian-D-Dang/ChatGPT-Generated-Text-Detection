It seems to me that if a person holds the belief that a foetus and a person are entirely the same thing, they hold a moral obligation to fight it by any means possible, even through violence. In event of genocide, there's a general consensus that violence is an acceptable way to prevent or stop it. An anti-abortionist, it seems to me, is under the impression that a genocide against foetuses is currently under way in a very large portion of the world. And so I believe it is morally wrong for them to not resort to terrorism or otherwise extreme action. What I mean to imply through this belief is that nobody really believes that foetuses are people except for those nut-cases who are blowing up abortion clinics. CMV.
