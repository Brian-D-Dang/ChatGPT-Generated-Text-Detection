When I hear people talking about 'a second revolution' in America, it makes me roll my eyes. Historically speaking, revolutions don't seem to have a high success rate, if you define a successful revolution as one that overthrows the established power and sets up a superior government to previous one, I would say that most revolutions don't work out well. The American Revolution is the only one I can think of that didn't make the country worse off than before -and that is sort of debatable- and set up a functional government. Now when I look at recent uprisings in Libya and Syria, I can't see armed rebellion ever being a good alternative. How many people have been killed in the Syria uprising? How many cities and towns have been ruined? A lot more than would have been without a rebellion. More so now than before, with how destructive our weaponry is, if a rebellion doesn't achieve a quick and decisive victory the country will be torn apart and the winner will be picking up the broken, shattered pieces of a nation. TL;DR Revolutions usually aren't historically successful without incredible loss of life and generally result in an inferior government or one that is no better than the one overthrown.
