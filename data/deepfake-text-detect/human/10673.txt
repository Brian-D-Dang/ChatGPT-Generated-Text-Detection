Melting points are mostly determined by the molecular structure of the object. The melting point actually changes under different pressure, but generally when you hear about melting points people are assuming it's under standard atmospheric pressure. The melting point is determined by the amount of thermal energy required to break bonds in the atoms. Higher temperatures means more thermal energy and higher melting points.
