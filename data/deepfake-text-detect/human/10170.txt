From a legacy standpoint, AJ is probably the least deserving amongst the figures on American paper currency (Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Hamilton, Grant, Franklin). It's not like the guy didn't have good qualities or do good things while in office, but for a country that's trying to go in the direction of racialethnic inclusiveness, it's pretty baffling that the guy who's responsible for the trail of tears is on our currency. That being said, I thought it was interesting to see in the news that people are trying to change who is on the 20 bill; however, Harriet Tubman seems like an odd choice considering the other possible candidates. Off the top of my head, I think Teddy Roosevelt and MLK are the most deserving, and if I had to choose between them it would be MLK. Obviously, MLK's legacy speaks for itself, being the leader of the civil rights movement. Compared to Tubman I just feel like MLK's impact was far greater. His speeches and non-violent protests impacted the entire nation, millions of people, while Tubman saved 70 people from slavery. That's not to discredit Tubman because what she did was brave and important, and her accomplishments weren't limited to the underground railroad, but I think it's fair to say that MLK had a greater impact than Tubman, and therefore is more deserving to be placed on the 20 bill. I might even go as far to say that it's not even close. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
