A new wanderer shows on the scanner. Oblong and icy, it looks much like our wanderer did, when great-grandfather first found it. Looks much like the long string of comets and rocks the clan has mined and farmed and used up, passing kilometer by kilometer further out into the black darkness between the stars. I ping it, note position and velocity. Easy to reach, a promising new campsite, new source of precious volatiles for fusing and drinking and growing. Then I realize..... this wanderer is different. It's not bound by distant Sol, nor flying free like our current home. This wanderer is falling towards different stars, falling toward Centauri. Now the clan must decide what to do. Do we keep drifting in the darkness, or follow the wanderer inward? Memory is cheap: I have seen the records and videos showing how our distant ancestors fled crowded earth to the asteroids, to the outer moons, to the Kuiper belt and Oort. They were always at the front, always restless to move onward. Each step took them further from support, taught them stage at a time to survive on cold, scarce scraps of rock and ice. Our records can tell our descendants how to tap the vast wealth of a new solar system. But they can not tell us what they will become if we start on this new orbit. Will they stop wandering and settle down. Will they grow crowded and controlling, the very thing our ancestors fled?
