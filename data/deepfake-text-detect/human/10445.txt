Soviet Union. Russia was a state of the Soviet Union. It technically took the Germans a while to reach Russia after they invaded. Anyway, Hitler had been talking about invading the Soviet Union for Lebensraum (Living Space) since the early 1920s when he was early in his political career. He believed that Germans needed more room, on farms, and that the lands to the East would provide these lands, after enough of their native populations had been worked and starved to death. He didn't invade on some whim in 1941, it wasn't because Germany needed oil for their war machine, it was because EVERYTHING he had done since becoming Reichskanzler in 1933 was in preparation of invading the Soviet Union. He even wrote a book that said so in the 1920s called "Mein Kampf.,'Russia would have invaded Germany eventually, too. Also, the oil fields in South Russia were important to fuel a mechanized army (the Germans were converting coal into fuel for their army).', "To paraphrase Eddie Izzard, it's because he was a stupid man who never played RISK as a child. 7 extra men at the beginning of every turn, but you can never fuckin hold (Asia)...
