I believe taxation is wrong and classifies as a legal form of theft. It's a form of theft that's accepted because the government chooses to use a different term. Because of this, I believe I have no obligation to pay taxes. If it weren't for the threat of jail time, I wouldn't pay taxes. I believe economic liberals (and economic conservatives where applicable) who support taxation should voluntarily pay more than they already do in taxes. If taxation is an efficient and ethical mean towards a given end, they should be tapping into their personal source of disposable income to contribute even more of their own money to the government.
