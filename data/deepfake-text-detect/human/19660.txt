The current Aus v India series hasn't had the greatest umpiring in history, that's for sure, but if India is opposed to the system that is in place to make these bad decisions possible to overturn, then they shouldn't complain about the bad decisions. MS Dhoni also seems to not quite understand how the system works, when he says It is a very interesting question, but what is more important is that there are a lot of 50-50 decisions that are not going in our favour... We are at the receiving end more often than not. And what happens in DRS, even when the DRS is around, those decisions won't go in our favour." The whole point of DRS is to get rid of the clearly bad decisions, and what this statement tells me is that Dhoni doesn't understand that clearly bad decisions are not 50-50, and they will in fact be overturned if reviewed. Also it tells me that they don't want DRS until it is biased to them. Cricket probably isn't a universal topic on this sub, but for those of you who do follow it, change my view. Hello, users of CMV!
