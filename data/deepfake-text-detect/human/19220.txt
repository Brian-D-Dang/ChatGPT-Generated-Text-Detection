I'll start by saying I'm a pretty liberal guy when it comes to sex, and this isn't really a moral hangup I have. I'm okay with pornography and I support the decriminalization of prostitution (don't know enough about regulation to support legalization yet), but I am of the opinion that people who have sex for money, whether they are paid directly or indirectly for it, do so because they can't do anything better with their lives and they mistakenly think they are talented just for being attractive and doing what pretty much anyone else can do. This is supported by the fact that very few of them genuinely love their jobs- the more of your comfort level you can sell out, the more successful you'll be. I feel like my view is problematic because I hold a double standard towards prostitutes. If their price is cheap, I'll think "wow, they must be really desperate for cash and have no real skills, they don't even value their bodies highly!" But if they're an expensive escort, I'll think "hundreds of dollars for essentially being a pretty cum receptacle? Is their pussy made of gold or something?" It's like, if they've established "sex" to be "work," what makes them think they're worth that much? I also don't think it's right to compare them to actors or massage therapists. Good non-porn actors have to get into character and convey a wide range of emotions that may not come naturally to them; sex workers just have to moan and thrash around, maybe wear a cheap costume for a non-convincing roleplay. Maybe be unique enough to appeal to fetishists. Massaging actually does take a bit more skill, it's more difficult than just letting strangers have their way with you. But then again, I don't have a lot of respect people whose best talent is that they can rub my back and make me feel good.
