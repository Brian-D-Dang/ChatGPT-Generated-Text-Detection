I believe that people who live in the western world have a moral responsibility to live as frugally as possible and not spend money on luxuries like high tech electronics, diamond rings and expensive cars because those things come at the direct expense of other nations and people. The fact that [our phone parts] fund war in the Congo and that huge swaths of everything we purchase is made In sweatshops is part of an overall trend of developed countries saping resources from other nations at the great expense of their citizens. I feel the only way to combat this is to be anti-consumerist, otherwise you are complicate (or at least ignorant to) the suffering of the worlds poor. Hello, users of CMV!
