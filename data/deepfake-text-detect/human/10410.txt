In the usa gay marraige is always being debated in the media and in politics. Like most controversy in the usa it is assumed that there are only two sides to the debate; Gay marraige should be legal or illegal. I think both arguments have legitimate grievances. On the gay rights side, gay people deserve all the same rights as straight people. On the other side, many beleif systems have very specific definitions of what constitutes marraige and those guidelines cant be changed by the legal system. The solution to this problem is remove marraige from the legal system. By law neither straight or gay couples can marry. Marraige would still exist as a religious tradition, and gay people still get equal treatment under the law.
