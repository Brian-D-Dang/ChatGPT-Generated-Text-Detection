I'm actually in a research lab where we study the effects and causes of itch. It is a field that is not very well known and is currently under a lot of study. Itch is most likely something we evolved to remove insects and other things from our skin so we wouldn't get sick or something. Now, you feel an itch because of some neurological signal going to your brain, we have seen that there can be a correlation between the neurons responsible for itch, and pain. Without going into detail, basically, scratching can activate your pain neurons to some small degree, which has an inhibitory effect on the neurons sending the itchy signals. Thus, your itch is gone. Let me know if you want me to get into it more.
