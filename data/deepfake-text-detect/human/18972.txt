While I like ACA overall , I think the employer mandate is a mistake . If I'm a business owner and I employ 70 workers full time , I'm now motivated to move most if not all of my low skilled employees from full time status to part time status . This doesn't only affect full time workers , since anyone over 30 hours a week is now considered full time . This creates anouther problem , instead of a low wage worker being able to get by with 33 hours a week at one job and maybe 10 hours at a side job , he has to go out and find a 3rd job (which is near impossible since his jobs will not care about resolving schedule conflicts). This isn't about what is right or what is wrong , or what a business can afford to do. (Keep in mind most restaurants close within 3 years of opening , its very hard to make a profit) It's about what's the most logical . Even if a business has an absolute need for full time workers, they can move the company up to Canada , pay workers a bit more , and still come out ahead of if they stayed in the states . Higher paid jobs will have a benefits program already in place, but this should be between the employer and employee. The employee mandate only will make it harder to find work for low skilled workers . CMV As a side note I don't really like the employee-employer healthcare system as is , since I have to surrender my personal medical information (what pre-existing conditions , etc) to my employer . The healthcare exchange seems like the way to go since it takes employers out of the equation entirely.
