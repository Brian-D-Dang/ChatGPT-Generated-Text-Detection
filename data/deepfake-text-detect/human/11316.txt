Waymo has begun to ramp up its operations by offering an early rider program to selected customers. These customers are selected based on ZIP code and are required to sign NDAs. The customers won't be able to request a fully driverless ride, but they will be matched with a driverless car if one is nearby. Driverless rides are currently free. The decision to operate fully-autonomous driverless cars shows Waymo's confidence in its technology. The firm has completed 10 million real-world miles and 10 billion simulation miles. Fully driverless rides are currently only taking place in a geofenced area, implying that Waymo's confidence levels are still highly situational. One of the problems with driverless rides is the user experience. Passengers might have issues with specifying exact drop-off points or communicating plan changes. Waymo's user experience research team is currently working on these challenges.
