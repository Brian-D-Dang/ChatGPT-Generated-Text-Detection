If I'm in an ordinary US restaurant, I don't really know what the prices is... it's whatever's on the menu plust some unspecified amount that's based on shame. If I pay any less than whatever is expected (and the amount varies depending on the kind of restaurant and service), I'm some kind of asshole. Why? Because somehow restaurants are granted an exception to minimum wage laws because of tipping so now they're basically working for free unless I make up the difference. But bad laws aren't my fault nor are they my responsibility. The next excuse is that it improves customer service, but having standards and holding to them solves that problem. When I worked retail, I helped people to the best of my ability because that's what you're supposed to do. If waiters aren't making people feel welcome, then it's not my responsibility to make it known by tips. Even worse, the employee tips can be affected by the quality and timliness of the cooks, whether the restaurant is understaffed, whether they have to share the tips with kitchen staff or with management... it's just an enormous moronic mess and I hate it. There's nothing good about tipping and it should be abolished. I would think that everyone would agree, but they don't. What am I missing?
