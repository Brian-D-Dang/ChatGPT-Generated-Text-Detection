I understand the argument that an employer should fund all of an employees pay. However, with a large chunk of my wages coming from tips, it encourages me to act to the best of my serving ability. Likewise, I reward good service when I eat out. Note: I could envision a few compromises such as slightly raising employer paid wages, or requiring a minimum tip, but I strongly believe that the majority of people tip better when receiving exceptional service Background: I wait tables in a fine dining scenario, and only hostedback waited at "lower end restaurants." Any commentary from servers of that viewpoint would be greatly appreciated
