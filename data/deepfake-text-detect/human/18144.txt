All of these videos of bad cops are complete bullshit-or should I say- the PUBLIC'S OPINION on cops are complete bullshit. I was inspired to submit this post due to a recent front page post that had a score of 3500 showing a few videos of police officers taking advantage of their power and severally beating the innocent, with heavily supported comments along the lines of "cops are able to lie on their reports and get away with whatever they want!" The facts are as follows: 1) There are different kinds of people in any profession who range from taking their jobs seriously to not seriously, and range from shitty to fantastic at their choice of profession. 2) We don't know the exact details of these situations prior to most of these videos. My Uncle is a cop, and hates his life when he gets a neighbor hood complaint call to go to a low-rental home and deal with an abusive husband. He has to now intervene and control the situation in the chaotic house. how THE FUCK do you people expect cops to be so damn perfect?! TO CLARIFY; I think these officers abusing their uniform are repulsive. I am simply saying it would be difficult to keep 100 of trained personnel to make the right decisions in multiple close-encounters that contain high-emotional stress levels in possible life threatening situations. EDIT: dear everyone, I am really sorry i did not follow the rules exactly to stay on for the next few hours to reply right away. I was tired and had to do stuff. But I will be checking frequently!
