What matters most about an idea is whether it is true, not its political ramifications such as subversiveness, sexism, racism, anti-semitism, etc. Those aspects are about whose power and legitimacy the idea undermines, and they have no bearing on truth, which should be the only thing that determines the believability of an idea. Here is an example of a true racist idea: ice age adaptations make caucasians less athletic than black people. It's mainly noticeable at the extremes: the best black athletes are better than the best white athletes. I should believe this idea because evidence supports it, and not be afraid of the power dynamics it may disrupt. That is intellectual integrity.
