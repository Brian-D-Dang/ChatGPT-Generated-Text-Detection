I don't have either and I really don't have huge problems concentrating while studying (I procrastinate a lot but it's not overly debilitating). Legaldisciplinary consequences are practically non-existent because I would get a single dose from my friend, so I can't get caught. Abuse of the drug should not be a problem either since I am not using it for recreation or even on a consistent basis (if I decide to take it). I just want to do this to make my studying more effective and faster for finals. I will still most likely get A's even if I don't take the meds. EDIT: Ok so I'm convinced not to try tomorrow, the day before my test. Still, why not try during a less time stressful day and observe how it reacts with my system as a test run? EDIT2: I just read that it only lasts a few hours, so if I take it tomorrow morning and have my test 20 hours after taking it, it shouldn't be a problem during my test.
