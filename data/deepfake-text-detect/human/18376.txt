Electric toothbrushes are just another product in the increasing trend of objects that have gone electric when they don't really need to. Regular toothbrushes are dirt cheap, so much so that dentists don't mind giving you one for "free" after a teeth cleaning and hotels don't mind giving you a complimentary one if you forgot yours. The same can't be said of electric toothbrushes which are expensive because of the technology they contain. The technology inside an electric toothbrush makes it more fragile than an ordinary one. People drop toothbrushes on the ground, they drop them in the toilet, they get thrown around in travel bags. The electric toothbrush does not fare well in those described conditions. At the end of the day, the electric toothbrush does the same job that you can do yourself with a regular toothbrush.
