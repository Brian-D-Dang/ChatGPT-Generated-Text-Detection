I believe that a full grown adult male could fight and overpower a dog of just about any size. I am an average-sized man of very average build, but I believe my intellect and obvious evolutionary advantages (i.e. thumbs, limbs that move in many directions) would allow me to gain the upper hand and defeat a dog or wolf. For example, I may get bitten (and pretty severely), but I could break the dog's arm, gouge their eyes out, or tear at their ears. I could use rocks and other tools I find lying around. I believe a dog or wolf would be easily turned off by this and give up. Friends of mine have presented the argument that the dog has no fear for its own life in the same way that I do. It has nothing but a survival instinct and I would be a soft human. This may be more or less true, but I still believe that in the actual situation I would also be full of that survival instinct. I see movies where people are attacked by dogs and wolves and am never particularly worried, even though characters frequently die. Anyway, please change my view? Hello, users of CMV!
