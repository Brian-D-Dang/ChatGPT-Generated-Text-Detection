Let's assume that consciousness exists. 1. The brain is biological but also eletrochemical (stress on electro) because of the way each neuron interacts with every other neuron via electrical synapses. 2. The key aspect of the brain is not the neurons themselves but the set and pattern of electrical synapses in the brain. 3. Consciousness is therefore about those electrical synapses. 4. The study of electrons or electrical behaviour falls under particle physics which operates under Quantum Mechanics which is probabilistic. 5. Therefore, consciousness is quantum and probabilistic.
