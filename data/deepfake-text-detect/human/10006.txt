I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural exercise of contortion. Forks and knifes are superior in every way I can imagine in every situation. Including: rice that is sticky and particularly rice that isn't sticky. versatility while eating different kinds of food eating with manners not having to fear the dreaded fall of food I hope some of you will be able to help me find arguments to coerce me into using those chopsticks:) Update Some facts I've accepted regarding the chopsticks: Exercise fine motor skills Give time to taste the food and appreciate it Can be used while doing other things Are easier to clean, produce and carry Are superior if you want to: Preserve the integrity of the food you eat (If you don't want to break a grapevine until it's in your mouth) Eat crusty things (popcorns, cheetos, peanuts...) without dirtying your hands Eat leafs or salad You can have makeshift chopsticks easily while makeshift knifes and forks are still not a thing in 2015. Historically better at not stabbing your enemy during dinner? Let this be noted, the spoon and the spork were proposed and I'm all in their favors! As for the sporfe, knifoon and spooned knork I'm more dubious. All of this may be quite situational but in those situations I accept chopsticks as superior. Hello, users of CMV!
