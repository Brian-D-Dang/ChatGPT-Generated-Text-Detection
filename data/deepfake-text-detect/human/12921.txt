"Come and play, motherfucker," the Yellow Assassin said. "Everything's A-OK." Green of the Trash growled his war cry and launched himself from the can. "This ass-kicking is brought to you by the letters F and U!" he howled. Blades clashed. Fur flew; feathers fluttered. Blood. Blood was shed on the Street. Fuckyouupabunch swung his bladed trunk out from the darkness of the alley. Green of the Trash fell, clutching his leg. He rolled to safety. "If you had tusks," Green said, "you'd be a lot scarier." The hairy elephant growled. "Release the Duo." The Yellow Assassin gasped. "We can't," he hissed. "Fucking do it, bitch!" Yellow called it in. Roused from their twin beds, the world's greatest killers entered the street. Green cowered. Or appeared to. Killer B and Killer E stepped closer. "You're fucking dead," one said. I couldn't tell you which. I can never remember. Green of the Trash smiled. "There's something you didn't Count on," he said. Swooping down from the sky, in a flurry of blood and teeth, came the Dark Numericist. Soon, there was nothing left of the Killers. The four remaining fighters faced each other. The Yellow Assassin and the Elephantine Murderer said, in unison. "Release the Monster." Green of the Trash and The Count bared their teeth. "Release..... Elmo."
