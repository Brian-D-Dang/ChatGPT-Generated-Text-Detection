Before I begin I want to be clear that I am referring to a love that you actually feel. Like your stomach knotting up or anything like that. Not just a love you have for family or friends, but a physical feeling that many call love. (usually happens between two significant others) So before humans were conscious there were other animals, some being very similar to humans today. These animals can't just be programmed to have sex with another, they have to want it. Being an animal, they may have had some emotions help guide them like love. It felt something that made it want to do something. I see many people today say that they love another because they can just feel it, or it's just right. But we are just humans still being guided by many emotions, such as love and we need to recognize this so we can progress as a whole. I think too many people feel love and just go with it before thinking if it is the best choice for THEIR life. We are taught that love is good and something we "find." But I believe it is just an old emotion passed down evolution to help keep animals reproducing. CMV edit-somewhat quickly my view has been changed.
