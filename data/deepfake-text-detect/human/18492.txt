I believe that women can have sex whenever they want. That means that any woman who wants sex can find a male who is willing to have sex with little to effort. A strategy as simple as asking strangers in a public place would eventually reap rewards. A guy could ask a million women to have sex with him in one night and probably not get a single yes. The sex might not be with their ideal candidate depending on the amount of effort put in and their standards, but the fact that women even get to make that distinction is proof enough in itself. There are many men who would grab the chance at sex with any woman, no questions asked. The fact that woman have this opportunity but don't always take advantage because of their standards only further solidifies my opinion. The saying goes, beggars can't be choosers, but choosers can definitely be choosy. I believe any woman can have sex whenever she wants it. CMV
