I just finished playing through KOTOR and loved it. The story, characters, drama, top-notch Bioware stuff. But I just don't understand the gameplay. And I guess this goes for most action RPG's, but I just don't understand the appeal of the gameplay. It's one thing when this sort of D20 gameplay is on pen and paper, but presented as it is in KOTOR, it just comes off to me as clunky and tedious. Watching my 'elite' character with extensive combat experience firing and missing repeatedly at fifteen feet, or seeing as my highly advanced blaster shoots a man in the chest and knocks off tenth of his health, it just completely breaks immersion. Like when you need to hit a droid five times with a lightsaber it just comes off as absurd. Watching these powerful characters with powerful weapons struggle and toil to kill a large moth and missing half their attacks just drives me insane. How is this fun? Clicking on an enemy and watching as my elite soldier stands around in the open taking pot shots at a distance of twenty feet and still missing a third of the time. How is this fun? CMV
