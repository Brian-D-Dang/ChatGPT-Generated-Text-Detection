I recently moved down the street from Havana and I had heard great things. I've dined here a few times now and the food is amazing! My favorites are the Frituras de Frijoles Negros (black bean fritters,avocado dip) and Camarones Havana. So good!! The mojitos are really good too. The only problem with Havana is the speed of service. The servers are always friendly, but things take FOREVER to get to the table. Even my Mojito took 20 min last time. I will continue to come here for the killer food, but don't come if you are on any type of schedule, starving or really thirsty...it will take awhile.
