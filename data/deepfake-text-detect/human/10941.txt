I can tell you how aliens are supposed to decode our cultural heritage, in case we do intend them to find it. [Here] (URL0) is a link to all 116 images on the golden record sent into space with Voyager in 1977. At the very bottom there is a diagramm explaining how potential finders should work out how to play the record. Besides others, diagramms in binary code and of the hydrogen atom (as universal clock reference) are used. The question is, if something similar is in all those time capsule vaults on earth. I guess not, but that may be simply because we don't see the end of humanity as a possibility right now. Let's say, there is a big asteroid on its way here. That would be an appropriate time to leave something similar on earth. As uRadijs pointed out, the hyroglyphs were impossible to decode before having a reference. So unless we provide some points of refercence as kind of a manual, it would be pretty much impossible for anyone to make sense out of our language.', "It's very hard to answer a hypothetical like this, since we have no idea what the aliens are like and how they behave. If the aliens communicated telepathically, they might not even recognize our writing as language.
