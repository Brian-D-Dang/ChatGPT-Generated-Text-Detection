I believe that antibiotics are rendering immune-systems (in parts) obsolet. So the only effect a immune-system has is draining energy and due to evolutionary processes will eventually fade. Then one day antibiotic-resistant bacteria will occur and noone is able to defeat them, because noone has a strong enough immune system left medicine is ruining humanity. My view applies to pretty much every genetic encoded selfdefense mechanism. For example the ability to detect cancer. My view basicly is that medicine allows humans to survive who would normally die due to natural selection. And they are able to reproduce resulting in a weaker gen-pool than the generation before. I am not racists or have anything against disabled, gays or other minorities.
