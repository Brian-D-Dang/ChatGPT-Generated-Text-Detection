In my opinion happiness is simply the comfort of knowing that bad things are not happening to you, or bad things are happening to other people and not you. The knowledge that one is avoiding such misfortunes while others must suffer through them creates the sensation of happiness. Bearing this in mind, it is only logical that happiness cannot exist without sadness. I think this notion applies to any scale of human life: No one is truly happy unless they have been exposed to or experience misfortune. This leads me to believe that there will always have to be someone who is sad for there to be someone who is happy. Points of contention: - Happiness is simply the result of the avoidance or overcoming of misfortune. - In order for happiness to exist, there must be sadness. - Therefore, there must always be sad people for anyone to be happy. I would like to discuss this topic because it seems very pessimistic in my mind. I strive toward optimism in my life, but this belief suggests that a perfect world is impossible, which seems a bit sad. Maybe it is impossible, but I'd still love thoughts.
