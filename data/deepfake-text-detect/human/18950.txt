[Look at this map] See the countries in magentapurple colours? Most of those countries have a domestic population that is steadily declining and has been for a few decades now. The birth rate in most of those countries is below the necessary 2.1 children per woman. Population decline on this level is detrimental to the economy, which the politicians understand and because of that they try to combat it through financial incentives but also by a much more open immigration policy from third world countries because its one of the least costly remedies. Nothing wrong with that - the future lies in connecting the world, not isolating. I also understand most people immigrate in hopes of a better life for themselves and their family. I sympathize with that. However, does this not mean that the ethnic composition will be vastly different in let's say 100 years from now if the population loss is being compensatedrecouped through immigration from Africa and the Middle East (unstable regions with the largest population growth) but also from countries of the world where the economy is on its knees (the current greek brain drain as an example)?
