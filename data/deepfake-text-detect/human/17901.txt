They call themselves a circlejerk but we all know they don't see themselves that way. Despite claims to ideological legitimacy, they are one of the most exclusive and ban-happy communities on Reddit, silencing users often for nothing more than their differing views. A community that refuses to hear opinions it disagrees with perpetuates its own closed-mindedness and ignorance. You can't refuse to listen to others and wonder why they don't take you seriously. If the Fempire really wanted to spread its message it would put the banhammer away and engage in actual discourse with those who challenge it.
