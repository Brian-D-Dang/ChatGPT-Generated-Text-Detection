This is a joke. A newbie initiation pisstake ceremony of sorts. I'm half expecting several coworkers to jump out at me. They started setting it up as soon as I got the job. 'Come and look at this' Janice had said opening a filing cabinet.'Who would want to send a letter to someone not even born yet?' Showing me the yellowing envelope.'The dates coming up soon too.' It does look old. They probably reuse this prank on all the staff. I check the time. I'm early, but no one else in sight. Maybe that's the joke, nothing happens. I look up from my watch and there is a car there. I get out,'Marty?'
