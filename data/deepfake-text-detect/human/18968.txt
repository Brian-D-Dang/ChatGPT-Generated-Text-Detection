I understand that hunting is important for wildlife population control and, for some, a means of sustenance. I have no problem with this nor do I have a problem with using modern technology (rifles, traps, trail cams, etc.) to make these hunts more efficient. However, some hunts are purely for recreation and trophies. I take issue with this. I think it's wrong and unsporting to kill animals that have no real chance of fleeing or defending themselves. There is no "thrill of the hunt" in shooting a lion from several meters in an armored jeep. If a human wants to hunt for sport, there should be a real chance of failure or injury in taking trophies. Neanderthals did not have throwing spears, only thrusting spears. This meant that they had to get very close to their quarry when hunting. As you can imagine, they were frequently trampled and gored by large animals. In my opinion, this is the most fair way to hunt and shows due respect to the quarry. If done at all, this is how sport hunting should be done. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
