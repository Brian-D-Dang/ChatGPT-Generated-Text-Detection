"Thank you for coming Mrs. Johnson," the principal said firmly. "James has caused quite the stir on our campus." "Thank you for calling me here, Principal Andrews," Mrs. Johnson said as she cast an angry glance toward her son in the chair beside her. "I understand James was involved in a fight in school today?" "Unfortunately, yes," the principal said as he folded his hands on the desk before him. "Not only was he involved, he was the perpetrator of an unprovoked attack on one of our new foreign exchange students." "But I don't understand," Mrs. Johnson started, "James has always been mild mannered, he would never do something like that." "That's why I am only suspending him," the principal said as he glared at the boy. "I hope you understand what you could have done to this school's reputation." James's only response was a blank stare back into the authoritative eyes of the principal "James," he continued, "our school takes its foreign exchange student program very seriously. An unprovoked attack on a student, regardless if he is an exchange student or not, is completely absurd. Why on earth would you do something like that?" James drew in a staggered breath. It was obvious he was frightened, but showing that fear to the principal was not an option. He paused for a moment before uttering one phrase, "He was a 10, Mr. Andrews."
