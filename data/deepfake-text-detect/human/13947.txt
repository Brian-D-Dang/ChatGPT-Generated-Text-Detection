Timmy was excited that his brothers had all gone to school. That meant his mother would be able to play with Timmy. His mother came to Timmy and asked what he wanted to do. Timmy brought out his lego set and they played together for hours. Timmy could not wait until tomorrow, when playtime would reoccur.
