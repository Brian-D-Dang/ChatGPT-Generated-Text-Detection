I'm not going to take the risk of an innocent kid inheriting my bad decisions and crappy life. "Success stories" where a kid born in a trailer works to become a millionaire are rare and unrealistic. I'm not going to gamble that my child might have a good life. Poverty is shown to be connected with poor nutrition, prejudice and bigotry, and a culture of ignorance. I feel sorry for my high school graduating classes kids, popping out a half dozen before the time they're 30. Not one of those poor kids has a shot at a good life, and they're all too unaware to see it. Wasted lives from the get go. Source: I'm poor in a small hick town, working to leave.
