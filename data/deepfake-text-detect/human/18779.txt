I seem to be in the minority among the people I've talked to about this issue and I can't figure out why. I believe that this issue is unimportant to our overall political discourse and doesn't warrant the amount of national media attention it is getting. I think that when there are nearly 17,000 murders every year, 11,000 of which are gun-related [ (Source) ] that this case is no more or less important than any other murder case. Rather than talking about this specific case, which I believe is only used to evoke fear and anger from the American population, we should be having a larger conversation about our astronomical murder rate and how we can defeat the culture of murder. Please CMV and tell me why this case is important to American politics.
