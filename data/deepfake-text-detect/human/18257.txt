I think that the friend zone as men commonly complain about is a one sided relationship in favor of the woman, and is outright exploitation of the man. Consequently that is why seems so inescapable. Here is why. The man expresses romantic interest in the woman, and she says that she would rather just be friends. On its face it is immediately unfair, because one person is getting what she wants, and the other person is not. My other issue with the friend zone is that it is not a true friendship. In fact it is a completely uneven exchange in favor of the woman. The man is expected to be available for whatever the woman has in mind as she strings him along, knowing fully well that he hopes that she will one day change her opinion of him. When single she will use him to fulfill the platonic functions of a boy friend while she seeks sexual, and romantic fulfillment from some one else. On the other hand if the man wants to solicit his female friend to spend some time with him to do what he enjoys then she will almost universally decline, and pursue her other priorities. I think that this leads to great frustration for the men, because they feel trapped by the conundrum of being a nice guy: a nice guy will be willing to be a good friend, but they are frustrated by how one sided the relationship is without understanding why. On the other hand the females may, or may not be totally aware of what they are doing, and do so without remorse. Either way they know that they have a relationship where they are gotten what they want, and he is not, and feel that that is acceptable behavior. Once again, I think that the friend zone is outright exploitation of nice guys, and their efforts at being nice, and or pursuing a traditional courtship. Given that these women have been rewarded with a giving relationship requiring no sacrifice on their part it is no wonder that they never let these men escape from the friend zone. Change my view.
