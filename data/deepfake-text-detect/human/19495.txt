If someone is asking for a source to a claim, and someone links the Let Me Google That For You, I consider them to be passive aggressive. Many times they use the excuse that it is "common knowledge" and "easy to google', however, if it's so easy, it should be even easier to ACTUALLY just google it and provide a link directly to the article. I've seen this A LOT on reddit. People actually insulting and attacking someone, simply for asking for a source. This just seems retarded too me. I ENCOURAGE people to use critical thinking skills, being skeptical, and most importantly to not accept things at face value and to ask for sources for claims they don't think are true, and I feel like a lot of this is BECAUSE of reddit. Many things are posted here, some true and some not so much...but I feel this is more ranting so I guess I'll go back to the tile...anyone who uses Let Me Google That For You links are being passive aggressive.
