"ATTENTION OCCUPANTS." The people in the elevator shuffled in place, confused. One man pushed the "open door" button without success. Faces turned upwards, trying to locate the source of the voice. "THIS ELEVATOR WILL RESUME NORMAL FUNCTION UPON SATISFACTION OF OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS." An older gentleman, wearing a tweed jacket and holding a worn leather briefcase, cleared his throat. "What operational parameters?" "ONLY ONE OCCUPANT MAY LIVE." The people gasped. One woman fainted, knocking her head against the wall as she fell. A young boy grinned. "One down, I guess," said the boy. "NEGATORY, OCCUPANT. SHE IS MERELY INCAPACITATED." "Oh." The boy's shoulders slumped. The older gentleman looked around at the others in the crowd. "Well, this is quite awkward. Perhaps we should wait for rescue?" The others nodded. A woman in a purple pantsuit raised her hand. "We'll have to, I'm afraid." She grimaced. "Sorry to say, but I'm actually an immortal angel and can not be killed by any normal means." The crowd groaned. "I'm immortal, too," mumbled the young boy. "An ancient wizard cursed me to remain this way forever, no matter what. Only his death can release me." "Did you hear, elevator?" asked the older gentleman. "We've got two immortals here - " "Three, actually," said a voice from the back. "I was given supernatural healing powers, I can't be killed before my body heals itself." The voice paused. "Sorry for the inconvenience." "Is there anyone here who isn't immortal?" asked the woman in the pantsuit. The others looked around in silence. She looked at the older gentleman, "You?" "Not immortal, no, just psychically-linked with the endless plane of the Infinity Zone," he replied. "Sadly, none of you can kill me, that's for sure. Not so long as I retain my psychic link. Which can't be broken." The woman in the pantsuit turned to a short Mexican woman clutching a small dog. "What about you? Don't tell me that you're immortal too." "No, senorita," replied the Mexican woman, "but Felipe here" - she held up her dog - " is visiting from the planet Canus Permanentus, where his reign has lasted for millennia." The dog barked. "He can not be harmed by human means." The woman in the pantsuit sighed. "Elevator, does the dog count?" she asked. "AFFIRMATIVE, OCCUPANT." "Oh great," she grumbled. "The dog counts." "Well, you might as well resume normal operations, elevator," suggested the older gentleman. "We can't be killed." "THIS ELEVATOR WILL RESUME NORMAL FUNCTION UPON SATISFACTION OF OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS." The crowd groaned again. "Uh, excuse me, Mr. Elevator?" asked the Mexican woman. "I was on my way to take Felipe on a walk. If we do not hurry, he is going to pee on the floor." "He can't do that!" protested the woman in the pantsuit. "I refuse to stand in dog piss." "Actually," chimed the older gentleman, "if we don't get moving, I may also contribute to this elevator's collection of organic waste material." "English, please," complained the young boy. "I'm going to shit on the floor," clarified the older gentleman. "Me too!" said the voice from the back. The crowd waited for the elevator's response. "YOUR TERMS ARE ACCEPTABLE. OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS HAVE BEEN SHIFTED. PROCEEDING TO MAIN LOBBY." The crowd cheered as the elevator resumed its descent. "Aww," complained the voice in the back.
