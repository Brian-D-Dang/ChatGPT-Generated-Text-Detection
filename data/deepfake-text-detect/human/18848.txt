I obviously have a bit of a libertarian streak. Also, it's worth noting that I wear a seatbelt 100 of the time I am in a car, and always have. That out of the way, I feel that forcing people to engage in an activity which at face value only serves to protect them from themselves is overstepping reasonable government regulation. Adults should be allowed to increase their risk of injury or death so long as it does not increase that risk for any other persons. I've had talks with people about my take on this IRL and have had some pretty interesting discussions. People generally point to higher road fatalities causing taxpayers money due to costs of first responders as ways in which driving without a seatbelt hurts others, but I personally consider this negligible as there are many small actions in all facets of life that on aggregate could cost taxpayers money. I really see no good reason why private individuals should be forced by law to engage in a safety measure which is 99.9 personal safety. CMV!
