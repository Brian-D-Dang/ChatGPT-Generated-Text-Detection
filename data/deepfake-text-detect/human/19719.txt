[This] post about Utilitarianism had some interesting discussion in it, so I thought it would be interesting to come at it from a different angle. I haven't studied much philosophy, but I consider myself basically a Kantian; that is, I think actions are moral in and of themselves, and not because of the consequences. For example, to a Utilitarian, cheating on my wife is bad because of the possibility of her finding out and feeling betrayed. To a Kantian, it doesn't matter how perfectly I plan my crime, it doesn't matter if my wife never finds out; I have still committed an immoral action. This seems intuitively like a more moral system, but I've learned that intuition is often a bad way to go about things, so I want you to change my view.
