I just want to say,first-off, that I liked Pacific Rim, it was fun and action-packed. But it was average (and yes, I like a lot average or worse movies). I feel like (and I may be wrong about this) there was a ridiculous amount of hype on reddit and the internet at-large about this movie. How it would be the anti-transformers. How it would be totally different from other action movies. How Del Toro would be the one to do it best. I just didn't get this from the movie, I am hoping that I am very wrong, and that I missed something in the plot or in the movie. I am ready to admit that I did, if that is the case. The movie was average. Big robots fighting against godzilla's cousins. And not very much robot fighting at that. Two awesome-looking robots got introduced and talked up, but then lasted on the battlefield about as long as it took to introduce them. Seriously? You're not gonna show me some cool move that the three-armed robot can do?? Also the plot-holes galore, the miserable back story, and the no-reason martyrdom at the end? Average. On the same level as Transformers. But if I'm wrong, tell me why. Thanks folks. EDIT: I also forgot to add that, even though I LOVE Idris Elba, I felt like his ridiculous one-liners brought the movie down. EDIT 2: Alright folks, just got home from school and I will start working on responding. Thanks for all of the great responses so far.
