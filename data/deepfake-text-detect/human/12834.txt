Awake. That dream. That same dream. Bombs falling. The smell of death and fear in the air everywhere. People crying out for help. The same dream I have had every night since the war started five or six years ago. It's easy to forget. Especially when you want to. Sweat. I wipe it off my forehead throw my blanket off and walk towards the corner of our underground tin-can that we designated as the kitchen. There are so many boxes piled up. It looks like we moved in yesterday. But it definitely doesn't feel that way. An open box. Water. We have plenty but I still drink it like it's the last time I'll ever see it. Warm. Cold water is a luxury we no longer have. Not that having it would make me happy. Wires. They lead to the desk leaning against the dull-colored wall opposite of the kitchen. I follow. That noise. It's a sort of bubbly ringing noise. I know it all too well. It has been so long. I sit down at the desk and promptly answer. A voice. "Hey dude, my seven day CS: GO ban is finally over! We can play some more comp!" And a response. "Fuck yeah dude, I was getting so bored! Let's rape some noobs!" Life inside the shelter isn't bad, especially considering that the United States is still providing internet. But for the past seven days it was hell.
