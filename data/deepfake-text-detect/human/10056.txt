Voting without paying taxes is a conflict of interest. Why should I get a say in how something that I don't pay for is run? I could just vote myself more and more money without bearing any of the expense. I lost my job last month and I'm on unemployment. Why should I get a say in how much money I get when I am living off the work of others? This is just like when you are a child. You don't get to make the rules because you aren't paying the rent, and you don't get to set your allowance. Money is a medium of exchange it is received when you provide a good or service of value to someone, and spent when you take a good or service of value from someone else. Therefore the more wealth you accumulate, the more net value you have provided to society. These people should have more of a say in how our society is run because they have given it the most. Also this would be for the best since rich people are generally smarter and more competent than poor people, and would choose better politicians that don't just appeal to emotion.
