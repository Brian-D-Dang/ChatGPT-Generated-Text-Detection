Material: wool may be scratchier than cotton. Egyptian Cotton is cotton with a longer staple, which means a longer thread can be woven from one piece, which means there is less inconsistency in the thread yielding a smoother and softer feel. Sheets utilizing plant material are all rayon or some special process yielding rayon. They can be pretty comfy. I have a set and I like them. I also have a set of linen sheets that are pretty sweet. -Thread count: a super fine wool is just as comfy as cotton. A higher thread count means finer threads in the fabric. There is a point of diminishing returns. -Weave: certain weaves can be softer than others at the expense of durability. You'll often see "sateen" sheets. This refers to a weave style that is generally less durable than others but makes for a softer and smoother feeling product. The alternative is a plain weave which is more durable, though not on a scale of any particular relevance for sheets (YMMV). Practically you WILL notice a different between 250 and 400 thread count sheets, you will probably notice it between 400 and 600, but anything beyond that is kind of irrelevant. You will notice a difference between sateen and plain weaves or percale. If you want a sheet that's nice and will last forever at a fair price, find some 400-600 thread count cotton sheets that are either plain weave or percale. Percale makes for a lighter but stiffer feeling sheet. The various rayon sheets are pretty alright too. Linen sheets are also pretty awesome if you live somewhere hot and humid.','Thread count is basically a measurement of coursness a high thread count has lots of tiny threads woven together making a smoother fabric.
