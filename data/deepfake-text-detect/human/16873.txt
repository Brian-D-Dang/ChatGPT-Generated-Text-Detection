Time-harmonic far-field source array imaging in a two-dimensional waveguide is analyzed. A low-frequency situation is considered in which the diameter of the waveguide is slightly larger than the wavelength, so that the waveguide supports a limited number of guided modes, and the diameter of the antenna array is smaller than the wavelength, so that the standard resolution formulas in open media predict very poor imaging resolution. A general framework to analyze the resolution and stability performances of such antenna arrays is introduced. It is shown that planar antenna arrays perform better (in terms of resolution and stability with respect to measurement noise) than linear (horizontal or vertical) arrays and that vertical linear arrays perform better than horizontal arrays, for a given diameter. However a fundamental limitation to imaging in waveguides is identified that is due to the form of the dispersion relation. It is intrinsic to scalar waves, whatever the complexity of the medium and the array geometry.
