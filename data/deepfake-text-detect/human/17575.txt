It's clear that politicians are more interested in sticking to party lines than using common sense these days. And it doesn't take a genius to realize that there is a vast array of differing opinions. Two parties simply cannot cater to everyone. So why do we only have 2 parties. Why does everyone else fall under the "Independent" classification? In reality, very few people are truly democrats or republicans. I would hope that our country is a little more heterogeneous than that. [Look] how many political parties South Africa has. More importantly though, look how many are represented in Parliament. Sure there's a ruling majority, but a wide variety of opinions are at least represented. EDIT: Okay, I think you guys have changed my view. I can't point to only one comment, but really 3 specific ones from uSwiftyLeZar, uhealthsquirrel, and upompandpride. Two of which offered real-world examples and explained how a multi-party system functions in reality. It's clear to me that I had an idealized vision of the multi-party system and I now see that in practice it doesn't really work like I envisioned it. It seems the issues I have with the two-party system are really just issues with government as a whole and they happen regardless of how many parties exist.
