This CMV was sparked by the reaction to Donald Trump from the right in the recent GOP Candidate Debate but extends to everyone who intentionally used political incorrectness for personal or political gain. Donald Trump, who was once considered a joke candidate is now leading most polls for the GOP nomination, mostly due to his unapologetic opinions about things and his willingness to be open about his policies and ideas. He has also said that "I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct," and to some extent I agree; political correctness has gone too far in this country and people need to be less offended by things. However, he has used "political incorrectness" as an excuse for his awful behavior and comments such as the mexican rapists invading our border and how Rosie O'Donell is a "fat slob" and instead of facing criticism for his opinions is being championed as some sort of visionary for people who's opinions don't align with the mainstream instead of the jackass that he is. Edit: Thanks everyone for all the answers! I'm sorry I couldn't reply to you all but some excellent points were brought up and good debates were had. Hello, users of CMV!
