I've lived practically my whole life on this phrase. It has shaped how I have made several important decisions in my life, though I have recently come to suspect that this may not be the whole truth. The phrase itself is fairly explanatory, but the deeper meaning behind it is that you should always be looking for some kind of satisfaction behind your work; Be it a happy customer, or a well-stocked shelf, or a cool painting. There is always something in your work that can grant you at least some menial satisfaction, but if there is not even that much then the work you are doing is not fit for doing.
