We called in the order, but had to pick it up two doors down and pay for it there as well. The lady on the phone said they didn't have green peppers and asked if yellow was ok. We said yes. We got yellow, red and green peppers but no pepperoni, like we asked. And the other cheese pizza was burnt on the bottom. Plus she only gave us three papers plates with two large pizzas!?! Will not return.
