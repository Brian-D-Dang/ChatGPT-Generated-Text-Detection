is it just too complicated to adjust the manufacturing process Not really, just doesn't make any sense since the grand majority are fine with only one size. Most likely wouldn't justify the increased production costs.,in economy you have something like a "Batch" or a "batch size" as well as "changeover cost" and, naturally, "inventory cost." There are many different ways to balance out those factors [this one is an easy and popular one] (URL0). but essentially the idea is that in order to produce bigger mice, you need to changeover your machines and produce atleast amount x to make it worth the changerover cost, but at the same time you have to make sure not to produce too much, else the inventory cost get too high and it was not worth it either (in comparassion to just letting the machine run or do some other mice instead). This is very simplified but I hope you get the idea and problem, if you decide to produce niche products without extraordinary costs (for the consumer).
