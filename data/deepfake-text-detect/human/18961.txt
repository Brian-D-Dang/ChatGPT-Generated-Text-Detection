Swear words are a natural part of human language, and we shouldn't be intellectually shamed for accessing powerful language in order to convey powerful emotions. Even if we're not trying to convey powerful emotions, swear words contain meaning just like any other more socially acceptable word. A person is not necessarily less articulate by using swear words. I think people who are offended by swear words are afraid of being accused of having childish sensitivities, so claiming the person is inarticulate is their way of not having to listen to swearing by taking a "grown-up" intellectual stance. The principle of least effort dictates that people will generally attempt to convey an idea in as few words as possible. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, and people don't have anything to lose by doing so. CMV. Sorry if this is too long. A bot said my original post was too short.
