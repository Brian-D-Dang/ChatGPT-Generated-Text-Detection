Ferny always wanted to travel to an isolated island somewhere. He had planned an extensive trip for him and his wife. They rented a boat and sailed off in the sunset hoping for adventure. They got much more when they got caught in a storm and had to abort. They swam and made it to an isolated island with no one around.
