Hello my lost twin, separated by the process of physical birth. I miss you. There are scars inside of me. My spirit sleeps to dream of you. But when you are near, it's like two south sides of a magnet, they can't get closer. So hello from far away, please stay over there. Stay away from me. I crave you. I want to smell and taste you. But this is no paradise. We can't play together now. Not until we die. Then we will be home, one, again. Forever. Edit: I feel like I could go with this if I was home.
