The striker is available to play for Exeter in their League Two game at Accrington on Friday night. Morrison began his career at Palace in 1997 and scored 71 goals in 181 games before moving to Birmingham City for club-record fee of PS4.25m in 2002. After three seasons at St Andrews he returned to Palace for PS2m before moving to Coventry City in 2008. He spent two seasons at the Ricoh Arena before moving on to Sheffield Wednesday, and after loans at MK Dons and Brentford, joined Colchester in 2012.
