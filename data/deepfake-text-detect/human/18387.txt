Disclaimer: I am not talking about feminism specifically, although it was the one to motivate my post, and rather am looking to discuss the general phenomenon. Thus, my views on religion, feminism etc. are irrelevant and I will try my best not to preach or anything similar. I was motivated by [this] rAdviceAnimals thread to discuss this here. Whenever those kinds of posts arise, people's first reaction is to say "if they think like that, they're not real ideology." My problem with this is that, when a movement or such gets to such a large and, specially, decentralized state, one can no longer say what the movement's beliefs are "for real." Each person has their own understanding of the movement and thus you have many different views of the same thing coexisting. While in a smaller scale you might be able to coordinate everyone into understanding that, despite individual nuances, the movement is really about something specific without the need of an authority figure, when it comes to the hundreds of thousands of people or more, this becomes utterly impossible. This also translates to a wider variety of views and larger discrepancies inside the same ideology, for people's nuances in beliefs tend to vary more. The decentralization of the movement aggravates this, as there is no one true source to refer to when questioned about what the movement is really about. Thus, I believe every attempt to dismiss certain ways of thinking as unimportant based on the argument that those beliefs don't really represent the ideology can be categorized as a No true Scotsman" Fallacy] . Also, any attempt to maintain the name of the movement and its history while defining right ways to think within it are fallacies as well, because they ultimately fall into the same situation as before.
