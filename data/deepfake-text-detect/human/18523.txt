1. Java is, "Write once, run anywhere!" 2. It has curly braces and semicolons. I don't have to count spacestabs, and I don't have to worry about the whitespace getting mangled somewhere along the line. Neither does it suffer paranthesitis, a swelling of the parantheses, often accompanied by Polish notation. 3. It doesn't have implicits or other fancy syntactic sugar. The code does what it says. I don't have to worry about some magical invisible method being called, and I don't have to leave it up to the compiler to know the type of my variables because, really, I should know. 4. It doesn't do duck typing. Sorry, Rubyists, but if you hand me a kilogram of ground chuck instead of pounds of sirloin, don't hold your hands out and tell me, "If it quacks like a duck...." I want to brown the sirloin, not the chuck! 5. I can safely ignore talk of monoidal functors. 6. I've got the enterprise backing me rather than a few open-source projects. 7. I can hire random replacement resources (r3) off the street. 8. Verbosity is a feature. It forces us to think about things more and simplify. If you can use random higher-order functions and pass functional literals around, it all seems too easy, so you do it. Java makes the equivalent harder, so if you can do without, you just might. 9. It can run in the browser. Java applets were HTML5 before there was HTML5. 10. Duke is still cool.
