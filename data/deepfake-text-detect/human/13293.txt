It was called the Gaming Forum. 64 competitors from 64 nations fought to the death to secure the crown. And for ten years, WarLizard won the tournament. At the end of his ten year run, he was set free. To ensure the secrecy of the forum, a section of his memory was swapped with some random slob who had the misfortune of being physically similar from his hometown. Rumors spread of the secret tournament. Some people wanted him back - either to secure the crown for their country, or secure their bets against others. "Are you Warlizard, from that one gaming forum?" Everyday - every post. The call grew. "How do you not remember about the Gaming Forum? Maybe THIS will help you remember." Warlizard scratched his chin pensively - in awe of the video playing before him. A man - himself infact - was standing in front of another kneeling person. Warlizard's hand grasped tightly on their skull. With a swift motion, the skull and spine were removed from the kneeling body. The crowd shouted "FATALITY." A blue link below the video - click. It read: KUMITE 2015. GATHER AT THE GAMING FORUM FOR THE RETURN OF THE KING. Warlizard recoiled. His picture was staring back at him from the monitor. A loud knock on the door. Warlizard turned in his chair, preparing to embrace his destiny.
