I'm just following up on my previous review. Through the recommendation of my new Vet, I did opt to have an ultra sound (more detailed and less invasive, procedure than biopsy) performed, and discovered the dog had a sever infection of the prostate. The prostate had enlarged to twice the normal size. The infection was actually located on the outside of the prostate and could have spread and possibly killed the dog. I'm glad I didn't take Dr. Anderson's advice not to perform the biopsy (or similar test). It took immediate surgery and three weeks of antibiotics, but my dog it doing much better. The cost was less than I had expected. I'm glad I didn't waste any more time waiting for Dr. Anderson to return my phone calls and recommend treatment. I feel stupid for even waiting that long, but like many people noted on their reviews they trust Dr. Anderson. I was no different, so I waited. I'm happy with my new vet, but sadly disappointed in my previous one.
