My last night in Vegas on memorial day weekend I headed here with Tiny (Luke) and had a blast. Charles the bartender who made it clear that he only works Mondays and Tuesdays (he is sooooooooo cute...) treated us with such care that I am planning a trip back in July just to go say hi. Overall drinks were poured generously and the clientele was entertaining. Of course by the time we ordered our 3rd cocktail we were getting close to missing our flight and had to slam it and run back to our hotel to pick up our luggage. Unfortunately I didn't get to see the whole Flex scene but hopefully next time. Would I go back....oh hells yeah...
