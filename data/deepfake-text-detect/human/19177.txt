For reference, I'm thinking more sibling-sibling incest (Jaime-Cersei) as opposed to parent child, since the latter has a fucked-up power dynamic. So I understand, biologically, why incest is bad, and I have the same knee-jerk reaction to it, but I don't see why it should be illegal for two consenting, related adults to have a romantic sexual relationship. This comparison is going to get me a lot of shit, but here goes: many people were against gay marriage homosexual relationships because they found them disgusting. Over time, though, the prevailing attitude changed for the better towards tolerance. Why should our gut reaction towards incest carry any more moral weight than that of homophobes? Shouldn't we just be tolerant? EDIT: For those bringing out the "think of the children" argument: Should two people who knowingly carry the gene for a genetic disorder like sickle-cell disease be allowed to have a sexual relationship? What's the relevant difference? What if they oppose abortions and are determined to have kids the natural way (no IVF genetic screening)?
