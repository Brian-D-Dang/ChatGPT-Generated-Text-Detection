From every account I've read, CeCe McDonald 1. was defending herself from someone that hadnt physically attacked her 2. Pulled a weapon from her bag 3. stabbed the other guy in the chest with it 4. told him she had stabbed him 5. told the police she had stabbed him 6. changed her mind afterwards And suddenly it seems she's a hero for no reason other than the fact that she's trans. Every post I can find on reddit seems to be talking about hate crimes against trans people and how courageous and intelligent and wonderful they are, and I'm not disputing any of that. But if I walked up to a black man and shouted "nigger" at him and he proceeded to pull out a gun and shoot me, would he be acquitted? I hardly think so. CeCe's conviction for second degree murder (wilful but not premeditated) seems to me to fit the bill perfectly here. I know there's a bigger question about cruel and unusual punishment from putting trans women in male prisons, and i'd prefer to steer clear of that if i may. I'm more interested to hear anyone actually justifying her actions as self defence on the night in question. Orrrrrrr am i just a big bigot:D EDIT: Easy on the attacks there people, i came here to have a view that there was blind, logic-lacking support going on and that emotion was dominating reason. The insults are doing the exact opposite.
