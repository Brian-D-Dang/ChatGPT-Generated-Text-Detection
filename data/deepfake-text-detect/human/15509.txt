Poor service at this location- we reserved a full size but they didn't have one. Luckily for them, someone had altered our res to a midsize, which they had. We had our confirmation but were told we could have changed our res after printing; essentially calling us liars. I almost got into it with two employees who acted like they were doing us a favor by giving us a car our baby seat could barely fit into. Wow, that was a terrible experience.
