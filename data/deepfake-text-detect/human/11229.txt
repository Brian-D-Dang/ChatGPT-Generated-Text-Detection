A team of researchers have genetically modified jellyfish so that their neurons light up when activated. This allowed them to watch the animal's neural activity as it behaved naturally. Jellyfish have brains diffused across their bodies like a net, with each part able to operate autonomously. By observing jellyfish neurons in real-time, the scientists determined that while the network of neurons seems unstructured, there is a surprising degree of organization. The level of neural organization is invisible under a microscope and can only be seen by visualizing active neurons. A couple of short clips showing jellyfish neurons lighting up are available in the article.
