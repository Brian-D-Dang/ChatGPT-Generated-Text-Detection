I come here about twice a month since I work a couple miles from here. The place is nice, and although the hostess looks as though she is irritated all the time, the servers are nice and friendly. This place has a great atmosphere with a decent bar and multiple television shows playing whatever. The salad they serve is AWESOME. I myself am extremely picky on my salads, but I can eat theirs anytime. I always buy the little combo meals with come with 5 different selections (eg: Orange Chicken) and some type of sushi.... for 6.99! I will say the portion of your selection is rather on the small side, but the sushi roll seems just list any other. The taste is good, the food is fresh, all around this is one place you should try.
