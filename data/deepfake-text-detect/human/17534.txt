Our national dialogue when it comes to teen pregnancy and abortion is always focused on the mother. I have never in my life heard a real, substantive, worthwhile discussion on the use of condoms in our society. It seems to me it's much easier for a guy to put on a condom right before sex, than for a girl to take a pill every single day of the month, making sure she refills it on time so it doesn't disrupt her cycle. I realize both consenting adults are responsible for the results of their actions, but I don't see why females contraception is the focus of every news report surrounding teen pregnancy, but fathers get a free pass.
