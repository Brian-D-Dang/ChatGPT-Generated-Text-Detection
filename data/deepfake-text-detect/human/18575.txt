I have been told our military defends us every second of every day, but as far as I can tell as a nation our freedom has never been under direct or credible indirect threat from foreign or domestic combattants. Our foreign policy is what puts us in danger of attack and our abusive foreign policy is largely driven by our confidence in our large military. The only credible argument made is for World War II... which was largely drafted, and I have never seen any credible claim that the US was in any direct danger from occupation (and even being attacked was due to our own involvement in the war by supplying arms). Also (currently) I reject the revolutionary war (which I will accept as being done by the "US Military, because it would assume that today Canada, Australia, etc. are not "free." We had plenty of freedoms as a colony, and we went to war to protect the interests of the wealthy. As far as I can tell those are the only two wars even worth arguing about.... but please CMW.:) (For Scope: I don't consider protecting economic interests as defending our freedom but am willing to hear arguments for it.)
