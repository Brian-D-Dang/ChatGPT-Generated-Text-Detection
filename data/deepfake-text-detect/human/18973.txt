I've long had this belief that remembering someone's birthday by actually knowing it, not through Facebook, or some other calendar reminder, is more worthwhile. As such, I've given to telling anyone I meet (if they ask) my birthday only once. No hints or reminders, unless they actually care and aren't just asking for the sake of asking. To me it's a way to differentiate between friends and acquaintances. I really don't have anything to gain from this other than that - I don't really care about gifts, birthday wishes, or the like. What counts for me is that someone remembered of their own accord, and took their time to wish me a happy birthday. Reddit, am I wrong in doing this? I've been told that I should let others know when my birthday is so that I can get birthday wishes...but those wishes - to me - seem empty, on the grounds that they wouldn't have remembered my birthday had it not been for a reminder. But I've also been told that some people mean their well wishes, but simply can't remember things. My view is that if people back before the Information Age with all the smart phones and internet could remember important things (e.g. meetings, interviews, or in my case, birthdays) then humanity can still do so. I've struggled with this view for far too many years. Family, friends and schoolmates have taken stances on either sides of the argument so I haven't been able to decide which is better. Change my view, Reddit?
