With all the Quinnspiracy and GamerGate bullshit going on, I've come to the conclusion that gaming community of reddit is full of misogynistic neckbeards who are unable to take any critique. This is proven by the popularity of rKotakuinaction, a subreddit brigading and attacking (even making death threats) anyone who disagrees with them. It also has a huge overlap of users with rTheRedPill and rMensrights. Those two subreddits promote inequality and sometimes even violence against the opposite gender. Other major gaming subreddits like rgames and rgaming have also had multiple highly upvoted posts about supporting Gamergate. Another evidence about this is the hatred towards a popular feminist and critic Anita Sarkeesian. If you go to any gaming subreddit you are gonna find out that mot people absolutely despise her. Reason? She's a feminist and is complaining about the portraying of female characters in many video games. GamerGate is a movement that is apparently aiming to expose and combat the corruption in video games industry. On paper it sounds like a worthy goal but in reality it is mostly complaining about feminist gamersgaming critics and attacking anyone who disagrees with them. (See the death threats I mentioned. Even I have recieved some hate messages for disagreeing with them. This is all hurting the image of Reddit. There have already been articles in many large newspapers about the death threats made to Sarkeesian and the GamerGate.
