You've all heard or experienced going to a coffee shop, ordering your drink and finding out the person ahead of you has paid for your drink. Then the cashier says "This has been going on for 30 customers so far!" You then normally "Pay-it-forward" for the person after you since you don't want to be an asshole and break the chain. My question is this: What is the purpose of keeping the chain going if everyone is basically paying the same amount of money or more than they would just by paying for their own order? How is that generous?
