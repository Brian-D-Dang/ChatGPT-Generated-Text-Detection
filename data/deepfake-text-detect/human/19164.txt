DISCLAIMER: I am not a conspiracy theorist I am not a libertarian I have no especially strong anti-Fed political views Any arguments based around any of these things I will regard highly suspiciously I confess myself largely ignorant of economics and am looking for informed arguments to refine my initial impressions My Current View: The Fed has as part of its stated purposes the dual mandate of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices which it achieves via monetary policy I believe the second half of that mandate (price stabilization) is largely achievable via monetary policy. The correlation between money supply and prices is evident and the goal is laudable as inflation hurts savers and deflation hurts investors. I believe that the first half of that mandate (maximum employment) is far more difficult to achieve via monetary policy today for various reasons (automation, education, structural unemployment), and that monetary policy as a tool of maximizing employment has always had dubious efficacy, especially compared to the other half of the mandate. Employment maximization could be much more easily achieved via legislative measures. The Fed's concerns over the past decade or two have been far more weighted (almost exclusively) towards unemployment at the expense of price stabilization The Fed could therefore have done far more good for the American people had it focused on price stabilization and left unemployment concerns to the legislature Edit: Delta has been awarded Hello, users of CMV!
