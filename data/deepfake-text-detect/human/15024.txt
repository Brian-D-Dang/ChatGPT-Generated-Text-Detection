Awesome. This place has awesome BBQ. It's really busy all the time so I recommend getting there early. The portions are way to big but you get to try everything. The pimento cheese fries rock and you don't need the meat on them unless you want to into a food coma before dinner. I was surprised that the brisket was so well cooked. They obviously take their time making it because it's really tender. They have a large beer selection supporting the local Charlotte breweries among others. Service was fast and they have a knowledgeable wait staff. I also have ordered their bulk to-go food for parties and was not disappointed except for the kitchen manager who was kind of a jerk on the phone.
