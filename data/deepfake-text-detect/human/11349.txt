Full Self-Driving on Tesla vehicles works for highway driving, but when it comes to inner-city streets, it still has some ways to go. The most recent update shows that more and more aspects of city driving are becoming recognized by the company's neural networks. A small clip is available showing a Model 3 rendering details, such as directional lights, on a stop light signal. Elon Musk recently said in a tweet that the release of Tesla's Full Self-Driving functionalities is still looking good for this year.
