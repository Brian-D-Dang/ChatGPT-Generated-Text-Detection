"Dear Citizens of Earth," The Man's voice crackled through the static of every TV on the planet. "My name is Bartholomeus Veron. You may not know me, but I know you. Yes you, each and every one of you. I have seen what you, what we, as a whole, can accomplish. I have gazed upon the apex of our success, and I was content. But a lot of time has passed since we have reached our peak. We have become divided. We fight in petty squabbles and kill each other over strips of dirt or the ideas in our heads. I will put a stop to this. I can't, as a human being, stand by and watch how we tear ourselves apart. Thousands of years of progress will not die in the atomic fires of juvenile men playing god. My goal is to save humanity. From each other, from ourselves, I will save us! Save us ALL! To save humanity, I must enslave it, to force our greatest strenght out I must kill us and rebirth us into our next step! My name is Bartholomeus Veron. You will bow to my dominion or be crushed beneath my heels."
