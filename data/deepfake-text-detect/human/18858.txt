Fact: It is widely accepted that the Universe must have a beginning. Claim: Intelligent Design and the Big Bang theory explain this phenomenon with the same basic foundation. ID says: There is some intelligent being who exists outside of our understanding of time. He has no beginning and no end. He created the Universe. BB says: At some moment, all matter in the universe was contained in one single point. The Big Bang took place causing this matter to expand and marked the beginning of the Universe. This matter must have always existed, because based on the laws of science matter cannot be created. In other words, all matter in the universe must have no beginning and no end. Either you believe in an intelligent being who has no beginning and no end, or you believe in matter that has no beginning and no end. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
