First off, this is from a north american view. I'm not talking about anywhere except north america Now, i am an MRA. And while some of the thing's posted on rMensRights isn't that important, reading through the articles, seeing the injustices done by society to men, it's difficult to see how some would be against it. Now, the MRA hasn't (to my knowledge) ever said that men's issues are more important than women's. I'm not saying that women don't face injustices of their own. But to deny half of the population a way to fix those problem's simply because they have different genital's is sexist. I don't think Feminism cares about the right's of men. I haven't seen them do anything that actually benefits men, and if they have, they've done 2 things that are detrimental to men. If feminism can fix men's problems too, that's nice. But what's wrong in making a community with people who have shared similar situations.
