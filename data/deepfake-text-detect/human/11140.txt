Any kind of nudity or gore is pretty likely to get removed from youtube, and even outside of that stuff it's still pretty common for videos to be taken down or have their audio disabled due to copyright or whatever. None of that happens with liveleak,also any copy written content such as music is removed from youtube. Even sometimes when its just playing in the background.
