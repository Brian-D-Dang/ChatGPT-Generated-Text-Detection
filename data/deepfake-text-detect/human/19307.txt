So this is something that I've been thinking for a while. I'm not denying that Tywin wasn't incredibly talented and generally good at ruling, but I feel that he makes a lot of decisions that are quite poor. 1. His plan to capture Ned, now this fails because Jaime decides attack Ned on his own. However, it's just a really poor and unnecessary plan anyway. So Cat started it, but invading the Riverlands escalated the conflict massively. Robert isn't even dead at this point, he doesn't even seem to consider what the Reach, Stormlands and Dorne might do. 2. He is pretty awful with his kids. Now it's obvious that he treats Tyrion unnecessarily badly which leads to his death, but I feel that him treating Tyrion poorly is part of the reason the he overlooks Jaime and Cersei's behaviour. Now I can understand why he is unhappy with Jaime, but Jaime joined the Kingsguard 17 years before the first book. I feel that his inability to deal with this is evidence that supports my point. 3. His decisions during the war. Now, he does ultimately win the war. However, I feel that he does it in such a way that undermines the status quo. I feel that the north is not pacified, but is more likely to now reject rule from King's Landing entirely. I am willing to discuss this more broadly that the points I raised, this was just what I had on the top of my head and from the book I had nearest to me. Generally, I feel that Tywin bought into his own propaganda and was less successful than he could have been. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
