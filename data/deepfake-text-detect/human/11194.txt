Within the atmosphere, the photons are being absorbed by the molecules in the air. Those that are not absorbed are scattered, which is why in dusty air you can see the dust dancing in the air - it's the light bouncing off the dust particles and flying off in different directions. The flashlight also doesn't send all the photons out in the same direction, so they spread into a cone. A laser has them more focused, which is why a laser's effective range is much larger. Now, light does spread out diffract a tiny bit on its own. But that's not at all the dominant effect until you're in space.
