Each religious denomination interprets their sacred text differently; picking and choosing what parts to accept, what parts to reject, what parts to interpret as factual, what parts to interpret as symbolic. There is absolute freedom of interpretation, meaning that you cannot scrutinise a religious group for not following word-for-word their sacred text because they are not obligated to do so. A recent trend is to use sacred texts against religious groups to contradict them, such as 'Jesus never said hate homosexuals' and 'Mohammed never said to hate infidels'. These are entirely invalid arguments because 'freedom of interpretation' relieves them of any obligation to fully follow their respective sacred text. Everyone disagrees with me on this point, maybe its wrong, CMV?
