For the longest time I kept up with the news but found it too depressing. I was having daily panic attacks because everything was just too much. It seems like the news is too sad and there's never anything good. I understand the importance of keeping up with political leaders to be an educated voter but can I simply just read about it when it comes time to vote? What other reasons should I watch or read the news for? I can't see any harm in not remaining up to date with what's going on in the world.
