On a computer? Your hard drive is starting to fail.','Most types of long term computer storage divide the data in to chunks called sectors. A "bad sector" is a generic term for any sector that the computer is having trouble reading clearly. It could be because it's an HDD and the magnetic coating on that part of the disk is going bad. Or it could be because it's a CD and the given sector was burned incorrectly. Or it could be a billion other things. Point is, "bad sector" is essentially the computer's way of saying "I can't read that word right there., "I'm not too keen on lots of the explanations here. Most people seem to think bad sector hard drive failing, but it could just be an easily-fixable, one-off corruption. Not necessarily a sign of failure. I'd certainly back up all the data on a drive with a bad sector as the first priority, but I wouldn't go straight to buying a new one and replacing it. I'd try tools like chkdsk first.
