I have an issue and I'm working to get over it. Whether it's in the classroom or in the workplace, I feel like I haven't performed as well as I possibly can until I have done better than everyone else who participated along beside me. For example, when I hear people complaining outside of lecture that a certain exam was incredibly difficult and I found it really easy, it's a big "pat on the back." On the other hand, if I hear people laughing about how easy a test was that I found to be really difficult, I become depressed. I realize that I need to measure my success in terms of whether or not I'm getting better than I was before, but I can't quite convince myself of that. CMV
