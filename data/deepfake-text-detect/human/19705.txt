I've been a transhumanist since before I knew the "official" term. Living indefinitely, whether it's from replacing telomeres and artificial neurons, or full on uploading, would be preferable to traditional death. Life might be difficult, annoying, and painful, but even after really bad episodes of depression, I have managed to again reach the mental state of not wanting to die. Even on the large scale, sure, nigh-immortality would cause a bit of disruption of the previous culture, but technology which bettered humanity in the long run has often reached opposition even after it became commonplace, from literacy to video games, from antibiotics to vaccines and transplants.
