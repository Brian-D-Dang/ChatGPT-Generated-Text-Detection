This is going to be buried already but what the hell I'll write my letter anyway. Maybe it will help me a bit. Mind you though I am not the most eloquent with my words. Dear Dad, I miss you! I know our relationship isn't what it used to be and I am sorry, I never should have let my relationship with come between us. When you moved in with me after years of being apart all I wanted was for us to bond and work on our problems we had. And instead, I allowed to rule my life. Between you two fighting and us arguing about what I should be doing I sided with her every time, pushing us further and further apart. For that I am sorry. I am also writing you to apologize for all the times I have disappointed you. Not showing up with out calling when we had plans. Not helping you more when you desperately needed it. Not being the son I should have been. For kicking you out because she wasn't comfortable with you in the house. For being the worst man I could have possibly been. I am so sorry. Words can not describe how terrible I feel every day for letting you down so often, for betraying you. I wish there was something I could do now to change all of the mistakes and poor decisions I made. I regret everything. I miss you Dad. It's been nearly six years since you passed and it kills me to think that if I would have just answered the fucking phone you might still be alive. I fucking hate myself for what happened and I wish I could go back to that day and make things right. Even if the outcome is still the same at least I could have tried. I love you and for what it's worth I am sorry. Mooscifer
