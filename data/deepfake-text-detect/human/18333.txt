I've read a few news stories that have used the term rise of the rest, and I don't think I need to mention America's exporting of it's manufacturing industry. It seems like the argument for these trends, is that it has lifted millions out of poverty and brought cheaper products to the American market. It seems like, if anything, these trends have contributed to the decline of the American middle class, and the detriment of most Americans. How hasn't it? If it indeed has brought cheaper goods to the American market, then who cares. What does it matter if the iPhone is affordable if none can afford to buy a house?
