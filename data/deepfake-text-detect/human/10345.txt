I believe that it is bad for humans generally that we have patriotism. It leads not only to discrimination. (hello Mr Trump) But also to economic and political difficulties and misstrust. It prevents not only people from accepting everyone as their partner in human, but also causes hatred and sometimes war between nations or ethnic groups. I dont mean that partriotism is worse than no patriotism, but that as a concept and as an element we experience all the time it it in itself bad for us. (Intrinsic badness versus comparative badness) Without patriotism we could form one great community and society. This is prevented by prejudice against others and arrogance about themselves, partiotism conveys. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
