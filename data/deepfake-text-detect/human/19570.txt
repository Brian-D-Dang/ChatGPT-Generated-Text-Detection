The fact is that the vast majority of males, especially in the U.S., are circumcised in the hospital within a day or two of being born. I believe circumcision originated as an old Jewish distinction, separating them from gentiles. More recently, infamous American prude John Harvey Kellogg promoted male circumcision to stop little boys from masturbating. Most parents who stand idly by today while this procedure is performed are not required by their choice of faith to circumcise their sons. It is pretty well recognized that the biggest effect of circumcision is a dulling of sexual sensation, and that there are no real substantiated medical benefits to the procedure. I have read that there is some evidence of circumcision preventing the contraction of infection, but from what I can tell there is little concensus on this point. Otherwise rationally thinking parents and medical professionals overwhelmingly propagate this useless mutilation of infantile genitalia. I think it's weird that it is so accepted in American society. Change my view. EDIT: American society EDIT AGAIN: I'm guessing that people are not reading much more than the title before posting to this thread. Many have accused me of saying things I have not. In NO WAY have I attempted to state that one form of genital mutilation is "worse" than another. I refuse to take part in that argument as it is circular, petty, and negative. All I have stated is that the two practices are simmilar (a word whose definition I would like to point out is not the same as the word equal). In both a part of someone's genitals is removed, and this is done without their consent in the overwhelmingly vast majority of instances for both males AND females. I am not interested in discussing "who has it worse" and that was in no way what this thread was posted to discuss.
