As far as I know, the Scottish might be a proud nation, but they don't have anything important. The country would crash in no time, because it's basically just hills and workers. There's no kind of big industry coming from there, nor are there important resources. The only negative thing about them being a part of the UK is that they're not an actual country, but, as I already mentioned, it seems to me like they only benefit from it. So yeah. I think that Scotland would be better off to stay in the UK. Change my view!
