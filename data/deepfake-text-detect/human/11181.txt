Rents in economic terms means a return on some input that exceeds its opportunity cost. The classic example is land in the city vs land far from a city, whatever activity you do on the land in the city is likely to earn more than on the other land. The strict definition is limited to natural resources (like location, mineral richness, or fertility). Quasi-rents refer to temporary or non-natural rents like the returns on a patent or copyright. These things produce a return over their opportunity cost (it costs very, very little to copy a movie but the copyright holder can sell it for vastly more than the copy's costs). That's like a rent from a natural resource, but isn't a natural resource. Without a bit more context, it's hard to say how he was using expropriation of the quasi-rents.,Were you studying First National Maintenance Corporation v. NLRB (1981) by chance? In this case, it was argued that employees had been induced to invest in training, at their own expense, that was only valuable within the company, which acted as a quasi-rent. Since the company benefited from training that would be of little use elsewhere, they are expropriating it. When the company closed down the plant, it was argued that the expropriation of quasi-rents meant they owed the employees some form of compensation. If I recall, it was a novel legal theory, but it did not have bearing on the outcome of the case.
