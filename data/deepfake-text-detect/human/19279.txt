I've held this opinion for some time, but it has come into contention among my friends recently, with regards to the impending blocking of online porn in the UK unless you decide to opt in to it. Of course, being a 17 year old male and against porn makes me a minority, but nevertheless, I have not been persuaded to change my opinion. I believe that pornography is too readily available to young children, who are viewing it at increasingly lower ages, partially due to the increased number of computer tablets children have access to now. This actually makes them able to access porn by accident and without prior knowledge of what it is. Blocking porn by default would solve this 'accident' issue. More importantly, the 'opt in' system would open up pornography to discussion. When I got my first computer, my parents talked to me about porn and how women aren't really how they appear in the films and men aren't all that well endowed. I still watched some, but wasn't so amazed by it, since I knew it wasn't an accurate replication of sex. I feel that communication is key to addressing the fixation some people have on porn and to the issues associated with that fixation. Furthermore, the fact that most teenagers don't want their parents to know about their viewing of porn suggests that they feel it is a bad thing to be doing. While I think that communication is the main solution to the problems with violence and unhealthy obsessions associated with pornography, a 'default block' is certainly the best thing to do about it right now. So, uh, change my view please. TLDR: A porn block would promote conversation about porn and its dangers and stop accidental viewing by young children.
