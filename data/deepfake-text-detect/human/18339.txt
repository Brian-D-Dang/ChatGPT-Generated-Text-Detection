I lean pretty left, but I don't understand the opposition to school vouchers. There is a public high school I live near by that really sucks. The graduation rate is about 70. College attendance is about 20. The same distance from my house there is a private Catholic high school. The graduation rate is basically 100. College attendance is 95. The county's per pupil expenditure is 12,000. Tuition at the private school is 15,000. When I was growing up why couldn't the county cut my parents a check for 12,000 so they could afford to send me to the obviously better catholic school? Why would this be a bad thing? The only argument I've heard against this logic is that all of the good kids will leave the bad school, making the problems at the bad school even worse. Why is this a bad thing? Why should the high performance kids have to suffer through a bad school for the sake of the problem children? The public school I went to was in the same county as the bad school, but was was actually pretty good. Our graduation rate was like 95 and college attendance was around 70. If providing a voucher to go to a private school would cause to much chaos in the system, why not allow students going to the bad public high school to opt to go to the good one? I knew a few kids whose parents lied about where they live to go to our school.
