Because of the British Empire. Britain went and colonised many parts of the world, so the KingQueen of Britain became the monarch of those places by extension. Some of those colonies were gradually given more and more responsibility for running themselves until they were effectively independent countries. Some of those kept the same monarch on as their head of state. So we get to the modern day where the British Empire no longer exists (although the UK has a few territories which are sort of remnants of it). But there are 16 independent countries called the Commonwealth Realms which all have Elizabeth II as their head of state (this includes the UK). The Commonwealth Realms are a subset of "The Commonwealth," which is a loose association of (mostly) countries which were formerly part of the British Empire. But most don't have a monarch at all, and some have a completely different monarch.
