Worst pedicure ever! Went in there for the first time yesterday afternoon. They were busy but still had plenty of chairs open for pedicures. My friend and I got seated right away and everything seemed great. Then the nail tech handed me the card to pick out which pedicure I wanted. The regular is 19 and includes nail trimming, brief massage, basic nail color. The only other option was a 40 one with callus remover, scrub and paraffin wax. Kind of ridiculous that they only have two options with such big price differences. All other nail places I've been to at least include hot stone and a decent massage in their basic pedicure. I chose the regular with no extras. The nail tech seemed annoyed by that and totally rushed through everything. The lotion massage was pretty much just her slapping some lotion on my legs. We were out of there in about a half hour, which is the shortest time I've ever been in a nail salon for a pedicure. The nail tech did not thank us for our business and did not ask to see us again... so I will never go back again!
