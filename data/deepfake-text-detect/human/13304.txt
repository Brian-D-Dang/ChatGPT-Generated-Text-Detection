The words spread from the skies of ancient Judea. From there, as incandescent as divine lightning, they flowed through the Old World and into the New; traced blinding webs up over the stately curve of the Earth to the international Moonbase; danced and wove through the terraformed clouds of Mars. They were a thing of beauty, designed to entrap the eye. Designed to ensnare. And this is what they did in old Reach, our first interstellar colony, as well as among the freezing nitrogen and glittering shrapnel of Elysium, our first interstellar war. And for a moment, the war stopped. The humans gazed up, shocked, and the crystalline Elysians craned their heads to the heavens as well. Not understanding. Not capable of sinning. But we were capable of sinning, weren't we? We'd been the original sinners. You and I, we've eaten of the Tree of Knowledge, sucked out its meat and spit the seeds upon the fertile Earth, and we could read the words God had traced in the sky as he finally made his disappointment known. For a moment I almost threw down my gun. I didn't want to believe it. But I did believe it, had to believe it, because it was designed to be believed and infused with the divinity of the most horrified Father anyone had ever known. " Fuck it, I'm done. You people are fucking crazy. You can all take care of your own damn selves. " The words disappeared when every child of the Lord had read them. Stunned, we gazed at the angel-winged Elysians across the killing fields, and wondered for a moment how we had carved our way here. Behind me, Colonel Nuke'em chewed on his cigar. "Looks like the same deal as usual, then." The Colonel shouldered his weapon again, chambered another round, and resumed making use of the only talents we had been given. And that was the last anyone heard from Him.
