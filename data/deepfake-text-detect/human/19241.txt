My reasons are as followed: 1. I want to switch majors radically from one field to another. The majors involved are really, really unrelated, and applying to graduate schools would be, not impossible, but much harder without the underlying foundation. 2. Financially, I would be given grants and scholarships to continue my studies. I wouldn't be burdened by too much debt, even though it would cost me (potentially) an extra three years of undergrad. 3. I cheated my way through my major anyway and didn't like it very much. I don't see much point in continuing. I have seen a therapist about these issues. They had said I was depressed...or something. That's tangential though. Those are my reasons. Feel free to pick them apart and try to change my view. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
