I can't believe they made me come to this school. I mean, I get that education is a good thing, but really, I have nothing in common with this filth. Every day I sit through a period of "lunch," just watching them stuff dead animals into themselves, parts of plants, dried out grains, forcing it down with sugar-water, some of them even animal milk. It's utterly disgusting. Then I sit through more lectures, the regulars excusing themselves to rid their bodies of the same crap they ingested, only now it smells much, much worse. And the breathing! Don't get me started on that! How is anyone supposed to concentrate with that going on? Just a never ending cycle - suck air in, blow it back out, suck air in..... It's an endless cacophony echoing in my head. The homework at least is a joke - at least for me and mine. By the time I get let out of here every day, I have at least fourteen hours to finish it. The regulars waste more than half of that doing absolutely nothing. They literally just lie there with their eyes closed. Of course they keep up with the breathing - it almost seems like they don't have to think about that. But the more I think about their weaknesses, the better it makes me feel. As long as more of my kind keep being made, those obnoxious regulars will be extinct in two generations.
