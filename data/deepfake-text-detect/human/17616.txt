I live in the United States, I am against abortion, and it confuses me that if a woman is killed while pregnant it is classified as a double homicide (implying that the baby was alive), while abortion in the first two trimesters is legal. Does the baby only count as a life if the mother wants it to? NOTE: I do not want to debate abortion, I simply want to understand what seems like a double standard.
