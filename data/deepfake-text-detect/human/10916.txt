When you injure one leg or hip it often means you are unable to weight-bear (hold enough weight) on that particular side of your body. What this means is that the other side of your body has to pick up the slack to prevent you from toppling over. The cane is designed to take some of this weight off your hip and leg (which is now being asked to do twice the work it was designed for) and redistribute it to your arm and shoulder (which has some strength to spare when it isn't busy lifting or carrying stuff)," "It makes more sense to have the good leg in the middle since then the gait isn't terribly lopsided. Plus, the arms naturally swing counter to the legs while walking. If it was used on the same side as the bad leg, you would have your left arm and left leg moving forward at the same time, followed by your right arm and right leg. It would be extremely ungainly. The cane moves forward with the bad leg because it is meant to help support you when the bad leg would be carrying the weight. You just hold it on the good side. URL0, Keep the injury in mind, as this may cause it to differ. A person with a cripple leg and a functioning leg needs balance. In order to re-obtain this balance a cane can be used to redistribute weight (downward forces from the rest of the body) along the remaining legs (i.e. functioning leg cane). This means the cane needs to be at the spot where it can bear the most weight, which is as close to the center point of gravity as possible, which can be anywhere, including the "opposite leg.
