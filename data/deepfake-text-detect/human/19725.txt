Well, today I was doing hugs for 1 euro each for a schoolar trip. I has been doing this for two entire days and I'm kind of exhausted about it, but I still have to offer hugs for 1 euro with a wide smile on my face. Long story short, I was walking around with a group of friends (Because if you sell hugs with friends it's more effective and more funny), and then I met this man. I looked him in the eyes and said something like "Hey man would you like to hug us for one euro? It's for a schoolar trip we are doing this year," but this fucker motherfucking ignored me. He motherfucking ignored me. He got in front of me and sidewalked to the right. He didn't even have eyecontact with me. He did it the most offensive way possible. "Whatever" I thought. "Man what a son of a bitch" I commented with my friends. I turned around and decided to offer a hug to some old lady. The fucker that ignored me turns around and said: "What did you say?" he said "Do you want a hug?" I said "You called me a son of a bitch right?" "Yeah" "Do it again?" "What's the big deal? You ignored me the most offensive way possible. I find ignoring more disrespectful than insulting some. You find it wrong?" The motherfucker then grabs the piece of paper that says "Hug for 1" that I was holding and throws it to the ground. Some more things happened but it's irrelevant at this point I know that it's obviously not correct to do it, but I know that in that situation I would disrespect that man again not only by insulting him. I would even punch him. I have been offering hugs at 1 for 2 days 8 hours each day and I was fucking exhausted physically and mentally. Is that why I find more disrespectful to ignore someone than insulting him? Please, I ned external opinion on this. Also, sorry for bad english. It's not my native language. edit: going to run atm, so I will be responding comments in 1 hour or so.
