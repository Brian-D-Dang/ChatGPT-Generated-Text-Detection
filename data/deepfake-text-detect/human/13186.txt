The creature looked at his creation, and at the one sitting in front of his friend. There was a drastic difference in the globes. The creatures was browning and toxic, occasionally letting off the odd nuclear blast, while the friend's was glimmering blue and green, with puffy white clouds drifting just above the surface. "A'akkakki, what did you do?" "What do you mean? " , the creature's friend responded. "You know what I did, Kk'iittik, we started with the same model." "Yeah, but yours is so nice. The dominant being on my planet destroyed it. I don't think that's supposed to happen, I'll probably fail." "Oh, you must have missed it. You'll probably get a C at least, you managed to keep them alive, even if the world is failing." "Missed what?" "The divergence. Right at the beginning, there were two possible paths for the model to take. I just smashed the mammalian one." "So what took over?" "Saurids."
