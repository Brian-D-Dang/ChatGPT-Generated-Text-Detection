To my knowledge pricing cannot be the reason as aluminum and copper are both relatively cheap raw materials. Copper costs more than three times as much as aluminum.', "It's a combination of price and cost. Copper is more expensive per pound than aluminum. This is why there are thefts of copper wiring and other copper products because the copper can be melt down and sold. Aluminum can be collected but it does not sell for as much. Copper is also denser than aluminum. This means that the same volume of copper is heavier than aluminum. A heavy heatsink will pull at the motherboard and may cause structural issues based on how it's mounted on a vertical motherboard. This is also the reason why the long high voltage wires are made of aluminum instead of copper (this is for electrical conductivity, not thermal). Even though aluminum is more lossy for electricity transfer, it is much lighter and cheaper so the wires do not sag as much and you can buy more of it.,Wrong. Copper is very expensive, aluminum very cheap. Price (and availability) is what drives this. For reference, the current London Metal Exchange (the world metal standard) price for aluminum is 2071.00 per tonne and for copper is 6515.00 per tonne. Copper is more than triple the price of aluminum by weight. While the difference for the small amount of metal in your computers heat sink might be slight, multiply that by the tens of thousands of devices made by the manufacturer and you start to get into real money.
