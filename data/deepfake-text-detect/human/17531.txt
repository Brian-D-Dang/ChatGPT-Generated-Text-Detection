Here's where this view comes from: I have a good friend here at school whose father has served in the National Guard for 10 years. He is currently in a non-deployable position and has only been deployed once over his service time, for about eight months and in a position that the family describes as one of the safest jobs he could have had. This friend is now receiving money from the Veteran's Association on the order of several hundred dollars every month because of her dad's military position. She already has enough scholarship and loan money to completely pay for school without this extra assistance. I can understand why a family would need extra help if a family member from the military had significant health problems as a result of military service that required financial expenditure to solve. I have a cousin who was deployed for several years and has severe PTSD as a result. This has required a lot of mental health care that I know was expensive for them. I don't have a problem with government assistance in this case. But I don't think that it's fair for family members to receive benefits just because their parentspouse has done a certain job.
