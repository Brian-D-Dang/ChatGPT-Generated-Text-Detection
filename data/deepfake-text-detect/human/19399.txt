It's going to be hard to sum up this belief. What is real is constructed entirely through cognition and reality is the overarching cognitive framework we use to impose meaning and structure on our experiences. All concepts such as shape, color, friendship, love, employment, electromagnetism are accessories to this process. I think of this as being similar to finding shapes in clouds. Truth is extensively socially constructed due to the importance of social processes in our cognition of the world. Even very basic concepts like shape and form are taught to us. The process is unavoidable. If you avoid communicating a concept explicitly, it will still affect your behavior and be tacitly communicated to others through social processes. Science is not immune to these effects and the construction of scientific knowledge is a social process. Pre-existing conceptual frameworks paradigms" in science) are the mechanisms used to interpret new evidence. Data has a different meaning depending on existing cognitions and has no meaning without them. Change in our concept of things in response to new experience is not becoming closer to an external truth. The configuration of our existing concepts determines the new beliefs we form in response to experience. It is possible for two people to fundamentally disagree and both be right. Not all beliefs are equally valid or true. Some thoughts are not useful and consistent with each other or our experiences. However, I believe there are a variety of valid beliefs for a given set of experiences and many beliefs are self-fulfilling in the way they affect our environment and cause us to select and interpret information. I'd like to clarify that this is not solipsism or nihilism. I believe in truth, knowledge and an outside world, but I believe that it is impossible to talk about these things in a way that is divorced from the socialcognitive framework through which we conceive of them.
