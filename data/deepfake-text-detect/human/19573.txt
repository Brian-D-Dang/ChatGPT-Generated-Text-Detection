I work at a grocery store where about 50 of the customers pay with food stamps. Now many of them make what I would consider smart decisions in regards to what they use the money for and I don't judge any of them based solely on their method of payment, but others buy items that I don't think should be acceptable purchases. Many people come through my line using their benefits card to buy nothing but several bottles of cooking wine, which I have a very hard time believing is being used for cooking. Others spend 50 just on soda or candy. I feel like these aren't "necessities" and I feel like it's a waste of money. I believe that the money should be spent on nonluxury" items and primarily foods that could be included in a meal. EDIT: My view has been changed on letting people buy the foods they want. But not on cooking wine. I think that, because of how little it's used for actual cooking when purchased in this manner, it should be classified as alcohol and not an option for those on food stamps.
