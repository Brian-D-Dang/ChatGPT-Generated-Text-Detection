The amount of resources that Snowden claims the NSA has would cost an insane amount and would be extremely wasteful. We probably could have and did spend our money on more useful technology, not monitoring everything. But if you cannot afford the surveillance the next best option is to pretend that you have it. Many stores and busses have fake cameras that are very visible in order to deter people from doing anything illegal. It is my belief that the NSA "leaked" prism as a fake camera to make people paranoid about their communications. This also reminds me of Reagan's fake technology that he scared the Russians with in the 80's. The main reasons I believe this is because when I have read stories of guantanamo bay lawyers claiming that they believe their phones were being tapped they knew because of obvious odd noises from their phones. If the NSA was so powerful this would not have happened. Also the response to Snowden was almost comedically poorly handled that I believe that they wanted us to believe they had been caught with their pants down. Also the fact that we cannot find the plane or rule out that certain groups stole it makes me think that the NSA's surveillance cannot be very good. To change my view show me why the NSA must have the surveillance program and that it is feasible for them to have it, or that if they did not have the surveillance they would not have wanted to pretend that they did.
