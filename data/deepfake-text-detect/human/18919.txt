Debates are among the most irrational constructions that humans have developed. Their rules are designed to undermine rational interchange. A debater is not allowed to say, "That was a good point, I'll have to rethink my views." Rather, they must adhere blindly to their positions even when they recognize that they are wrong. And what are called "skilled debaters" know that they should use trickery and deceit rather than rational argument to "win." When we look over the record of famous debates, we find that they are not "won" on the basis of serious argument, significant evidence, or intellectual values generally. Rather, the outcome turns on Nixon's five o'clock shadow, Reagan's sappy smiles, lines like "have you no shame" or "you're no Jack Kennedy," etc. That's not surprising. Therefore, debates are useless and a more constructive form of discussion should take its place to deduce the most appropriate outcome of an issue.
