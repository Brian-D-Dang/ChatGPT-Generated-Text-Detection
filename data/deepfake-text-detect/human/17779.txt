I often see people deriding others on Reddit for making a "not all feminists are like that" or "not all men are like that" etc., type of argument. Saying that it's tiresome, and overused or whatever people have against it. But it's an entirely valid point to bring up. If someone is making a generalization about a group of people, then it's worth it to call them out on their generalization. And "not all X are like that" is a quick, easy way to do that. People who complain about people making that argument should probably stop making generalizations, rather than to complain about it when people call them out on it. Change My View.
