I have had many friends who have struggled with addiction ranging from alcohol to heroin, and at their meetings they receive the impression that addiction is a disease and not truly their own fault. I disagree, as most of the time it is the users own choice to first injectsmokedrink and have no one to blame but themselves once they get hooked on the drugs. Because I see it as a choice and not a disease, I feel they should not receive sympathy or medical help and instead see it as their own fault for starting the drug. Change my view.
