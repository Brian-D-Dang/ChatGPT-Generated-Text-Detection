Dirk told his friend that he had made a grandfather clock by hand. Dirk's friend asked him how he got and installed the glass. Dirk explained that a local glass service put it in for him. Dirk's friend pedantically said Dirk didn't make the clock by hand. From then on, Dirk told people he made a'clock cabinet' by hand.
