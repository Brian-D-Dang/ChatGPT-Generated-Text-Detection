Samsung's new Galaxy Watch 5 Pro will have a capacitive touch bezel instead of a rotating bezel. It will have a raised bezel to provide more protection to the watch face. The lower-end model will have a similar look but with a flat front. Both models have a rubber watch band. Both watches should be released in August. Leaked images of the watches are available in the article.
