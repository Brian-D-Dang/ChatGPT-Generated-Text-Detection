With great power comes great responsibility, but Peter Parker fails to live up to this ethos choosing instead to limit his own power in an effort to limit his own responsibility. First of all he has access to his fallen foes and fellow Avengers technology, but time and time again chooses not to employ those resources in his efforts to fight crime. He chooses to be reactionary instead of proactive in his crime fighting favoring his own patrols as appose to ensnaring his enemies in his web. He fails to delegate responsibility to the police or other heroes and in doing so fails to help those around him; he also fails himself as this non-delegation doesn't allow him to create a fulfilling personal life or career. He also fails to create real consequences for his rouges gallery, a collection of career super-criminals and freaks with little to no chance in career fields outside of super-crime and the creation of chaos. In stark contrast, after taking over Peter's body. Dr. Otto Gunther Octavius "retires" a fair number of super-villains, creates an army of goons and robots to help him take down crime, achieves his doctorate, establishes a company that helps the crippled to walk, and sorts out peter's love life beyond pining away for a hot girl he knew in high school, someone who's just plain wrong for a super genius to be with anyway.
