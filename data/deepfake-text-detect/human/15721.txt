Worst company out there. I live in a community managed by ACM and it's a joke. They are rude and anytime you have a problem or complaint and call about it you will start getting letters saying that there are problems with our own property, in my case the letters were addressed to me but the pictures were of different properties not of mine. When I called to tell them it wasn't my house they treated me like I was lying. They've lost a money order I sent, and were never able to find it so I was out the payment and had to pay it again. I've lived in this community for years and our entire community is in agreement that we have the worst HOA management company ever. In fact the first time we ever received a community newsletter from them was after our entire community received a letter from another home owner who wants to be voted onto the board so that we can find a new management company. In the 6 years prior we've only received our annual financial disclosure, meeting information, and plenty of violation alerts. I'm looking forward to having a better HOA management company, and I'm sure now that I've posted a review I'll get new violations for all sorts of imagined things, or problems on other properties, but that's ok. I'm getting smart about it and now keep a copy of everything I do and they do in return in a file marked HOA Management harassment so that my attorney can handle it. I'm just going to keep letting their harassments and incorrect violations and mistakes add up.
