I think most people who are against socialismpro-capitalism think that socialism is just raising taxes on hard workers and giving it to the lazy. They think capitalism is about rewarding hard work. Well, in fact, the two systems both have that same end goal: to reward hard work. However, contrary to what we've been told, capitalism doesn't necessarily do this. Socialism is the better economic system because it actually doeswould reward hard work directly. Take for example, Nike. Their products are produced in Indochina (could be wrong about that, but the location doesn't matter much to the point I'm making). These Indochinese, though generating the most capital for the company, are often times the ones with the lowest incomes in the company. And where does all of the extra money go? To line the pockets of the executives. Capitalism has created the delusion that simply paying someone else to do hard work that you directly profit from, is hard work. Socialism is about doing the opposite, and making the class of people directly profiting (and profiting the most) from the labor the same class as the ones actually performing the labor. CMV
