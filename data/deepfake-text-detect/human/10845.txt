The reason is water pressure. Pressure wants to equalize. So when you are running 1 tap, you are getting all the pressure, and when someone turns on another tap you get half the pressure and they get half. Your house is likely running 12" pipes through most of it, and when your wife turns on the cold water both feeds are sharing half of the supply (but your hot water isn't being shared). If she turned on just the hot, then you would get blasted with cold water. The other bathroom probably has a 34" pipe feeding from somewhere to supply a large amount, then gets broken down into 12" feeds to each unit (sink, tub, etc).','It also has to do with the way the plumber designs the rough-in plumbing. It's usually a problem when the shower plumbing is down-line somehow from other fixtures. In higher end homes you will see a "manifold" type system that prevents this from happening.
