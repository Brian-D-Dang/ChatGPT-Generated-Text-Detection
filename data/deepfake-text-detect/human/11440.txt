Skelleftea is a town in the far north of Sweden with a climate-conscious focus. It runs on 100 renewable energy and recycles 120,000 tonnes of electronic waste a year. The town recently erected a 20 story wooden skyscraper. It is made up of glued laminated timber and cross-laminated timber. The nature of the wood made construction incredibly fast and there was practically zero waste on-site. Many more details about the building, including photos, are available in the article.
