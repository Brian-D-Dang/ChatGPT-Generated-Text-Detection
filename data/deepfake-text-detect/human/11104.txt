He has plenty of authority. He doesn't have a workable approach. He can't just turn the people loose, they are "threats to America." He can't just kill them, they haven't even had a trial. He can't get anyone to agree to a plan to try them, so the situation isn't changing. He's bringing it up in hopes the Congress will accept some plan, any plan, to try these people so they can be convicted and executed. Very few think that's going to happen.
