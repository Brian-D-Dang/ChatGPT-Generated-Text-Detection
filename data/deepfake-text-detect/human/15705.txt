I'm really pleased with the services that we got at this place. My wife and I are on a specialized meal plan that requires that we weigh and measure all of the food we eat. This kind of planning and prep makes it very difficult to eat out. However, the folks in the deli here were very helpful and accommodating to our requests in this regard. Then, when we were in the checkout line, our clerk offers us bags of ice to keep our food cold on the way home. This is far and away better service than the Whole Foods in San Mateo back in the Bay Area. I even remarked to my wife that I wish they could just pick the whole building up and relocate this Whole Foods to the San Francisco area. We'd come often for the great service. Prices are higher here than at Safeway, etc., but you are definitely getting what you pay for.
