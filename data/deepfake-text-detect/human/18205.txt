My argument doesn't stem from a human rights standpoint, but instead from wanting to punish the criminals that deserve it. If a person's crime is bad enough to deserve to be put to death, then why give them the easy way out? It'd be more of a punishment to let them rot in prison with no chance at parole. Spending endless years in prison with other high threat criminals is the worst punishment and therefore the appropriate replacement for the death penalty. If that criminal poses a threat to other prisoners, isolation is always an option, being an even worse punishment than regular prison. On the opposite side of the spectrum, getting rid of the death penalty would ensure that no innocent person was accidentally convicted and put to death before proving their innocence. The death penalty also costs the taxpayers much more than life without parole. This is due to the extra judicial matters (i.e. investigation, trial, appeals) needed and the cost of lethal injection. So not only would eliminating the death penalty provide for a tougher punishment and ensure no innocent people are lethally injected, but it would also save money.
