I feel guilty whether I give or don't give to the homeless. We've all heard how giving to homeless people can support addictions or foster a cycle of dependence. However, I feel that the personal gain I get from maintaining an altruistic nature and keeping people as people outweighs any harm that I cause to them. I think, in the long run, that motivates me more to help in more substantial ways, such as volunteering, which I do frequently. So even though I may be doing more societal harm than good in the short term, I think it pays off in the long term. Why should I not behave this way? Edit: Nice work; I'm mostly changed. I will start donating to a charity instead and use panhandlers to remind myself to donate if I get out of the habit. Now I just have to get better at saying "no," ha.
