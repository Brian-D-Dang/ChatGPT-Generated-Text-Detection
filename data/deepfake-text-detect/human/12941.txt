My life ended, but it wasn't the shambling moaning hell I thought it would be. It certainly was terrifying and painful. I was pulled from my wrecked car and the zombies clawed and bit me. But rather than devour me like I had seen in the movies, it was if they had lost interest. They got up and walked away. One of them even waved and said "Bye." I started laughing, it was just too absurd! Then what I thought were delusions set in almost immediately. Suddenly the world was not in flaming ruins. Suddenly the zombies were gone and many people were wandering around looking confused. I found a cheerleader sitting on a park bench and asked what had happened. "Evolution," was all she said and returned to staring blankly at the peaceful lake. I was sure if I concentrated long enough that the hallucination would fade and I could see all the zombies and burning buildings. I must have stood there for hours staring at the distant towers. When the sun finally set I shook my head and scratched at my long curly red hair and wandered off. I needed to go home and get out of this dress, it was torn and splattered with blood. I was hungry, but I wasn't sure what for. I grew up with stories and movies about zombies loving brains, but I wasn't sure that's what I wanted..... a nice, juicy, raw steak suddenly sounded appealing though. I decided to stop at the grocery store on my way home and see what they had.
