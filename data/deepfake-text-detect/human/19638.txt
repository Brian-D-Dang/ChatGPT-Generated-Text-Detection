This was somewhat covered in a CMV post nine months ago, but it didn't quite cover my concerns. Gmail, Search, Glass, Analytics, Maps, Earth, AppsPro Apps, the pathetic Google, YouTube, Chrome, Drive, Voice, Calendars, etc. They also make the Android OS. [They're even delving into medical devices.] Recently, they announced the acquisition of Nest Laboratories. Nest is a learning thermostat and knows when you arenot home, your exact GPS coordinates, and your wifi password. I don't want Google having that information. I love technology, but if black-hat hackers bring down Google, or if something happens and they go offline, [as happened last week] , it could have a devastating impact. CMV, so I'm not so paranoid about the U.S. becoming the United States of Google Corp.
