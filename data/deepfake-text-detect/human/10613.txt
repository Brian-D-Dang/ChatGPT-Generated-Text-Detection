As far as the itching from a bit is concerned: The itching you get from bug bites is called pruritus in the medical community. Scratching helps relieve pruritus by producing a small amount of pain. The nerves at the site of the injury send the pain signal to the brain instead of the itching sensation, so you temporarily feel relief. A [study] (URL0) published in 2014 demonstrated that when that pain signal reaches the brain, the chemical serotonin is released, and may cause increased sensation of pruritus. This is currently thought to be the reason scratching can make pruritus even worse.
