Okay not literally morons but I think it's very incorrect and overall an extremely lazy way of thinking about those people. I think that peoples' political affiliations do not accurately reflect the sincerity and integrity of their moral convictions. Living in an overwhelmingly liberal area, I always hear people say that Republicans as a whole are greedy and selfish and just want more money and won't empathize with anyone of lower class than them. Overall Republicans are seen as decidedly immoral. I even hear similar things about Libertarians as well. While I am rather left-leaning myself, I think that that sort of anti-Republican sentiment is lazy and, somewhat ironically, indicative of an inability to empathize with those peoples' convictions. EDIT: Okay, obviously I should have narrowed my statement a bit. I'm talking about the more 'mainstream' affiliations here. I'm not saying that Nazis and Islamists are moral, I'm more talking about Republicans, Democrats, Libertarians, etc. talking about other affiliations as if they are immoral. Hello, users of CMV!
