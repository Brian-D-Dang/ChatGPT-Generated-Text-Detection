To start off I just want to firmly say that I am definitely not one of the people that think that everyone is a lazy drug addict. I completely understand that there are some people that genuinely need help and am not against welfare, though I think it needs to be reformed. I frequently see the argument that people on welfare should be drug tested in order to receive the benefits because the person whose tax money went to the welfare system most likely had to take a drug test to get their job. I don't see anything wrong with this, though people that hold pretty similar political views to myself seem to. I think that welfare should be a means to get by until the can get a job, and if you can't pass a drug test you won't be getting a good job anytime soon. The argument that drug testing would be assuming that everyone welfare recipient is an addict just doesn't hold up to me if potential employers are going to say the same thing. The other argument that I've heard is that the children on these drug users should still benefit from the welfarefood stamps, but I would argue that I child should be in a home with a drug user. Even if it's something as harmless as marijuana, they shouldn't be in the care of someone that is spending their money on weed rather than necessities or someone that doesn't have the self control to give up using while they're looking for work. I'm very interested in social justice issues and interested in becoming a social work, so finding out what I'm missing here is really important to me. Thanks!
