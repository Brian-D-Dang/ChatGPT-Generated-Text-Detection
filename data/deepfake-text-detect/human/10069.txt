If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will be available. On a nationwide scale, decreasing population means available work. Natural resources of food, water, fuel, and other materials are becoming scarcer everyday. On a global scale, less population means more available goods to all. What result (s) of an increasing population size could surpass these benefits? If we were hypothetically at the growth cap for the human population, would everybody still get frantic like when it's is brought up that the U.S. born citizen population is reproducing below replacement? Edit: it seems a lot of the response pertain to economy. I suppose I was wrong in respect to a declining population being beneficial in this aspect. However, I still seem to feel that a shrinking population would benefit us as a species. Our survival, and that of our environment, would be better off with less people. But still, I'm open to changing my view.
