I personally haven't seen any reaffirming evidence supporting the contrary, but it has been touted along by many people at least on Reddit as a speculative explanation for what is generally speaking, unnatural to mammalian biology. For example, there is no correlation between population density and people who identify as gay per capita [source] . For the record I am not against gay people or gay rights in general. Live your life however you would like. I just have seen this opinion touted around as fact, and would love to see some evidence to cmv. Tl;Dr I don't believe that population density has any correlation to gayness per capita. CMV
