There's no catch-all answer here. Depending on the nature of your friendship with a boss, it could easily lead to accusations of favouritism, and dating in the workplace is so common, that bosses dating underlings is not really out of the question entirely either. It depends on the workplace, and the politics or culture of that workplace as to whether it can work or not. The general basis for having fraternisation rules, though, is because when people break up there's a good chance one or the other will look for another job, so they don't have to keep running into each other (and each other's dates). That awkwardness is perhaps less among broken friendships than it is among broken relationships.
