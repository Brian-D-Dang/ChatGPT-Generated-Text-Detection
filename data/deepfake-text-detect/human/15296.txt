I am not usually a fan of buffets but before heading to Las Vegas I took some time to read about several places that were of note, especially within my hotel. Wicked Spoon was apparently one of them. Not your traditional buffet, the portions were individual and of fantastic quality. No spooning your eggs out of a mass vat here or harsh heat lamps. For example; look at the above mini eggs benny!? Each table was given a large glass bottle of Aquahealth water and of course unlimited coffee, juices etc and if you paid a bit extra, unlimited mimosas, bloody mary's or champs! I am a sucker for miniature versions of things..the takeout boxes they put the asian cuisine in were no exception. Also offered: korean bbq, miniature fried chicken drumsticks that come in your own little fryer basket, prosciutto pizza, duck confit ravioli with sage (sweet and savory perfection) beet and arugula salad and so much more. I loved that even though it was morning there were excellent lunch options which I sampled without holding back (it was for research!) Other dishes of note: the chicken apple sausage was heavenly, mini croissants, hash, fruitcheese bar, sausage station in general, asian fusion area and a carving station. I had read that Wicked Spoon previously did not have labels on everything to encourage conversation about the food. That has since changed which made things pretty convenient. The service was impeccable - I would return indefinitely and recommend it highly if and when you return to Vegas next!
