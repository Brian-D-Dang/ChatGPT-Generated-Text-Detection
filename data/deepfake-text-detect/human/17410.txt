I have seen numerous posts lately along the lines of "I don't like bacon, CMV" or "XYZ musical act is not good at music, CMV." These posts are based on personal taste, and there is no logical argument that could make the poster change their taste. These posts seem to be more of a statement, rather than a call to change their view. The obvious rebuttal to this would be how do we define a removable post, since there would be some grey area.
