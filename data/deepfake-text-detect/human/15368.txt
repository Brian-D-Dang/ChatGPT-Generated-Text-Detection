To give it two stars is being generous. I don't even feel like reviewing this place. The only reason we had so much fun being here is because we ignored all the negative stuff and just climbed. I'll just make this brief. 1.) It smells like socks and dirty shoes. The ventilation is not very good and if you're there for hours, maybe you'll just get used to the stench. 2.) The receptionist was not helpful, condescending, and acted like helping us was too much out of the way. Probably just got used to regulars and is very nice to them. But to newbies, forget it. My cousin is the nicest guy you could ever meet and will even go out of his way to buy food for the poor. He just wasn't worth the time to be given good service to I think. I think if the smell wasn't so bad and if service was better I would recommend people to come here or myself to come here to have fun.
