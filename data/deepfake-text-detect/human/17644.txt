Basically, I believe that I should adjustfine tune myself and find where my values really lie. By meditating daily and attempting to remain as mindful as possible at all times, I am increasing my capabilities and molding myself into a better person before I enter the "real world" as a college graduate working at something for a living. I frequently question my own beliefs and viewpoints, and I pay close attention to anything during my day that irritates me - my reaction to such an event exposes me to something more about my sense of self and therefore it allows me to function more properly in daily life from then on. I find this work to be more important than any work I do for the classes I'm taking at college. I am still getting by, and I will earn my degree, but it's totally peripheral to my "inner work." I believe that this is the best possible use of my time currently.
