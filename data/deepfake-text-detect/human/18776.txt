Even though Bill Russell won eleven championships, and Chamberlain was always something of a headcase that only got two championships, when people say that Russell was the better player, I can't help but disagree. My main reason is that I think that championships are a bad judge for historical rankings of basketball players. While Russell was one of the best defensive players of all time, he also was surrounded by one of the best thinkers in NBA history in Red Auerbach, and was surrounded by some of the best players of that era in Bob Cousy, Sam Jones, John Havlicek, and many others. Chamberlain never had the same amount of talent surrounding him with the Warriors and 76ers. While Russell was certainly a defensive centerpiece for those Celtics teams, I feel like his offense was so much less than Chamberlain's that giving Russell the nod is giving Russell credit for things that many people deserve for the Celtics dynasty of the 60s.
