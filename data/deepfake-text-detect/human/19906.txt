If the government seeks to deprive me of the means (like a gun) to defend myself against people who seek to harm me or my property, then the burden of responsibility to protect me falls on the government. To me, what that means is that the government should be readily available to give me an equal chance of protection as if I myself had a gun to neutralize any threats (like armed intruders). Realistically, this means that police need to show up within 10-20 seconds if there is an armed intruder in my home. I think that is enough time for me to survive (via running or hiding) as an unarmed person facing off against an armed intruder. If someone is in injured or killed in a situation where they could have defended themselves if they had a gun, but were unable to do so because the government deprived them of the means to defend themselves, then I think the government shares some part of the blame for allowing that situation to happen.
