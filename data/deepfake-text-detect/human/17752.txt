I believe that being gay relies on many factors such as environment, upbringing, and chemistry. I don't really believe there is a gay gene. Just like not all straight marriages produce straight children, not all gay marriages would produce gay children. My thinking is like this: Parents have a high influence on their children, their actions and mannerisms impact their kids.
