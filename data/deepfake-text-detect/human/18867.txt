I have read that upwards of 41 of Americans say that they believe we are living in end times and that the world will be coming to an end in their lifetime. This view is also shared by many American politicians including Michelle Bachmann and Rick Perry (both candidates for President in the last election.) I think politicians that hold this view couldn't possibly be qualified to weigh in on matters with long term consequences since they don't think the earth will be here at that point. Global warming is a good example in which they have no incentive to care whatsoever about the condition the planet is in if it's going to be gone soon anyway. I think it can also have an effect on your foreign policy decisions like when we saw Michelle Bachmann get almost giddy about the prospect of war with Syria because she thought this would fulfill the prophecy of Damascus being destroyed actually saying Rather than seeing this as a negative, we need to rejoice, Maranatha, come Lord Jesus, His day is at hand." On a side note, I do find it ironic that it's these same people who are so concerned about our debt, which leads me to believe that they don't really believe it's the end times, which I think speaks to their character and again shows why they shouldn't be considered legitimate candidates. Edit: Just to clarify, I don't think there should be anything legally stopping them from running. I just think the electorate shouldn't view them as a legitimate candidates for public office.
