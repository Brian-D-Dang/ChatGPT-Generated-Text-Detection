I think that most people get tattoos to show off a persona to other people rather than display artwork of personal meaning. This is not to say that all people do this, but I think a vast majority get them for attention because tattoos are taboo or trendy or hardcore or whatever else. To be clear, an image of interest is not the same as an image of personal meaning because the canvas is inked for different reasons (the latter being more important in my opinion). For example, a sleeve of spiderwebs is different from a family crest or memorial. This is evident as well with the people who willingly receive tattoos of corporate logos they themselves are not otherwise affiliated with. "But, it's my body, so it's all personal..." True, but your meaning behind the tattoo is what makes it personal, not just that it is literally on your person; if this is your argument, why not wear a t-shirt instead? In shot, Change My View that most people get tattoos for others instead of for themselves.
