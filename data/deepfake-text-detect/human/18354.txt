I hold the view that creating a united world government would present more problems than it would solve. Like we already see today, the radically different views between countries (and even inside them) would likely lead to riots and uprisings, only on a much larger scale. Legislation already takes months to get passed; With a world government, the process would likely take years. Using the democratic system of government we use today would create a constant squabble between political parties. Again, we see this today, and its effects would be even worse under a world government. Please, try to change my view. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
