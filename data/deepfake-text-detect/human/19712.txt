I don't think unpaid internships are "on-the-job training" systems that help the next generation get on the job ladder. The social contract is broken, and nowadays unpaid internships are systems used by cynical capitalists to get free labor. I've seen this first hand. As a result, I think unpaid internships should be outlawed, it should be considered slavery, and these fuckers should be put in jail for a long time. Let me stress that I'm only talking about unpaid internshipspaid internships" make no sense to me. That's more "provisional hire with a shitty salary." So, yeah. CMV.
