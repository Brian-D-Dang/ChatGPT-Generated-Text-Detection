Giaccherini, 31, joined the Black Cats in 2013 from Juventus for PS6.5m but, after an impressive first season, he struggled to make an impact.

The Italian has 29 international caps and scored the Azzurri's opening goal of Euro 2016 against Belgium. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.
