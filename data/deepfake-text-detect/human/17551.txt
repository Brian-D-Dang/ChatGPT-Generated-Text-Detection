I am refering to this tackle. It looks like it is on complete purpose. He takes away a huge scoring chance, by taking the player down who would be two on one. The ball is not even near the incident. Taking a player without the ball down on purpose should give a red card. and taking a player down and taking away a great scoring oppurtunity should also give a red card. Due to Carvajals tackle, Juventus got a penalty and thus did not lose anything from Marcelos tackle. But that is because Carvajal made a bad decision. Marcelo takes a way a clear scoring chance.
