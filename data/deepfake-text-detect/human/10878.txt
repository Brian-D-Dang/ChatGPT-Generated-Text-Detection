Hi I'm currently taking a geology course where my professor does her research in Antarctica. Typically she spends 3-4 months of the year (October-January) there studying the sediments to find how the earth has cycled during its life span. There are many things you can learn by analyzing ice cores or (can't think of a better term) ground cores. Antartica is largely undisturbed so there so the data is more accurate. Different things you can find by observing cores from Antartica are how the Earth has a CO2 cycle (From naturally warming and cooling), and that this cycle also modifies what sedimentary rocks are formed.
