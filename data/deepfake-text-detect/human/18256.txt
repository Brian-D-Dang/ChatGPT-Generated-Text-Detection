I am not just saying that the evidence supports Darwinian evolution more than creationism, because that position would be too easy to defend. I am saying that there is not even room for reasonable disagreement on this issue. If you're not familiar with the evidence for Darwinian evolution, you can learn about it [here] . I'll list a few lines of support very briefly. 1. The fossil record, together with radiometric dating, indicates that organisms evolved over millions of years. No anachronistic fossils have been found. 2. Vestigial organs like the appendix exist that serve no useful purpose in modern organisms, but would have been useful to our ancestors. There are also atavisms, like when a human baby is born with a tail or when a whale is born with legs. 3. Fetuses developing in the womb retrace the evolutionary history of their species. 4. There are remarkable similarities between the DNA of different organisms. For example, we share 85 - 95 of our DNA with chimpanzees. These lines of evidence and many others are best explained by Darwinian evolution, not by young earth creationism, old earth creationism, or any other form of creationism. To change my mind about this, you will have to outline a non-Darwinian theory that a reasonable person could hold in light of the evidence.
