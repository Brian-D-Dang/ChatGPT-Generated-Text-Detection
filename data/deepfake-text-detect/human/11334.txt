Netflix plans to offer a less expensive tier supported by advertising. Many of its competitors have ad-backed tiers and many advertisers have pushed for the streaming giant to let them advertise on the platform. Netflix will not use data tracking and ad-matching for its ad-backed tier. The company is experiencing a decline in subscribers and subscriber growth. Adding a lower tier could help bring more price-sensitive users back.
