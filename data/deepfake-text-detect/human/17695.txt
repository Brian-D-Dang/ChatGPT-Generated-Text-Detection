A lot of people make 'throwaway' accounts when they are making a post (or posts) they think will get downvoted. The fact that they made the 'throwaway' account shows intent and their intent is to be trolls. I understand sometimes people have legit reasons for using 'throwaways', like if they don't want to be identified because they are posting about something sensitive or whatever. But I think it sucks that so many people are posting with 'throwaways' just so they can say racist, sexist, or homophobic shit anonymously. If I notice that someone is using a 'throwaway' (like if they have never submitted a link and most of their comments are insults) then I'm gonna vote them down. What else can I do? This is sort of off topic but sometimes I wish there was a rule where you couldn't post comments on a sub unless you have submitted at least one link to it. Anyway, if you think there is something cool about being a troll and using a 'throwaway' so you can hide how lame you are then please CMV, I would love to stop looking down on people like you because I know looking down on anyone is useless and just makes this world a less chill place to be.
