If you can strip and rebuild an engine, you have far more mechanical knowledge than the average person. For most people it means putting it in a garage and paying someone to do the work. There come a point when the cost of doing the work (parts and labour) exceeds the cost of buying a replacement bike. There are many vintage bike owners who do all the work themselves and who's bikes have done 250,000 miles plus. But that's because their bike is their hobby, not because it's economical.
