With the rise of cheap small "Cube Satellites," startups are now taking photos and infrared images of factories, retail parking lots, oil tankers, and more and selling these images to hedge funds and banks looking for an edge in gauging economic activity. Governments and human rights groups use the technology as well to track illegal mining and logging operations and large-scale home demolitions. Human Rights Watch says "This is why we are so committed to these technologies. They make it that much harder to hide large-scale abuses." A small 10 pound satellite now costs only about 3 million.
