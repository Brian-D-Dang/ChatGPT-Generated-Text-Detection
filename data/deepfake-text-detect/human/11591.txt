India shut down the internet in the state of Assam during protests against a new citizenship rule. The Citizenship Amendment Bill, which creates a pathway for citizenship for minorities in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, was recently approved. Residents in the state of Assam were protesting as they were unhappy about immigration from nearby Bangladesh. Governments are increasingly turning to shutting off internet access as a way to stop protests. In 2016, the United Nations condemned internet shutdowns as a violation of human rights and freedom of expression. There were 196 internet shutdowns worldwide in 2018, with most of the shutdowns occurring in India.
