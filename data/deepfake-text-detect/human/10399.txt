First of, this is only talking about people who are vegetariansvegans for ethical reasons. If you are a vegetarian for any other reason, this does not apply Being a vegetarian is more expensive than eating meat. Therefore, you need to get this money from elsewhere. This ultimately ends in a society having less moneyresources, which they can give to the poor. Thus, you are kind of killing humans in trying to save animals. So vegetarians are basically putting other species of animals above their own, which I would say is objectively bad. Of course, this is not how society works, you are not directly killing people by being a vegetarian, but you are not directly helping animals either, so that is not an argument. I fail to see any argument against this. What about you?
