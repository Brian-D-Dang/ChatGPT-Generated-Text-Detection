I wish I could have gave this 0 stars but I can't first thing there was a hair in my food and everyone has only ate a little of there food and had to stop cuz we was disgust my one friend Alex was sick from it them we got the manager and she only was gonna say sry then we was like can u take all this off and she only took the noodles off although we a couldn't eat our food it seems like everytime I come there there's a problem or hair in my food and I think it's because we ask for our food crispy when I ask Chrispy we get a hair when we don't no hair plus very rude customer service NEVER EAT HERE
