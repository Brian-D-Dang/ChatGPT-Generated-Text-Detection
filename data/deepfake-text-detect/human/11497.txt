Mozilla has created a new VRAR browser called Firefox Reality. Mozilla has rethought everything to make a browser usable in virtual, mixed, and augmented reality settings. Text input is still a chore, so they have voice search. They've worked with a number of creators to bring a large collection of games, videos, environments, and experiences that can be accessed directly from the home screen. As always with Firefox, it is built with privacy in mind (this 1.0 release includes a private browsing mode) and it is free and open source. There is a 40 second video demo at the end of the article.
