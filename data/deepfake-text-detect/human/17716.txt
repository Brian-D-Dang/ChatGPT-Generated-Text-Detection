I think porn is a freedom of expression, censored porn just hurts the porn industry which may hurt the governments potential tax revenue. What are the pros and cons of censored porn? What was the law or ruling that enacted censored porn in Japan and how can it be overturned? Some people may argue censored porn is in place for the protection of children, but you could bring up the violent movies and video game debate. Why is violence allowed but not sex or porn? Others may say Japan has weird porn like tentacles or bukkake but that clearly isn't all their porn and the U.S.Europe has weird porn as well. Some may argue Japan has a conservative culture but what about Japanese youth not wanting sex anymore, maybe a uncensored porn industry could change the culture to benefit Japan? ] Why allow any sort of porn at all in Japan, why not just ban it all together? Would showing a crotch without a blurry strip really harm anyone more than what they already can see? And as a non-Japanese citizen, I would like the option to see non-censored porn, is there a way around the blurriness?
