Regardless of the advances in technology, the human race as a whole will never band together as on for the progression of our species as a whole. Terra-forming, I think is a pipe dream, and for something to be accomplished on that scale, we simply lack the amount of resources and technology to do so. I think we might establish a colony on mars, but I believe that would be as far as we go. Tell me why I am wrong.
