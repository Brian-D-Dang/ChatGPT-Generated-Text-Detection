The more postmodern or liberal philosophy on people is that we seem to be genuinely good or pure beings that eventually become corrupted by society. I disagree. I think people at their core are pretty bad and things like love, compassion, and generosity are things that society has to instill in us. People always talk about how pure children are. What are the things you constantly have to hammer into children? Share. Don't hit people. Play nice. These are things that children need to be taught because when left to their own, they don't share, play nice, and they often hit each other. I'm not a religious person, but if there is something that Christianity got right it is that people are naturally sinful. We are prideful, selfish beings, just like animals. The thing that separates us from the animals is our ability to try and curb our violent, selfish nature. It is not the lack of the violent, selfish nature that we share with animals. I guess the way I would need you to change my view would be to convince me that what we consider to be evil is taught or comes about because of upbringing, and that what we consider to be good behavior is inherent in humans, not instilled by society.
