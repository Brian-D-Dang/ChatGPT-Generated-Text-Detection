Let me clarify by saying this: in CERTAIN contexts I can understand why marines might be justified in taking umbrage at this behaviorif we are talking about a conversation between two members of the military who might be expected to be well aware of this bizarre quirk of nomenclature, then I suppose that would be more circumstantially justifiable. But among the general public, where the word "soldier" is used broadly to describe anyone who fights as a member of any sort of military in any capacity, it unrealistic and absurd for marines to expectmuch less demandthat civilians not follow their usage of the term. Soldier is a very general term that (outside the USMC) correctly describes their function, and that has been in use in the English language for far longer than the USMC has even existed. It is unreasonable of them to argue that the random convention they invented for themselves, which contravenes a much older and broader usage of a very common term, should be followed by non-marines. I have spoken with a few marines who take the issue very seriously, to the point of getting animatedly upset at those who refuse to conform to their arbitrary distinction between the two, and I think their behavior is childish and borders on genuine detachment from reality.
