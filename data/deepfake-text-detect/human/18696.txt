I have come into contact with a lot of military people who think they are somehow better then others because they are in the military. Especially those who like to call civilians "sheep" it really pisses me off, because that is stupid. Also those who think we "owe" them something, I owe them nothing. Or those who like to brag andor complain about all their time away from their families like it makes them special. My father in law works on an oil supply boat, he is gone one month, home one month, gone one month etc. There was a year when he was gone for two months and home for one month. So how does that make military people special? EDIT: Duffman1701 did point out that there are assholes in every group, and a society as a whole does owe the military as whole. That changed my view somewhat. I still don't automatically respect someone just because they are in the military, and I still think anybody who refers to anybody as sheep, for whatever reason no matter how "sweet" or whatever you are trying to make it sound you are still referring to someone as a farm animal. I also don't owe some one who is in the military and has a job that a civilian can do. In other words, if you have a job that a bunch of civilians have and you have NEVER seen any battle or anything like that, I don't owe you any more than I owe the civilians who have the same job you do, just not for the military. But my view has somewhat changed.
