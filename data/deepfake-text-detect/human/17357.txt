Before I start let me state that I have personally have and still have my bouts of depression and thoughts of suicide. But I dont ever really plan on doing it, its an interesting thought and in the words of Hunter S Thompson "I would feel trapped in this life If I didn't Know I could commit suicide at any time." But I browse around on this site, and see posts where uses say they have their whole suicide planned out date and all. Continue to write a story why life is no longer worth living. And other uses rush in and offer help and a person to talk to if they need it. I personally wouldn't try to talk them out of it, If they really where dead set on doing it, nothing I would say to them would change there mind. The typical "life is worth living." "Keep holding on it will get better." Speech from an anonymous Redditor isn't going to change my mind, If someone is posting things like this on the internet almost every time they just want some attention. Anyways, Change My View.
