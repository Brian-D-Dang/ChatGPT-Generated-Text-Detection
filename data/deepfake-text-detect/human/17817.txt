I am a strong supporter of organ donation as a whole and have yet to hear any convincing arguments as to why anyone (anyone medically permitted, obviously) would choose not be a donor. If people are simply uncomfortable with the idea of being 'harvested' or think doctors will deliberately fail to save them if they are a donor, I find it hard to believe that they can justify this against the lives they could save. This article praises the rise in donations but there were still only 1200 people who donated in the UK last year, a number that seems pitifully small compared to the death figures (around 480,000 in 2011) Would love to hear: Any convincing non-medical exemption arguments against being a donor Flaws or issues you can see in an opt-out rather than opt-in organ donation system I'm posting from the UK so information on the US system (or that of any country, as a matter of fact) would be appreciated as I'm largely uninformed on this issue outside of my own country. Any other opinions on the topic As I've seen this as one sided for so long I'm looking forward to hearing counter arguments and seeing a good debate.
