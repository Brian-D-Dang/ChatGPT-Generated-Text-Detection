Money's just money. If money can be anything then it is essentially nothing. If the main thing about money is that it is fungible (that is, money can be exchanged for a fancy new car or a great house or a pretty wife, etc.) then it essentially has no inherent value. And people who have a whole lot of money have a whole lot of nothing. How does it affect my life? Well, I just don't worry about it. When I have money then I spend it or give it away. And when I don't have money, then I just don't spend any. I don't worry about paying my bills, or savings, or my credit score or anything like that. TBH, it drives my family crazy. I figure as long as I have enough for a cup of coffee and a little bit of food, with enough left over for some art supplies, then I'm happy. I have a vague sense of worry over what happens in the future, but not really. I just can't bring myself to care about money. CMV
