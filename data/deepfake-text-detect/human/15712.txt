GROSSLY OVERPRICED!!! This is a Franchise...... not the Orginal. My opinion.... the food dosen't match up, to the original. Mind you..... its OK, but certainly not Great. This location is 4 miles from my house. I drive past them, on my way to eat at Taste Of Chicago, for my dogs. My wife and I, usually don't agree on many things. However, we agree on giving Luke's a pass.
