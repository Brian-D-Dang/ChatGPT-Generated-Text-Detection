I was born and raised in a western Country. I see in the recent data scandals, e.g. prism etc., a huge danger for our society. Partly influenced through the read of the book "1984," in which exactly such system, obviously more advanced, enable the ruling body to dismiss such fundamental rights as the right to free expression. Through this ignoring, unimaginable horrors fell upon this specific society. Because of this and the well reasoning behind the human rights, i believe in them. Ps: As of this is my first post in this sub and english isn't my native language, i hope i'm not mistaken in making this post.
