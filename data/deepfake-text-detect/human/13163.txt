The ringing of the doorbell broke the silence of my empty home. It was just me that night. Me and now some pizza.'I wonder if they actually made it without crust.' I thought.'Probably not.' I answered the door. "Hello, I've got an order for one cocaine." The pizza delivery man said. "One cocaine? Oh no. There must have been some sort of miscommunication. I ordered a pizza without crust but as a joke." I replied. "Oh, what a hilarious misunderstanding. That's our code phrase for ordering cocaine." He replied. I laughed. "Gee. That really is funny. I'm sorry for the inconvenience but I'm not really feeling cocaine this evening." "Oh, no problem. You have a good evening sir." "You too." I replied and closed the door. 'What a funny misunderstanding' I said to myself as I began to make myself a pizza but this time with crust.
