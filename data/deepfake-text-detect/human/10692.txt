There are a few theories about where they come from. The Miller Uray experiment explains how they could have formed from some kind of goo that excisted in the early days of life. This goo contained all the elements necessary to make the chemicals known as amino acids, save a few. The last elements, nitrogen and oxygen where found in the atmosphere. So when the goo boiled (the earth was much warmer back then) the fumes went into the atmosphere and the frequent lightning storms helped combine all elements together. The amino acids are the building blocks for proteins. The amino acids are linked together in a long chain and this chain folds upon itself and becomes a protein. The proteins have maaaany functions in our body. There are a loads of them. They are the building blocks of our muscles, they control the flow of other proteins and other chemical compounds in and out of our cells. Hopefully I contributed. Otherwise I've wasted 5 years taking my Masters in Molecular biotechnology
