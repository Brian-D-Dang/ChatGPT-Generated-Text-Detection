Obedience to authority figures solely on the grounds that they are authority figures is a moral failing that reduces a person to moral bankrupcy and animality. If one is instructed to carry out an act, one must question the act upon its merits. Delegation of moral responsibility to others is something that befits a cringing coward, not a person with moral agency. Little Eichmanns who do delegate their moral responsibility to others are less than human and should be treated with the contempt they deserve. The only right course of action for an individual is to strive to understand what is right and wrong, and to direct one's actions in a manner that is maximally conducive to the right. Any less is a shameful failing. Those incapable of this act are 'less than', deprived of a fundamental moral faculty that moral agents must possess. It is an overvalued concept that is embraced and cultivated by religions like Christianity, and preserved by those of a regressive and conservative persuation. Obedience is only a virtue to fascists, cryptofascists, totalitarians and authoritarians and those lacking the ability or courage to proclaim their concept of right and wrong and act in accord with it.
