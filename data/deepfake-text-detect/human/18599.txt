I don't believe there's anything other than a question of pure willpower when it comes to kicking addictions like meth, cocaine, food, opium, krocodil, alcohol, etc. I believe if you cannot quit these things cold-turkey, your willpower is essentially weak. No one is physically forcing your hand. Of course, if your body is so dependent on it that you risk death or actual injury from not weaning yourself off, then by all means, wean yourself off instead of stopping right then and there. I honestly don't see why it's such a hyped up struggle when you can literally just stop, or use the minimum amount each day to wean yourself off. Edit: Thanks for the responses, I didn't realize it went much deeper than a simple problem of willpower. I'm sorry if anyone felt like I was belittling their struggles with addiction.
