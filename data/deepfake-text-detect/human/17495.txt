Often I see writings that talk about the harsh penalties of the past and in other cultures, like taking off someone's hand or being given the death penalty for theft. Simply, if harsh penalties for minor crimes were effective against the human need to commit crimes, these things would never need to occur. Politicians who claim to be "tough on crime" while increasing the penalties are just playing against peoples' anger and desire for revenge without much consideration of making society safer or solving the problems that led to the crimes in the first place. Here is my reason for offering this CMV: It's coming up to election time (US and Canada). Politicians will be ramping these statements up at the exact same time that private prisons and policing are very much in the public eye. I want to make informed opinions. Hello, users of CMV!
