They said we would not live long after the sustainment fields collapsed, and it's true, we were once six hundred strong reduced to eighty. Mostly women and children, all fortified in the belly of the inferno..... my city Hades. The long version of how humanity dwindled down to only a handful of people is nothing new. War was waged, weapons were used, by the time nuclear blast 23 occurred, bio weapons began being used, then experimental. It was truly mutually assured extinction agenda Russia was the last hope, the smart men of the world convened and began digging as the skies blackened. Unprecedented storms ravaged the planet until the light was no longer visible. Five years passed and people sort of gave up on war, the anger dissipated as quickly as it began. Those remaining chose to live and burrowed with the rest of us as the planets entire ecosystem began to die. The last tree I saw above ground was a pathetic excuse of pine, not even fit for Charlie Brown's christmas tree. Ten years later, the surface was now entirely toxic from gamma radiation and sweltering heat. Twenty miles below the surface. You would think water to be the most precious commodity, but here in Hades it is the air our tree farm is the new religion. I work in the tree farm, my job is to keep the oxygen levels for the rest of the city just below 20. It's currently topping out around 8, the elder council has issued a mute order, talking in public is punishable by dioxide rations, which most people do not survive. Each tree in the farm represents a living individual in the city, if a citizen dies then a mating partner can conceive a child and the life is replaced in queue of the tree to the previous owner. The youngest oak tree died today at seven feet and four inches, despite my best efforts to revive it, this particular tree belongs to my son. If the elders refuse to take my life in exchange for his..... I don't know what I will do.
