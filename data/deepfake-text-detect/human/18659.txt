I love my immediate family and a couple of my cousins, but I would never spend time with most of my relatives if I didn't have to. The only reason I agree to go to most family gatherings is because it would make my parents happy. Also, people always ask me how my (twin) brother is doing, and I usually respond with "I don't know, pretty good I guess" since were not that close (were definitely friends, but we rarely talk about anything personal). They act like we should automatically be best friends and share everything with each other.
