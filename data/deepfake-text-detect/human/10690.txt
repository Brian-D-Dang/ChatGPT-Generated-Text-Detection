If this is the case, those sites that are inflating the value of the hotel room's should automatically be forced to lower their prices, due to the laws of economics, as who would ever pay more money for the same thing that someone else is offering for a lower price? This assumes that consumers are aware of all the prices available to them, which they are not. Trivago is making money from equalizing the market through providing information, similar to how currency arbitrage can provide profit while equalizing the market.,Trivago does not negotiate with hotels directly. The way they make money is through commissions and affiliate commissions. They load up hotels and show you all the websites you can book the hotel from. The reason why you may see the hotel cheaper on Expedia than Priceline on the Trivago website is because the hotel has sent Expedia a lower price than Priceline. When you make the reservation for a hotel you found through Trivago, Trivago gets a portion of the commission that the hotel pays the website. For Example: You go on Trivago for a hotel in Los Angeles. You click on the Orbitz "deal," which takes you to the Orbitz website for you to complete your reservation. The hotel pays Orbitz a commission (usually between 18-22) and then Orbitz pays Trivago a portion of it. Kayak also works on a similar model. Hope this is clear.
