First the disclaimer: I don't like extreme censorship, I know where the lines are that I think shouldn't be crossed in that regard, but that isn't what I'm here to discuss. I also don't think we treat sexuality or violence in a healthy way as a culture. That isn't what I believe this is about. My view is that the the snide line often used on the internet any time there is an outcry against sexual content or immodest behavior, i.e. "They are okay with their kids pretending to blow eachother's heads off in call of duty but the kid can't see something natural like boobs!?," is irrelevant to the issue and creates the false impression that middle America thinks sex is worse than violence. I think sexuality is seen as shameful because it is something our culture views as private. Violence is more tolerated not because it is better, but because violence is often public. Basically, because one thing is more shameful than another does not mean it is worse. Maybe rCMV can make me see this from a different perspective.
