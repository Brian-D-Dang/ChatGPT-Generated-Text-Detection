Note: I am an American, so for this I'm mainly discussing American citizenship. We should be able to agree that all people are equal. If all people are equal why do some have a harder time gaining citizenship than others? Is someone who was born in the U.S any better than someone from Canada or Mexico? No. So why do they get automatic citizenship while foreigners have to wait years. I believe that EVERYONE should have to pass basic intelligence tests and U.S history tests for citizenship regardless of national origin. CMV
