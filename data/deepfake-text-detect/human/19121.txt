It would be nice if we could have absolute security and absolute privacy, but in the real world we have to strike a bargain between the two. On one end of the spectrum (absolute security), we have a totalitarian state wherein the powers that be (government or cult head or whatever) see or know everything and are able to control and regulate everything, ie an ideal totalitarian state. On the other end of the spectrum we have the situation wherein there is no over seeing body and everyone has complete freedom to do what they want (anarchy). The real world is somewhere between these two extremes. My fear is that, currently, we are veering too far towards the totalitarian side with NSA spying and whatnot. I understand that in order to have more freedom I have to give up security and I'm ok with that. More specifically, that means I understand that things like 911, the Oklahoma city bombing, the Boston marathon bombing and things of that nature are more likely to happen, but that's ok because the chances of those things happening are relatively low. My freedom to do what I please is more important to me. CMV edit: I mean indiscriminate spying, aka what the NSA is doing now. This means legally mandated spying such as what happens when a warrant is issued for an individual, group or singular event is ok.
