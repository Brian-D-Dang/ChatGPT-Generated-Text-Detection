You know that I am all for Google being for gay rights, and "Not being evil" but the problem is they do some shitty things and no one calls them out for it. They seem to have a holier than thou attitude and really only do things that benefit their self interests. I believe their current page with the remarks on gay pride etc are totally self serving. I am all for gay rights. But I fail to see what Google is actually doing. Has Google blacked itself out in Sochii in protest? I really think it is just a marketing tool that says "Hey, use Google, we're cool with being gay" I am actually more scared of how Google has worked with the NSA. But I am really more upset at the fakeness of their current page, and how Reddit just ate that shit up. Hundreds of posts about how great Google is for a hollow gesture. It really is no more than a lapel pin.
