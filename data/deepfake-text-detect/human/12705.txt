The clock rolls over to midnight and I shoot out of bed. I look in the mirror to see if anything is different. I know I'm supposed to wait until morning, but it's to exciting. I'm finally sixteen years old, and ready to unleash my powers. I extend my hand as if I could shoot a bolt of energy. Nothing. Not even a fizzle. I put my finger to my temple to check if my telekinesis has kicked in yet. Still nothing. "Well this sucks..... Maybe I'm broken." I eventually slumped back into bed after trying out several other ability cues. All my friends said that's how they found their abilities. Josh has manipulation of fire. Jenna can fly. Timmy..... Well Timmy can make things change colors. Kind of a lame power, but I'd take that over my nothing. As I continued to think about what it could possibly be I dozed off. Morning comes in the form of a streak of light hitting my face from the window. I rub my eyes and crawl out of bed to see my mother lying on the floor next to me. I let out a yelp as I check to see if she's alive. She's not. I start crying and run to the living room. My dad is sitting on his chair and greets me. "Hey champ, what's bothering you?" "Moms dead!" I shriek. My dad runs to my room and sees then turns to me and grabs my arm. "You did this!" He yells. As soon as he touched me I felt stronger, and my father grew weaker. I watched his life leave his eyes as he fell on the floor. "What kind of power is this?" I say aloud. Then I remember my parents powers. Mom had the ability to teleport, and dad had the strength of a rhinoceros. I turned and looked at my front door. Then I imagined myself being outside it. Before I knew it I was standing in my front yard. It worked. "I take powers from those I kill. I guess they'd better save the cheerleader." (Lame and long I know. I don't really care. First time doing this. And I decided to toss in a Heroes reference. Also it's late and I'm too tired to think anyway. Night.)
