To be clear, I'm writing only about antidepressants in thread. I'm a 22 year old college student. I've taken almost every antidepressant on the market at some point over the last 6 years, and have slowly dosed up to 40 mg of [Viibryd] daily for the past 3 months. This morning I drove to my psychiatrist's clinic for my appointment, unfortunately during a very busy time of day for them. I waited for around 30 minutes for a 15 minute meeting with the doctor's PA. I was told about a new antidepressant called [Brintellix] , which, according to her, "is the new hype recently." I also had my cheeks swabbed for a new [genetics test] that claimed will determine which antidepressants best suited me. I wasn't once asked how I felt about my current medication (which I haven't taken for 3 days because I've been out). My originally goal was to get more samples of the Viibryd so I wouldn't go another day without my medication, but I didn't expect this to happen and I went with it. But enough with the story. My gut tells me that a very well-paid pharmaceutical rep came into the doc's office and explained to him why he and his staff should prescribe this new antidepressant. I have the same feelings toward the genetic testing company. Part of me feels that my mental health isn't the top priority for the lady I saw today or the main Psychiatrist working there. I think they're as certain as I am as to how effective or safe this new antidepressant is, and only know it's effectiveness solely from what as I tell them. It's complete bullshit that this seems to be the only basis for if, how, and when Psychiatrist's choose adjust their treatment plan for patients. I feel like a number and not a patient. I've been told that Viibryd is an SNRI by one doc, while this lady is telling me its an SSRI. Bottom line is I don't feel my mental health is in good hands with these professionals. Somebody please convice me otherwise so I'll have some peace of mind swallowing this first pill.
