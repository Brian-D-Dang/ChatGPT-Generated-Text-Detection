Hi there. So, I recently came out as bi-gender to my boyfriend. As it turns out, he doesn't think that really exists. He is of the opinion that someone can't have multiple genders (or no gender at all, for that matter). I've used every argument I could think of, even saying it could be considered a mild form of schizophrenia. His only argument has been that it just doesn't make sense to him. Even saying it doesn't always make sense to me didn't help. Despite this, he's been asking what I want to be called and such. Since I don't need any changes to be comfortable, I've asked him repeatedly to forget it, but he won't. At this point it may be easiest if you convince me I'm wrong. I wouldn't mind arguments to either side, so fire away. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
