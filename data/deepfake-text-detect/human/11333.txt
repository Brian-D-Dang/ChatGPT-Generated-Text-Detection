NASA's Parker Solar Probe has captured images of Venus' surface. Venus' surface is blocked by a thick atmosphere, which makes it hard to take pictures of. However, the surface is very hot and it makes the planet glow a faint red during the night when there is no Sun. The solar probe used the red light to capture images of the surface as it flew past at night. Some of the images are available in the article.
