First of all, excuse me for my bad english (this isn't my home language and I'm on a phone so typos). Murderers should be sentenced to death. I believe this mostly because of the aspect of the victim's close people. How can one live in peace while knowing the their loved one's murderer might be released from jail sometime. Why does the murderer get to live and gets a second chance for living and fixing life while the victim doesn't? This is not fair and not right. Please, I'd love if you would change my view or at least give me a different aspect of this.
