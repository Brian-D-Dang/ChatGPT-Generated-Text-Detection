First of all, let me get one thing clear. I am fully in support of gay rights, I believe homosexual people deserve treatment equal to heterosexual people. Now my problem with gay pride parades is simple. Being overly "camp," lewd and all "in your face" in these parades does nothing more than confirm the prejudices of homophobes and hurt the legitimacy of gay rights campaigns as a whole. Being straight has no particular stereotype of any sort attached to it, it's not something you march about and base your entire lifestyle around, it's a sexuality and nothing more, so homosexuality should be treated the same way.
