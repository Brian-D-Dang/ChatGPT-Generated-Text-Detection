I think the healthiness of the grass is one of the major factors. If a pitch is played on constantly the grass would be destroyed. They probably wait a few days to get some good watering and a cut to get it back up to scratch.','According to [this guide] (URL0) to natural grass pitches, even a great pitch can only be used 10 hours per week. In addition to the 90 minutes of play time, teams have one training session in the same stadium and the pre match warming session. It would ruin the pitch to have games there every single day.','There are many technical explanations about having space to train, and the quality of the grass, etc, but in the end, comes down to corruption. More venues means more building contracts which in turn generate a metric ton of kickbacks and bribes for those who award the contracts.', "Most comments cite the pitch, but think about the place sociologically. So all the games are in one venue. So what? Hotels. Public transportation. Restaurants. Everyone of them surrounding and by the arena cannot cope with the tourists. With 9 or 12 venues, you don't have the English only fanstourists in the same area at the same time as the Italy fans unless they are in match together. Multiple venues and game times prevents urban congestion to a degree.,so the pitch has time to recover. If they played all 4 matches on only 4 pitches, by the end of the tournament, the pitch would be unplayable. Spreading it around gives each pitch a rest, and the grass time to recover before the next match','There are 12 stadiums in order to funnel taxpayer money into the hands of government friends and supporters, the 2016 Olympics is the same. Brazil is just doing what everyone else has done. Look at the "scandal" of bribery for Qatar world cup.
