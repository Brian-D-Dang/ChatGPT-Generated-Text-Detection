Those are two different things. Stubbing your toes is equivalent to jamming your fingers. Think going to catch a basketball, but it hits your finger straight on and jams it. That hurts like stubbing your toe. When you bang your hand, the pressure is dispersed over a wider area. When you jam your toefinger, it is focused on a tiny area - the joint.','One factor could be the resistance built in a part of body due to previous exposure. Our toes are not used to stub everyday while our hands bang around while doing things so they get more resistant. In addition to personal resistance, evolution may have changed our pain sensors to have different sensitivities based on the function of the part of body. For example your fingertips are more sensitive to texture variations of a surface in contact vs a part of skin on your back or your thigh.
