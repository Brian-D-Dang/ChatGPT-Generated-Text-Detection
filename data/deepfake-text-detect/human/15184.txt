Black jeans, grey shirt, black tie and black Chucks. Sounds like something out of every hip GQ man's closet, my closet. As cool as I dress, sorry to disappoint, that is your waiter's wardrobe my friend. Super sexy and super loud. Decor is modern and cool as heck with their M16 lamps. Yep, you heard me, M16s! I couldn't read the chalk, but rumor is someone wrote the Art of War up there. I guess the M16's make sense now! Food is A-okay, a lil' pricey though. My only gripe is about the bartender (see ART of Yelp), as I have not forgotten.
