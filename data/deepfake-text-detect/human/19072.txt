The Japanese government has been committing horrible acts off their coasts and in international waters, specifically whaling. Many organizations such as the United Nations have urged Japan to back off its whaling practices which are not only inhumane but also damaging the ecosystem. Yet, the Japanese have been able to slip by under the ruse that it is for "scientific purposes." I don't want to come off as some raging environmentalist, I really am not. But the Japanese government just has continuously lied and cheated the system all for some meat from animals that have proven to be quite sentient, almost near human capacity. Therefore I believe that the best response is for the United States to place an embargo or trade restriction on Japan in order to cause some sort of change. The US is the best actor for this due to the large trade relation between the two nations. The embargo would urge Japan to ease off its whaling and solve the issue at hand faster and more efficiently than any other way.
