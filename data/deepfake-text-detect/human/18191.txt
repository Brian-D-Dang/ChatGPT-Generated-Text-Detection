Let me preface this by saying that I'm currently a junior at the University of Illinois and I'm a fairly liberal thinking person already. I have plenty of friends with more conservative views and we discuss politics all the time and they tell me that they wouldn't dare share their views in the classroom. They have seen what happens when a student tries to express an opinion that isn't shared by the professor. I was in a class one day and somebody raised their hand and explained why she thought that giving out free condoms would encourage teens to have sex. The professor embarrassed the poor girl. The professor got the rest of the lecture hall on her side and humiliated the girl for thinking differently. Now I don't agree with that girls view point on condoms at all, but nobody deserves to be embarrassed in front of their peers like that just for trying to explain their point of view. College is supposed to be a place where people with all kinds of different cultures come together to share ideas, beliefs, and customs. However, at todays campuses, we gather all these people with different views and try to make them all think the same. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
