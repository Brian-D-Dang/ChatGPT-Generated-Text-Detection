As obesity has become an "epidemic" in America and other countries around the world a "fat acceptance" movement has become more popular. This is the most idiotic movement I have heard of with people saying we need to accommodate them and give them special treatment. while I worked as a cashier years ago I got disgusted by people who took the electronic carts because they can't walk 10 ft without running out of breathe and even more disturbed that thwy all had handicapped parking stickers. If obese people get diabetes, arthritis (knees) (ankles), scoliosis, they should be 100 responsible for their medical bills by private insurance and without government funding. With everything available to lose weight and keep a healthy diet and literally free exercise I don't believe there is such thing as healthy fat because you can always become more healthy. CMV
