Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring, 71, was accused of painting the candy stripes to "get her own back" on neighbours who objected to her property plans. She wanted to demolish her Kensington house and replace it with a new dwelling and two-storey basement. At the High Court she is challenging Kensington and Chelsea Council's policy of restricting basements to one storey. She is taking court action alongside construction company Force Foundations. Ms Lisle-Mainwaring hit the headlines in April after painting her house in red and white stripes. Residents called the design "hideous and tacky," but Ms Lisle-Mainwaring said they were being "hysterical" and denied the paint-job had been done to spite her neighbours. The High Court hearing is expected to last up to three days.
