Perhaps this is only a reddit, but something I've noticed in many political debates is how much the points of view differ between (for example) Libertarians vs Socialists, or Anarchists and Statists, and how pointless and circular the debates become. Typically when someone tries to debateargue, one side will talk about how everything in their system is completely right and pure, and can't be damaged by flawed humans, and the other side will say that's all garbage because of human nature. Everyone says that people will act like the logician's perfectly rational person, and handwaves any kind of flaw that could appear. A highly paraphrased but typical argument about taxes: Libertarian: Taxes are stealing Socialist: They're the cost of living in society, and we should take care of as many people as possible Libertarian: That's what the free market and charity is for Socialist: Not enough people can or will give charity to compensate Libertarian: Yes they will Socialist: no they won't (Ad nauseum) The thing is, it's not like we can model any of this system scientifically, or have two similar countries with Twin A in one country and Twin B in the other and see the outcome from the two politicaleconomic models. So at the end of the day, trying to argue about it just seems pointless, and no one is going to change their mind. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
