Full disclaimer: My experience in driving manual transmission cars is very limited. I spent about a month working in an auto center, so I had to have a crash course (no pun intended) in driving manuals. I know how to make the car move, and I wouldn't have much trouble moving it to another parking spot, but I've never driven one on an actual road, and I've never had the car past first gear. So here are the reasons that are usually given for driving a manual: It's more fun It saves gas mileage it's easier to work on It makes you a better driver However, I'm not entirely convinced. First, driving a manual could be more fun, but I see my car as a means of transportation. I use it to get from point A to point B. If I didn't have to be somewhere, I wouldn't be in my car. Next it the issue of gas mileage. In the past, manuals always had better mileage, but automatics have caught up so much that the gap is insignificant. In fact, some automatics actually get better mileage than their manual counterparts. For example, [take a look at the 2014 Mazda 6.] as you can see, the automatic is rated higher than the manual. Finally, the point that manuals make you more focused and overall a better driver. I feel that I spend enough time trying to maintain my speed, making sure no one is in my blind spots, maintaining a reasonable distance between the car in front of me, and trying to pay attention to road signs. Having to pay attention to yet another gage seems very unappealing to me. The last point I'd like to address is that riding in a manual as a passenger can actually make me carsick. Unless the person is super good at shifting, (and let's face it, they never are) the car lurches back and fourth and makes me want to puke. I'd rather ride in an automatic where cars generally don't do that! In the advent of self driving cars, I just don't see much of a reason to learn how to drive a manual. Can anyone change my view?
