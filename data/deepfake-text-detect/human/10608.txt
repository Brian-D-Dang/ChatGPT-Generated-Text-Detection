No matter where you hear it, which studies it's taken from, or when it may have happened, there is no such thing as spot weight loss. The body breaks down fat wherever the mind chooses. It varies from person to person, and from time to time, and cannot be dictated by a certain workout, diet, or pill.,It depend on your genetics. Your body will store fat in specific spots, then others as fa body fat increases. Where fat accumulates first is where fat disappear last because your body has preferences to where fat should be stored. Most people store fat in the belly area first (love handles typically) and the face comes later, if you belong to this majority then fat should disappear in your facial and neck area first
