People who have no interest in politics, and are not interested in learning about the candidates and issues should not be encouraged to vote under the pretense that it its their "patriotic duty" or that they are "supposed to." I believe it is the duty of all citizens eligible for voting to do so, but only as informed citizens. If they are unwilling to become informed, they should not be encouraged to vote. Please note that this does not mean that their right to vote should be infringed, simply that other people should not encourage them to do so. EDIT: to clarify what I would consider the standard to be for a low information voter: Someone who has watched none of the various political debates leading up to the election, and cannot differentiate what major policiesbeliefs are traditionally associated with which party.
