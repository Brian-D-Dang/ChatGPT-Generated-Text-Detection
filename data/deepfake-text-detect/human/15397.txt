We stopped by here for a dessert after Fuddruckers and they were offering ice cream cupcakes. I thought it was going to be some elaborate way of creating a ice cream cupcake but they opened up a tupperware that had little ice cream scoops and just plopped it on a open cupcake top and filled it with cream on top to cover the ice cream. Umm, ok. What a cheap way to make a so-called ice cream cupcake'.
