Total side note, but there was a place like this where I grew up. It served nothing but cheese or pepperoni pizza, and it stayed open super late. There was no sign outside indicating what it even was. It literally just had a neon OPEN sign in a dusty window. Inside, it was lit by a single edison bulb. This was back in 2008, before edison bulbs were hip. Cash only, of course. Long story short, it looked like what everyone assumed it to be a drug front. Of course, we had no way of proving it. Anyway, I was back in town during the summer of my freshman year of college. Some friends and I got hammered and stopped in around midnight for a pie. They were like 5. Rather shady looking guy comes in and orders a meatball sub or something clearly not on the menu. I'm seated facing the cashier. He eyeballs the guy, and in a rather loud voice says, "That'll be 50." Customer drops a 50 on the counter without blinking. The cashier looks at the bill, looks at the guy and then at me. Then the guy turns around and looks at me. My friends and I got up and basically ran out. They turned the "OPEN" sign off right after we left. Place was incredibly shady, but for 5 you couldn't really beat it.
