The thing that keeps your skin "moist" and supple is actually the naturally occuring oils that your skin produces. If you bathe too much or use harsh soaps or maybe alcohol cleansers, these remove the oils from your skin. Whatever water is in your skin then evaporates dry skin. Thats what moisturizing cremes do. They not only add more water back to your skin, but they also add natural oils to keep the water in.','Drinking water lets your body process the fluids and make natural oils to keep the skin from drying. If you just put water on your skin it washes away the oils, kind of doing the opposite.
