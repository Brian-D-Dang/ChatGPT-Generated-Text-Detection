The aluminum (or steel, but aluminum is more common) the can is made of is very thin, so when it's "unshaken" and you hold it, it heats up to the same temperature as your hand very quick. But when you shake it, you're basically covering the inside with shaving cream, so now the heat can move from your hand, through the aluminum (aluminum is an excellent conductor of heat) and into the shaving cream. More mass to hold heat also means that more heat can be transferred from your hand, thus making it feel colder.
