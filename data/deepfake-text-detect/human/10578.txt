If you look at the pump, it has a small chamber, and when you pump the soap, along with some air, is forced through small holes in that chamber, then up and out of the nozzle. The soap itself is also pretty thin and watery; if you took normal hand soap and put that in a foaming soap's container it wouldn't foam up.
