Apple is planning to build its own in-house technology and infrastructure for financial services. Financial services are a rapidly growing part of Apple's overall product strategy. Developing these services will help Apple create more consistent recurring revenue from customers. Apple is working on payment processing, risk assessment for lending, fraud analysis, credit checks, and additional customer-service functions. The company is preparing to release a pay later feature and hardware subscription bundle to which these new plans will likely apply.
