To clarify, I believe that animals have a consciousness that plants etc do not have, and this should not be ended. This goes beyond simply the ending of life, as it can be argued that plants are 'alive', but instead the ending of life that is aware of itself, and its surrounding world. I am okay with eating plants and non meat products because they do not have consciousness. I myself am a vegetarian for these reasons and am open to changing my views if someone can make a sound argument against this. Change my view on vegetarianism.
