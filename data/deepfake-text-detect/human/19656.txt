I believe the United States and other countries should end their biofuel subsidies, which do little to help the environment, and only serve as a way of propping up domestic agriculture. The subsidies are unsustainable, and come at the cost of greatly inflating food prices (which affects the world's poor more than anything). This report finds that subsidies to biofuels were between 5.5 billion and 7.3 billion in 2005. Those figures are expected to grow significantly if current policies remain in place, as the bulk of biofuels subsidies are tied to output and output is increasing at double-digit rates of growth. The report finds that biofuels are an extremely high-cost means for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. Under optimistic projections, it costs some 500 in federal and state subsidies to reduce one metric ton of CO2-equivalent through the production and use of corn-based ethanol. Moreover, the sheer levels of government support to biofuels appear out of proportion to their ability to satisfy domestic transport-fuel requirements. Current forecasts are that biofuels would account for less than 5 percent of total transport fuel use in 2010. [Source] . This website has similar conclusions from their reports on various countries. EDIT: I would like to add that I oppose agricultural subsidies in general. So feel free to CMV on that if you don't want to restrict yourself to biofuel. Hello, users of CMV!
