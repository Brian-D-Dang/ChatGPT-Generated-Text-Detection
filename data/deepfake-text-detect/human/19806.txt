From the moment it was announced that North Korea had threatened attacks against theaters who showed The Interview, it hasn't sounded right to me. It just seems a whole lot more likely that the threats were made by an Anonymous-type group with an anti-corporate agenda than by the tightly sealed, xenophobic police state of NK. supposedly the FBI has evidence that the threat emanated from within NK, but it also seems to me that the players involved would mostly benefit from the public seeing the culprit as NK rather than a domestic hacker cell, so i find the FBI's announcement unconvincing. i realize how conspiracy theory this sounds, to say that the FBI is somehow intentionally misleading us. but it's also possible that hackers use proxy walls in NK as part of a way to hide their tracks, and that this practice would just make it easier to blame it on state actors in NK. so Reddit, CMV! can anyone formulate a convincing argument for me as to why i should believe it's NK doing it and not an Anonymous-style group?
