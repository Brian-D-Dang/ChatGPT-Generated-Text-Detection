The universe exists, and came in to being somehow. Some claim that we don't know yet exactly how the universe came in to being, we know roughly when it did, and roughly how it did, but what caused it to come in to being is a unanswered question - one we may never answer. There are others that believe God brought the Universe in to being (that is, an all powerful entity was the first-mover, setting the universe in motion). But if God is all powerful and infinite, we have no idea what HisHerits nature is, and couldn't possibly know, as mortal, finite beings. What is the difference between saying we don't know how the universe came in to being, and saying that this entity that we don't know the nature of, and couldn't possibly comprehend, brought the universe in to being? Aren't they equally nebulous beliefs? How does believing that God brought the universe in to being differentiate your beliefs from those who would say we don't know how the universe was brought in to being? Aren't they pretty much the same belief? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
