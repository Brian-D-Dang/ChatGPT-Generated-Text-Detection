We went to Mix with a party of eight to celebrate my friend's 30th birthday. While the views and the interior of the restaurant were amazing, the food and service left much to be desired. To begin with, the hostess didn't ask if we'd prefer to sit inside or outside. We ended up sitting outside...the heat and the altitude began to make us all feel nauseated. I also made the mistake of wearing heels to the restaurant...the floor of the patio was like a deck and my heel kept getting stuck in the floor. Also, every time someone walked by the table, it felt like the floor was shaking (wish I would have known to bring dramamine to dinner). When the waiter came to our table he asked if we had a show to attend. We should have said yes as this might have lead to quicker service. We ended up not ordering wine or cocktails for the table (due to the nausea), and the waiter seemed to write our table off. After we placed our food order, it took an hour for dinner to come. While the food (when it did come) wasn't terrible, it definitely wasn't worth the 90person we ended up spending. The waiter didn't come to check on us at all throughout the meal. He even spent 20 minutes flirting with some girls at the table next to us while we were waiting for our bill. When we complained to the manager at the end of the meal, he asked why we didn't come speak with him since he was outside the whole time. I don't know about your experiences, but in other restaurants, the manager usually circulates and checks on each table themselves rather than waiting for diners to come up to them. One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. I will definitely not be going back to Mix.
