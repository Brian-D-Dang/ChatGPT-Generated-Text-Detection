By the opening of the 2008 General Conference, total UMC membership was estimated at 11.4 million, with about 7.9 million in the U.S. and 3.5 million overseas. Significantly, about 20 of the conference delegates were from Africa, with Filipinos and Europeans making up another 10. During the conference, the delegates voted to finalize the induction of the Methodist Church of the Ivory Coast and its 700,000 members into the denomination. Given current trends in the UMC - with overseas churches growing, especially in Africa, and U.S. churches collectively losing about 1,000 members a week - it has been estimated that Africans will make up at least 30 of the delegates at the 2012 General Conference, and it is also possible that 40 of the delegates will be from outside the U.S. One Congolese bishop has estimated that typical Sunday attendance of the UMC is higher in his country than in the entire United States.
