It's a supervolcano. It does the same thing as a volcano, but at a larger scale. It will spew ash for thousands of miles which causes obvious chaos. But more importantly, it will damage crops, etc - which is the devastating part. I read somewhere that it has the potential of covering whole states in several feet of ash, which would kill animals, plants, damage properties, etc.
