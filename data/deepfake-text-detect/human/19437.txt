So speaking generally, the phrase "I could care less" is often used to express somebody being apathetic to a certain topic, item, etc. The phrase itself implies that there is some level of caring (if we are to quantifying caring) that falls below the amount of caring that the person gives at that point in time. This, in effect, states that the person actually does care, and thus is ineffective in its purpose. By contrast, the phrase "I couldn't care less" is a much more elegant solution which properly expresses that the person saying it is not able to care any less than they already do, thus effectively stating that they absolutely do not care. This is something that has always bothered me, and every time somebody says the expression, I find myself despising the lack of logic. Please, CMV. Hello, users of CMV!
