In both circumstances, one is in bondage. One cannot leave to pursue other employment options, and one must work for the benefit of others or be punished. One could potentially argue that prisoners "deserve" it while slaves do not, but with the amount of false accusations, wrongful convictions, and victimless crimes, that argument is IMO tenuous at best. Other than that, I can't think of a single way in which being a prisoner in a jurisdiction where it is legal to force prisoners to work involuntarily for no wage or negligible wages is different from being a slave CMV.
