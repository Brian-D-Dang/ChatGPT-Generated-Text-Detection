For sustainable growth and profitability, online game companies are constantly carrying out various events to attract new game users, to maximize return users, and to minimize churn users in online games. Because minimizing churn users is the most cost-effective method, many pieces of research are being conducted on ways to predict and to prevent churns in advance. However, there is still little research on the validity of event effects. In this study, we investigate whether game events influence the user churn rate and confirm the difference in how game users respond to events by character level, item purchasing frequency and game-playing time band.
