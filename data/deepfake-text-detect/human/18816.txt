Aside from the massive pressure for women to be painfully thin, sometimes to the point of eating disorders, there exists, particularly in the top-flight, a culture where dancers are expected to flirt with and even sleep with directors for top parts, even where their talent alone merits consideration. Bribery is also common, with young dancers saying they're forced out of bigger companies because they simply cannot afford the sort of money which changes hands to secure roles. Then there's the injuries which can end careers, the arthritis and joint problems, the deformed toes and feet caused by years of dancing. So, can someone please change my view as to how ballet is art?
