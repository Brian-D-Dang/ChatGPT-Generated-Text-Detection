America has participated in almost every Middle Eastern conflict in the past 20 or so years. Wars fought for questionable reasons, almost always with a gain to the US. But more importantly, wars employing 2 million soldiers, a million civilians and last but not least, countless contractors, weapons manufacturers and PMC companies. If America stopped waging war, a sizable part of its industry would fail. A country which spends 20 of its annual budget on military enterprises, cannot stop its military machine. This of course is not an excuse for what America has done in the past in the name of the "War on Terror," for example. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
