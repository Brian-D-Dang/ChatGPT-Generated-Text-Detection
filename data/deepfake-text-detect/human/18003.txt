(note, please set aside health issues. I think it's going to confuse the debate but if you MUST... then go for it). I think that not eating meat is cruel.. specifically NOT eating lamb, chicken, pork, etc. Further, they must be killed in a humane manner (as humane as possible). The one point I want to bring up ahead of time is that the animals MUST be respected and not abused and given a good life. This specifically excludes factory farming which I don't support. There are basically three choices for an animal: - the animal can not be born - the animal could live in the wild - the animal could be raised on a farm I think it's better for the animal to exist. It gets to enjoy its life... which , as long as it isn't causing too much harm, is generally a good thing. This means it could live on a farm, or in the wild. It's MUCH better for an animal to live on the farm. It receives medical treatment (though basic by human standards). Protection from predators. A reliable source of food. Protection from the weather, etc. The ONE tradeoff here is that one it reaches a mature age, it's killed and sold for meat. I think this is a fair trade off. Further, I think it's MORE ethical for these animals to exist. And the money to pay for them has to come from somewhere which is from the market ... The alternative is to live wild. If you have objections to killing an animal in captivity, how do you feel about them dying in the wild? Starvation, predation, disease. These aren't fun ways to die. So in conclusion. It's far better for everyone involved to eat
