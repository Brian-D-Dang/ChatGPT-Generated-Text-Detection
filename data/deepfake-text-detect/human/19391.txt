In a world with limited resources, it seems to me that spending time and money to take care of animals is immoral when those resources could be used to help humans in need. I think that stray animals should be euthanized and disposed of. With the money we save from getting rid of animal shelters we could build more housing for the homeless or impoverished. I don't hate animals, I just think that their lives are worth less compared with those of human beings. I still want to deal with animals humanely, but not at the cost of letting humans go without food or shelter.
