Consider this- there is no substantial likelihood of any survivors. The crash occurred 19 days ago. The cost of searching and finding the bodies of the deceased is unlikely to be justified by any substantial learning about the safety of airplanes. We should assume the people are lost, the plane sank to the bottom of the ocean, which is the foremost conclusion, and move on with our lives as a planet. The taxpayer burden of Australians paying their military to fly 1600 miles round trip for the chance of finding bodies and records of the flight is vastly wasteful. People who fly accept the risk of travel and this is one of them. Right now, we are spending millions of dollars to satisfy the worlds morbid curiosity.
