It's widely accepted that parents cause a child's "bad" behavior in one way or another. Even if the parent doesn't interact too much with him, it's still a gesture that affects him. If they abuse him, or hug him, it's still a factor that molds the child. I've read an article a few months ago saying it is a common thing for kids to develop violent behavior if their parents are "overly kind" or something like that, which may sound like an irrational statement, but, it's still a factor. Since children spend most of their time with their parents (or guardians), they are directly affected by them. So external factors like peer pressure are not as powerful, but just distractions, or temporary things, whereas childhood experiences stay with them for their entire life. So are parents solely (or at least mostly) responsible, or is something else like peer pressure or the media just as important?
