I tried to make her happy. She was beautiful, kind. In the beginning, she saw me for what I was and what I could be, and she loved me for it. I thought we could be the ones that everyone else was jealous of the ones still in love at 80, despite all the pain the world could throw at us. We were happy together once. Until the world stopped fighting us and we started fighting each other. First the long talks about strategy stopped. Then the intimacy dried up. Her brilliant jewel of a mind was locked away from me, no matter how I tried to bring it back. She was angry, then cold, then indifferent. It was only a matter of time. He said he loved me. That we could have a life together, a good life. One that would shine as a beacon to those looking for love. So we conquered the world together. But slowly I realized that he never loved me he never even knew who I was. I could explain all I wanted to about the anger of poverty, the joy of escaping it. He wouldn't know the pain of losing your religion, and then your family. Not that I wanted him to. But when I tried to build the kind of deep connection that I craved, the kind I used to have, it always turned out one sided. I was lonelier than I had ever been even when I wasn't alone. It was only a matter of time.
