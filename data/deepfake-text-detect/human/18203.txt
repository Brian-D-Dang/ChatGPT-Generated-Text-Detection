As much as "bad" (what is commonly seen to be shallow, over-produced or mindless, often found in the Top 40) music is reviled by music critics and music appreciators, I believe it can be genuinely enjoyed and is important. Instead of agreeing with many, who think that "bad" music should be eliminated or otherwise filtered out in place of more critically acclaimed music, it can be celebrated without irony. My reasoning: - Music should not be censored (arguably aside from music promotes ideas like pedophilia, racial violence and so on). - Almost all music can have something to offer, even if you personally do not see it. - Any music has the potential to promote feelings, even Lil Jon - If you happen to sincerely enjoy the latest Miley Cyrus song, then you should feel free to twerk as much as your butt desires. I do think that the current music industry has an extreme power imbalance and that smaller artists don't get the chance that they should have to promote their music. It's not fair - but neither is it fair to degrade more popular, perhaps less critically acclaimed music and its fans. I hope this makes sense (feel free to point out flaws) - it's my first post ever. I look forward to your replies. I'd also love to see if anyone agrees! No offense, Lil Jon.
