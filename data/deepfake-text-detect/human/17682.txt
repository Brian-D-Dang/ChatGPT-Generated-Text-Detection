My office just installed automatic soap and paper towel dispensers in the restrooms. While I can understand the benefits of not having to touch the towel dispenser to dry my hands, I can't get behind automatic soap. First, they often have trouble identifying my desire for soap, leading me to frantically wave my hand at varying distances from the robot dispenser (as well as in front of the dispensers associated with adjacent sinks) and wonder how something that was just installed is already broken. Second, even if this automatic dispenser saves me from having to physically touch the device and thereby contact the deposited germs of those with whom I share this facility, my very next act is almost certainly to WASH MY HANDS. As a result, nearly any contamination that could result from my physical contact with a soap dispenser would subsequently be literally washed away. Please help me understand how automatic soap dispensers do anything but waste time (trying to get the thing to see me waving at it) and money (replacing simple, low-cost conventional dispensers) only to solve a problem that largely doesn't exist (unchecked contamination from push-to-dispense devices).
