I celebrated my boyfriends 30th in Vegas so we came here for small bites. I found out they have a Happy Hour on Oysters- 1.75 each instead of 2.75. Boy were they good! We each had a dozen and corked a bottle of Champagne. The corkage fee is 50, so beware. And if they have your particular bottle in stock, you will not be able to cork it! I got lucky- Vintage 2004 Don Perignon was not in stock- hehe. We loved the experience here and the beautiful view of the Lake waterfall. The complementary bread basket they provide is to die for! Our server was extremely attentive and kind- I wish I knew her name. She was great!
