I'm in a foreign country for a few weeks, and this weekend I went clubbing with some other people from my program. We got very drunk and danced, which included grinding. I don't think I should tell my partner for several reasons: 1) It's not going to happen again; I'm returning home in a few days and I only go out with my partner in my home country. 2) I'm in agreement with Dan Savage's idea that confessing to cheating is more about absolution for the guilty party than emotional consideration for the person who was cheated on. There's no risk of disease from grinding; telling my partner about it would just upset them with no possible benefit. Why upset them over this?
