I feel that mankind is either going to succumb to a fatal pandemic before we get the opportunity to travel to distant worlds. That the people in charge are not seeing the true benefit in finding another habitable planet. That humans are too busy killing each other and endlessly warring over increasingly worthless things to turn their attention to the rest of the galaxy. I can't help but feel that no one in power is at all interested in a future past the planet Earth. I feel that while there is some interest in space, there is by far not enough being done by any one country.
