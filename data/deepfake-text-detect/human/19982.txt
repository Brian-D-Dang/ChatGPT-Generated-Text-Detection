1. The second and third book kind of suck. The second was basically the same as the first, and the third was just katniss being emo and whiny the whole time. 2. The whole idea of the reaping and the games are far-fetched. Not only are there easier and more productive ways of punishing a people for a war, but with the games there would be huge human-rights and ethics issues that even people in the capitol would protest. 3. The story isn't very original (see: battle royale, the long walk, etc) 4. The "love triangle" between katniss, gale, and peeta is extremely contrived and forced 5. The game masters or whatever they are called seem more like plot devices to move the story along faster (by creating fires and stuff to move people closer together). If this was in a real game show, there would be complaints that it was fake and fixed. I do respect the series for getting many young people to read, but I don't see what the fuss is about.
