Currently birth certificates are needed to get other forms of identification such as drivers licenses and passports. They contain the facts of your birth such as date, location and name. But they do not identify you as a person because they do not currently have biometric data. They are relied on by just possession. If you possess a birth certificate it is presumed to be your birth certificate. This is why they are not given out to anyone who requests a copy. If you lose your birth certificate and all other forms of identification it is hard to get new copies. To avoid these problems a blood sample could be taken at birth and a DNA signature determined. Later when you need to get a photo identification then all that is needed is a new blood sample and your photo. Asking your name would not even be necessary but could just be used to speed up a match. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
