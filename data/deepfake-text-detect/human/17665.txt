I am referring not to abstract beliefs, such as "do unto others . . .," but to the actually stories found in this religion. I have restricted this to Christianity for the sake of simplicity (although I was not raised as a Christian). Christianity stipulates that if you believe (or place your faith) in what they teach you will benefit in some way. What they teach is fabricated; for instance, it is not possible for someone to walk on water, for a sea to be parted at will, or for someone to live for a while inside a whale (excuse the water motif in these examples). Every single mentally competent person knows that these things are impossible without having to think about it. If someone were to say that their car keys spontaneously metamorphosed into John Madden, no one else would even consider that it might have actually happened (you might consider that they meant it in an allegorical way, though). You couldn't literally believe it if you tried; you could only pretend (to yourself andor to others) that you believe in it. I believe that Christians tacitly understand they are only pretending to believe in those religious stories. The "benefit" alluded to earlier is essentially the benefit of fitting in with Christian society, where everyone agrees to pretend they believe in those things. CMV.
