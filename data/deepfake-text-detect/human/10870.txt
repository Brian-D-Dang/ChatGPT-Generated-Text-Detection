You answered yourself when you said "foreign words." Words coming from a foreign language come as neologisms, which in time derivate into something else that becomes part of the main language, although not necessarily. The process, in the case of the English language, is called Anglicisation. Think that in the beginning people said "Kobenhavn," but as it started getting used more often people started sayingwriting it as "Copenhagen" because.... well, it's obviously easier!
