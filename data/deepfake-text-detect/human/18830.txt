Living in a major international city and in my twenties, I am no longer convinced that my female peers are, all things considered and evened out, the disadvantaged group anymore. Yes there are some areas these educated sophisticated and capable young ladies have it worse than us guys but consider this: Recently I was room hunting, close to half of the ads explicitly or, after going for a visit, implicitly prefer females, for no reason other than the supposed idea than guys are messier (I will happily dispute that , professional guys at least will not have 1000 bottles scattered in the bathroom) Interns. I fortunately had been through that phrase, but I can guarantee you even in the traditional male dominated arena of politics and international organizations, the softer female touch (I suppose) is now allowing the incoming class to be also disproportionately female. Educational attainment , of female in law medicine MBAs , now all have female majorities. And yet somehow, and I know you girls here will disapprove, but yet we guys are still somehow supposed to be the girls' "marrying up" scheme. The have it both way mentality (selective application of equality and traditional gender role) is not prevalent but not uncommon among my female cohort, thus putting pressure on us guys through the dating market. You may say there is still no female US president; under-representation of women in the boardroom and etc, but I would argue that, in terms of the individual welfare of our age group, these stats are as inconsequential and
