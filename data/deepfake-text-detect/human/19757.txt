Currently in the US, a felony conviction carries with it the loss of voting rights. This is true in prison, as well as after your release. Just because a person commits a crime doesn't mean that they are not a member of our society or that their opinion about the direction our country is headed should be forfeit. Further, there is an issue of de facto racism involved. For a variety of reasons, the felony conviction rate per capita among African Americans is much higher than it is among whites. This means that a higher percentage of African Americans have lost their right to vote. That may not have been the intention to start off with, but that is a side effect of the system. Lastly, the number of members of the house and the districts they represent are decided by population head counts. This includes prison populations, which means that a Representative may have a district which contains a small town with a large prison. Their voting base would be only a small percentage of the population they represent, a small percentage which would have a decidedly different opinion on issues like crime than the majority of the population. Now, I will concede that someone who is convicted of a crime like "voter fraud" or "voter intimidation" could be banned from participating in that they've proven to be a danger to the system. However, a 65 year old who robbed a liquor store when he was 23 should have just as much to say about who will be the next President as anyone else.
