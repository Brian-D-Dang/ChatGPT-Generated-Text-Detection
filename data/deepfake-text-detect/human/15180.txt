I hate writing bad reviews but this seriously warrants it. Maybe other Lowes are better but this particular store just fails. Management hides behind their employees and don't own up to their mistakes of which with my delivery there were multiple. They forgot our delivery and while I waited all day no one from Lowes call about it. Then after I called, they said they forgot to load my units on the truck and they rescheduled my delivery. When they did show up the units they were going to deliver were damaged and undeliverable. They delivery guys said they'd get us new units that day or the next. After waiting 24 hrs for a call from Lowes, I called and was told it won't be in till Wednesday. Well I wasted another day waiting around for a delivery that didn't come. Absolutely no management took responsibility for the mistakes, it was all'this wasn't my mistake' or'I'm just finding out about this'. Absolutely no one was going to call me it seems instead they were find just taking my money. I know its a hardware store but seriously when someone gives you money principle dictates you give them their purchase.
