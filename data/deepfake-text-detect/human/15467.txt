I'm going to write one last review on FastMed, as if the two previous ones weren't clear enough. Yes, I had an incredibly horrible experience there...fine, lesson learned. I found the PA's behavior reprehensible and I now know not to walk foot in that place again. I took all the right steps to make them aware of my experience there, I emailed Dr. Williams, who is the Founder, President CEO of FastMed. He did reply and said he would look into the issue and apologized for the bad experience. He then sent another email saying he forwarded my complaint to the Medical Director in Az and said I would be contacted shortly, that was 11 days ago,I have not been contacted. I also called my insurance company and filed a complaint with them and was advised to also file a complaint with the Medical Board of Az. I am not looking to get the PA fired, which I know wouldn't happen, nor am I trying to smear her name...I just want her to realize that each patient is an individual. I know Urgent Care is exactly what it claims to be, it's a fast solution to a medical problem after hours. I wasn't expecting her to take the same exact care my family doctor does, but I was expecting her to clearly look at my history, examine the issue, ask questions and of course advise me accordingly. She failed to do so in a professional manner and just to be a complete and utter jerk she throws insults at me in front of my 2 children. Whatever her issue was with me, right or wrong, her bedside manner was disgusting and I will never forget that day I was treated like scum at FastMed Urgent Care.
