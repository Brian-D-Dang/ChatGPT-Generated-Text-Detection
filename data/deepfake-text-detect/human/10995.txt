The amendments to the constitution largely dictate what the government isn't allowed to do. A privately owned business is not an entity of the government and therefore exempt from those restrictions. I could open a business and kick out anyone who has a certain religious belief because it's my private property. Of course, my business would likely suffer for it, but it wouldn't be illegal.
