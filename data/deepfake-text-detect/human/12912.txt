"I don't believe it Bill," Jeff whispered, his flashlight pointed on the stone fatman. "Neither do I Jeff," Bill squinted, trying to make out the details on the rounded face. "You think it's a joke?" Jeff took a few cautionary steps towards the statue, making sure not to slip down the crater. "Like, do you think someone just set some explosives and left it for us to find? I mean, it is sitting perfectly..." Bill looked over his companion incredulously. "Jeff, we both saw that thing come crashing down from the sky, saw the burning grass and clumps of dirt shoot into the air, there's no way this is a joke" Bill chose not to follow his friend, instead throwing small bits of rock at the statue. "Hey! it's got a swastika on it! This things a Nazi!" Jeff frantically looked around, trying to find a culprit. "What? It's a Buddha, I heard that he used that symbol waaay before Hitler got it" Bill stepped forward slightly trying to get a clearer look. "Yeah, but did they have German and shit written on them? I actually think it's wearing a uniform, this is some sort of space Nazi Buddha!" Jeff ran back up the crater wall to drag Bill down, "come on, look!" "Do you really..... really think that there are space Nazi's throwing Buddhas down from the sky? Jeff, learn to think about the situation. Some kids probably messed around with a statue and set it up, it's fine" Bill threw his arms up and sighed, tired of ordeal. Jeff too sighed, and moved out of the crater. "Yeah..... I guess you're right, let's leave it for now and grab it tomorrow." Bill nodded at the suggestion and the two made back towards their home. In the dust of their footsteps, an ominous glow was emitted, as the Buddhas eye's blinked open with a malicious grin. Standing at his full height, the pacifist racist let out a bellowing laugh. Phase one had ended.
