Every so often a story will be on rworldnews about a poacher who killed an elephant or something and act as if they are the devil. Poachers in third world country's likely do it because they have no other option to make money, and compared to other illegal activities, like human trafficking, it seems a lot less severe in terms of immorality. The majority of westerners also eat factory farmed meat which kills far more animals than poachers ever will. Instead of just being angry and poachers and sending them to prison, we should focus on giving them a more stable economy where they can have an alternative, legal career. Hello, users of CMV!
