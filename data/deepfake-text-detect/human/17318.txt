I am rereading the Hobbit as an adult, and actually reading the poetry that I found too painful to read the first two times I read it as a teen. I'm no literature expert, nor an expert on poetry, but it just seems bad. And, it also seems endless. It's like, "Oh no, the Dwarves are singing again, oh no, now it's the Orcs, now it's the Wood-elves." And to top it off, since it all rhymes, it forces me to think that the story isn't being told in English as a convenience. Instead, all these ancient races are all really speaking modern English, which seem far-fetched. EDIT: WOW, I'm really, really, REALLY surprised I changed my mind on this. I don't particular like the poetry, still, but I see how it fits in with deeper understanding of the Bilbo, the writer. EDIT 2: I also concede that Tolkien was trying to capture a historic style, not just writing what just writing stuff that turned out to annoy me. And knowing Tolkien conceived of a lingua franca amongst the various groups makes viewing the songs as translations seem believable. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
