There has been a ton of posts on tipping and whether it should be required or not. Some of the reasons to tip include for excellent service and (in the US) due to way the federal minimum wage law is set. In brief, the federal minimum wage is set at 7.25, however, for servers and people that are likely to receive tips, the minimum wage is set at 2.13. This is done in anticipation that tips will make up the difference (at the very least) in terms of their hourly wage to keep them above the 7.25 limit. [Recent changes] in california state law have changed the minimum wage of servers to 9 irrespective of tipping. That is to say, if restaurants are paying servers less then 9hour excluding tips, they are breaking the law. Due to this shift in the fundamental nature of compensation, I feel that in California, we should switch to the tipping norms found in Europe and many asian countries, that is to say tipping is not required. If you feel that you have received excellent service you are more then welcome to tip, but there should be no societal obligation anymore. CMV.
