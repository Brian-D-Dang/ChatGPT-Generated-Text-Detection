A 'normal' district often has a very diverse population. They often contain a number of different social groups. richpoor, liberalconservative, suburbanrural and so on. that means that any representative elected by such a district is highly unlikely to actually represent the entire district, that is it's likely that a large portion of those living in the district would have liked someone else. that means that in a non-gerrymandering system there are a large number of people that simply go unrepresented. a large number of people that are simply left voiceless. Gerrymandering, as silly as it is, solves this problem. by creating the most homogenous selection of people possible it ensures that a much bigger percentage of voters actually get the representative that they want. I therefor think that Gerrymandering is a GOOD thing that helps us all get a government that actually represents the people. . Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
