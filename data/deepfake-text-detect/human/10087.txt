I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too many to list, but the big ones are: Cities have significantly better municipal services. The difference is night and day. Cities have bigger and better libraries, schools, policefire departments, hospitals, gas, internet, and so on and so forth. As 4G LTE rolls out, I can tell you exactly who's going to get it first. Everything about this makes city life so much safer and more comfortable. Everything is closer in the city, and there is a greater range of things to do. A really small town will have one or two general-purpose shops. Cities can have huge malls filled with stores and restaurants of all varieties. There are theatres and large public events and strip clubs and meetings of like-minded people and clubs and just about anything to do if you ever get bored. There's a convenience store on just about every corner. Cities afford a degree of pseudo-anonymity. If you move into an apartment building, lolwhocares. If you move into the country you've got a ton of people who have a new neighbor that they wanna get to know and everything. Even if you abstain from social interaction, you become "that weird neighbor that abstains from social interaction." This tends to temper individualism, and it's not like you can "just spend time with the people you like," because rumors and all travel fast with a community that small. bugs holy fucking shit the bugs aaaaaaaaa In the country, everything is high maintenance. Since just about everything that isn't a tractor was designed to operate in a man-made environment, everything keeps getting dirty and breaking. Cars and houses and electronics and appliances and furniture all need to be repaired andor replaced noticeably more frequently than they would in the city.
