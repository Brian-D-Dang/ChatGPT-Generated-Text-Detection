because everybody assumes that you're straight, so you need to announce that you are gay this is.... not a complex concept,It's a fact that the majority of individuals identify as heterosexual. It's not a value statement; it's just the way things are. [I looked here] (URL0) It's logical to assume, without additional knowledge, that someone you know is heterosexual. It's like if you had a coin that, when you flipped it, came up heads about 90 of the time. If you had to guess what the outcome on the next flip would be, you'd guess "heads." There would be an element of surprise if the coin came up tails. So, if someone wants to show the world who they are, and that person happens to be homosexual, it's almost required to "come out" in some way to counter the default assumption that they are heterosexual. It would be nice if no one made assumptions one way or the other, but until we get to that level of enlightenment, coming out will be necessary.', "Homosexuals are still badly persecuted in most cultures and are in a fight for their civil rights. Straight is the norm and has nothing to defend itself from. As a female you know what it is to have to work around some people's small minds. Imagine if we all carried our gender internally so it could be hidden from the public. However, once people found out that you were a female you would be relegated to second class status. Good reason to stay hidden, but once those people start to unite and fight to raise their status it can become a source of pride to come out and declare who you are and what you are fighting for.
