i will try not to rage and be open, but it is hard. so according to what i know, reddit doesn't allow hate speech subreddits (i might be completely wrong) (edit 1: yes i am completely wrong). but those subreddits are clear hate speech. "Hate speech is speech that attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes" (from Wikipedia). and the subreddit is basically that, judges attacks a group in the basis of an attribute. i actually decided to be passive aggressive and wrote a summary about hate speech. and i got this comment "Hate speech laws don't apply to hate speech against Bronies because legally speaking they aren't considered people. They're actually classed as livestock, ironically like ponies are.." have no idea what else to talk about. i am actually open to somebody convincing me why it is NOT hate speech. edit 2: for all of you saying that hate speech is only towards protected groups. it is only usually towards protected groups. and the definition claims that it is towards any group.
