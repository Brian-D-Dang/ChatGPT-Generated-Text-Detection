Hey, im having a slight moral dilemma. Sometimes I come across moments when I want to complain about how bad my life is or about "first world problems" but I tell myself that there are always others who may have it worse, therefore I don't have the "right to complain" about my problems. An example is like of a typical teen complaining about whats for dinner, whilst a mother retorts, he should be happy he has dinner in the first place. Or, having a literally shitty work day but concluding that hey its better than living without work at all. Is this a morally correct view? Is it something a 15yrold should even consider? Am I thinking too hard?
