The plumber ran from the unfamiliar; seven foot tall extra terrestrials gave chase. They grunted and groaned like nothing he'd ever heard. He was in the subway when one showed up, causing everyone to run into the tunnel. Vinnie stared the alien in it's eyes before it blasted him with it's weapon. As he ran away he tasted the familiar water that covered his body. The creatures must not have done their homework if they assume that will hurt humans. But they are still big and scary so he didn't want to take any chances. He ducked into a service area and peeked back at the pursuers. Tall lanky scaled beasts with six legs. Some of them were blue, others green, with some in between. Their eyes were impossibly huge and their teeth looked like doctor's needles. He saw a child hiding in plain sight, right in the path of the aliens. Vinnie wanted to do something to help but he's just a plumber, what does he know? The creatures picked the child up and hissed in its face. They proceeded to lick the child's entire head before leaving it behind. When the coast was clear he approached the silent kid. "Hey Kid are you ok?" "I'm ok, just smell like fish now is all," said the little girl.
