If you think about it, you can block anyone on anything. iPhone? iOS 7 ships with a blocking feature. If you don't have an iPhone, blocking communication with any number is just a phone call to your carrier. Twitter? Facebook? Any other social media site? They all have blocking features. However, if for some reason you can't block them, EVERY electronic device has a power button. I don't want to get into the "everything is considered bullying argument" today. That is for another thread on another day. I just think this can solve the cyberbullying "epidemic" that the news and other media make it out to be. Remember, we are talking STRICTLY cyberbullying. I know I sound like an asshole. So, please, change my view.
