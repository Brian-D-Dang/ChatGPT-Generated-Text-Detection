Established directors have established styles. If you got Tim Burton to direct a movie it would be a Tim Burton movie first and a marvel movie second. They are shooting for a marvel house style that is consistent across the whole cinematic universe, and they can't get that from directors that have already found their own groove. Even if there was a director they liked, he wouldn't have time to direct every marvel movie, and if he did he would wield an outrageous and dangerous amount of power with the studio. Established directors also have more bargaining power. If a famous director can negotiate a percentage of the box office take, that's a lot of money for a movie that grosses a billion dollars. Tldr: New directors are willing to do what they're told and take a paycheck. Established directors want creative input and a much much bigger paycheck.," "It's true that they had literally no experience with action films.
