I may have my info wrong, but my understanding is this: If I think a stock is going to lose value soon, I can "sell" shares of that company which I do not own, then "buy" them back later at a lower price to balance my sheet. Here are my issues: First, no one should be allowed to sell anything they do not own. Second, this is a huge draw for insider trading. Third, this causes a pile-on effect where a company might take a hit for a bad quarter, but now it's taking a much bigger hit because shorters are trying to drive down the price. Lastly, it can lead to a ridiculous scenario in which more stocks are for sale than actually exist. Example (and yes it's an exaggeration for clarity): An oil company has a massive spill. Everyone gets spooked. Owners of 70 of the shares dump it on the market, driving the price from 80 to 15. But with shorting, in addition to the 70 of the shares getting sold, another 50 of "short" shares are being sold. Now, 120 of the stocks are for sale and another 30 of the shares are held by people who aren't selling. That's 150
