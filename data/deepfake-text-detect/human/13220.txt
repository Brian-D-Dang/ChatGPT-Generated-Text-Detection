So I'm here groaning right? This dude thinks that if I kill him the "agonizing pain" will stop, but is that really the case? Nah! I just want to waste his ass for the sake of it. Does this make me a bad person? Probably not, but I think people will miss him for sure. He seems like a nice dude, light beard coming on, stylish, and pretty friendly from the looks of it (and the fact he already hasn't screeched and ran away) So I ask him what he's got going and he says he works at a local grocery store, "real organic stuff" he's going steady and will soon be married to his fiance, Emily. Lives in a cozy apartment and lives a modest life. I stare at him and give him a glance of a thousand words and then I chomp that motherfucker down.
