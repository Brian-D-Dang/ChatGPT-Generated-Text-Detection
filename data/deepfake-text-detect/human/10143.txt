Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, is it looked down on and dismissed as anecdotal evidence for someone to share an experience of theirs? I quite enjoy listening to anecdotal evidence to get new perspectives I wouldn't have thought of or haven't heard before. I understand that in an anecdotal case it is not scientific because it cannot be replicated and held to control standards, but I don't think this is grounds for dismissing the case as merely anecdotal and not worth mentioning. Am I wrong about this? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things. Firstly, please remember to [read through our rules] .
