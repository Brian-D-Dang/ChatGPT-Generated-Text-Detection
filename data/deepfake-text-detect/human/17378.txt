So I have been thinking about this one for a while. There is one intersection in particular on my daily commute that is nearly impossible to avoid. It is a 4 way stop that is in a very high traffic area. 2 of the 4 ways almost never have cars since they go into two apartment complexes. All I can think about is how this problem could be remedied by my solution to switch all stop signs with yields. Another example, driving around my own apartment complex there are several stop signs. They appear every few hundred feet and I feel require an unnecessary amount of stops that give an unwanted wear and tear on my brakes. A yield sign operates as a stop sign when there is traffic against it. This allows for unneeded stops to occur and keep traffic moving at a better pace. I'm sure the biggest complaint against this would be it would make people more reckless on the road. I believe that it would force drivers to be more aware of their surroundings because the amount of cars on the road directly impacts whether or not they have to stop. Change my view!
