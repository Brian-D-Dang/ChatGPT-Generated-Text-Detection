During the last recession, there was a big trend towards part time employment that tons of people have been complaining about. I think this is a good thing in the long run, even though its causing a lot of hardship right now. The reason I think this is because as our productivity increases, which is has been doing at a skyrocketing rate, we can either increase our consumption, or decrease our amount of time spent working to match the new productivity. I would greatly prefer the second option as I believe it leads to a better life overall, and that is what seems to be happening: we are working less. I suspect that as productivity continues to improve, more and more people will become part time, and I think thats great! I would even support laws encouraging a company to hire 2 part-timers to do the work of 1 full-timer (these laws would have to be introduced gradually of course, to allow society to adjust) Can you CMV?
