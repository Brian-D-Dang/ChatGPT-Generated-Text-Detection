It's complicated. But basically, many of them believe that they are reincarnations of supernatural beings, like dragons or trolls or elves. Some people put religious emphasis on it, but most of them don't seem to. It's not a gender thing, it's a "I am not human like the rest of you. I am special and powerful and magical, even if in my current form you can't tell the difference." My cynical view is that it's a way for people who desperately want to feel special and superior to others because their personal lives suck to have a reason to look down at other people, or to excuse poor socialization because they're not human, so it's okay to ignore them.','They are people who believe they have the souls of something non-human...cats, angles, dragons, Klingons, you name it. The hangout on the internet, playing "I'll believe your story if you believe mine," and get super defensive when people "oppress" them by not believing them. They often try to latch on to the transgendered acceptance movement, or alternately, a lot of people bring them up to refute being transgendered.
