People dislike the federal reserve because they make money out of thin air every year which causes all of our money to decrease in value. This is much like a hidden tax on your currency on top of the taxes you already pay, and people hate taxes. At times they seemingly make money according to no set rules or plan, or for reasons that do not benefit us, and this often does very bad things to our economy. If we however had a set amount of money in circulation and that never changed all of it would increase in value every year until the point in some distant future where a penny could buy a car, so there is reason to create money, they just do it to a point where goods cost more every year (even as the technology for making them becomes less expensive) instead of keeping the value of currency about the same, which from my point of view is better. Who gets the money that is created? Banks, the money is created from out of nowhere anytime a bank wants to borrow money to in turn play the role of a middle man to a person who wants to take out a loan from the bank, this is regulated by interest rates the fed sets. They don't necessarily just create X dollars per year, they choose the interest they wish to charge banks to borrow from them, and the lower they set the interest rate increases the amount of money people want to borrow and thusly more money gets created.
