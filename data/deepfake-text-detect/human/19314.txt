Going to continuously edit this post, so it may become a wall of text. Sorry in advance. My view is that Windows OS and Xbox should be combined. Also that Microsoft should open up the new combined OS to manufactures and let Dell, Toshiba, Gateway, Samsung the ability to produce machines like the XBOX. I think Android does a great job of this. Google builds the base operating system, and Samsung reworks it with a suite of features. The partnership of companies makes for better products. Ultimately leaving consumers with better devices. Letting Samsung and HTC build phones using android doesn't stop Google from making the nexus. This partnership also helps Google get their products and services on more then just nexus devices. This is how I see it working. Microsoft builds Windows OS with XBOX live subscription service or app. The OS can be installed on any machine, but the XBOX live would have system requirements. WindowsLive updates would be downloadable and new systems would come out monthly, without rendering old systems obsolete.
