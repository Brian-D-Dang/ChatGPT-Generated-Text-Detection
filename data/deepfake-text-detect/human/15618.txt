I haven't been to a Red Robin since living in Anchorage. That was over twenty years ago; I was rather young. While I didn't remember the flavors, I did remember my experience fondly. This goes to show that memories as a child can be skewed somewhat. The interior decor is an over-the-top tchotchky reminiscent of a restaurant one might find at a theme park, i.e. Disney World. On the meal for this visit: Clam chowder Prime Rib Sandwich French Onion Soup Chicken Pesto Pasta I am a very big fan of foods that are layered, but in RR's case I must make an exception. When that layering includes being overseasoned and lacking flavor something is wrong. The people people cooking the meals must not like the flavor of the base ingredients with as much seasoning salt as they use. I was dehydrated for quite some time after having finished my meal. I really don't understand how I could have liked this restaurant as a child, especially considering I can get better tasting items out of a can or the freezer. Stouffers makes a better chicken pesto pasta at a much lower price. There are just too many other better restaurants in the area to consider returning.
