When someone is trying to solve a hard problem I feel telling said person that foo, that subject they are concerned with is "a numbers game" is a disingenuous thing to say. Every thing can be reduced to "a numbers game" if you took a couple minutes to think about it. Saying foo is a numbers game is a clever way to avoid thinking about the problem. If someone is having a hard social problem, you could just dismiss it as a numbers game, but I never heard of anyone following up with a reference to economists. Someone saying that foo is a numbers game is a shining example of the Dunning-Kruger effect. Try asking someone who say that to write the numbers down. Their respond would nearly always be do more bar to get foo. The reason they can't just say do more bar is if they are wrong and they get called out on it and get proven wrong they will feel bad for it. So they say "do more bar to get foo" as the euphemism "foo is a numbers game" so they have more room to away.
