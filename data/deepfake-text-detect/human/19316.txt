I see abortion no different than capital punishment or killing in combat. As a society, we have accepted the right to kill someone for acts of violence, while at war, and during pregnancy. We have also outlined rules for when it is socially acceptable to kill animals or people in pain. However, the argument I always see around abortion is "where does life begin." Who cares where life begins in regards to abortion? We only care about the quality of life of the mother and unborn child. Leave your opinion on where life begins out of the abortion debate. I believe if Pro Choice folks (including myself) addressed the actual issue (the society-accepted killing of a fetus) head on, we would have a much more valuable honest conversation about this topic. For example, "yes, abortion is killing, but like other forms of killing (capital punishment, war, euthanasia, the meat industry), it creates more productivity and higher quality life in our society." Change my view. Edit: to clarify, I am discussing the argument of where human life begins. I consider it killing a fetus because the fetus is alive (composed of cells, uses energy, grows, different levels of organization, adapt to environment). Edit 2: it may help to clarify that I believe the personhood argument is also non-valuable in the abortion discussion
