I was having a debate with a fairly hard-core social activist blogger the other day, and, in our discussion, we found that we had a fundamental disagreement that formed a roadblock to our debate. Her claim was that racism and sexism only apply when they are against an oppressed minority. I, in contrast, believe that racism, sexism, and other forms of oppression and discrimination apply no mater who they're applied to. For example: If a black person is discriminated against and denied a job solely on the basis that they're black, that is racism and it's wrong. My disputed corollary: If a white person is discriminated against and denied a job solely on the basis that he's white, due to affirmative action, that is racism and it is wrong. If society thinks less of a woman because she doesn't have blond hair, big boobs and a round butt and isn't pencil thin, that's sexism and that's wrong. If society thinks less of a man because he doesn't have Ryan Gosling abs and an uncompromised machismo, that is sexism too. Where is my reasoning wrong here? I'm a confused college student and it seems that all of my peers have a stance contrary to mine, but that seems wrong too. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
