For example the reason I am against Sonia Sotomayor is because she made poor decisions in many of her cases, for example: Ricci v Destefano: the case in my opinion was used more to highlight legal and racial issues rather than actually deal with them, instead of dealing with them it just pointed them out, and just handed money to the plaintiffs it really didn't provide precedent (in my opinion) for anything. Wendy E. Long, counsel for the Judicial Confirmation Network says "Judge Sotomayor is a liberal judicial activist of the first order who thinks her own personal political agenda is more important than the law as written. She thinks that judges should dictate policy, and that one's sex, race, and ethnicity ought to affect the decisions one renders from the bench I feel like she was appointed as a way to garner Latino interests and sort of just strengthen the Democrat's way of saying, "hey look we care about you guys one of you is now in the Supreme Court." She also seems to be the kind of person who uses her ethnic background to get attention especially with things like Affirmative Action and why we should not abolish or get rid of it. Basically I'm just using the Ricci V Destefano as an example, but as a justice she has done nothing really to make her really memorable other than be the first Hispanic Supreme Court Justice.
