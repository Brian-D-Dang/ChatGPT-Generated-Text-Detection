I am going on a Birthright trip soon, and I am feeling very conflicted about going. I am pretty liberal in most ways, but I don't understand a whole lot about international politics, although I try. Obviously, I've been hearing a lot about the conflict on the West Bank, because I don't completely live under a rock. While I think that Israel does what it has to do a lot of the time, and I do think that liberal media often misrepresents Israel, I do not approve of the settlements. Some of my more educated liberal acquaintances are advocating a boycott of Israeli products and companies. They do not know I am going to go on this trip, and I am embarrassed to tell them. Is it wrong for me to go on the trip? I don't want to cancel, because this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me to see Israel and meet some interesting new people. But oh, the guilt. Guide me? (I may be slow to respond to comments, but I will read everything)
