"To never have been born may be the greatest boon of all" - Sophocles. "I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it." - Mark Twain. I can completely relate to these sentiments and as a result, I don't think it's my place to bring another life into this planet and put it through the trials and tribulations of life. I'm not sure I want this CMV to be about whether to have children or not. I mainly want people to CMV that being alive is such a bane. I don't know why, even though I've had some really great moments in life, the idea that there was a time when I never knew about any of these brings me so much more joy than being here. And I do look forward to death. I believe, of course, that there's nothing after life. Not that I'm suicidal at the moment or anything either. I'm basically of the mindset that I'm already here, might as well make the most of it before I go.
