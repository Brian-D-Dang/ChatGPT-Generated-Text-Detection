I read someone describe love as handing over to someone else the power to destroy you emotionally, and trusting them not to. I don't think love is a smart investment of self. No one ever anticipates being burned in love, and yet the chances are that the vast majority, and even possibly all, the relationships in your romantic life will end that way, often through no fault of your own. You can pour all of your love into someone for years and they can walk away for no other reason beyond "not feeling it" anymore or having met someone else. You can't control other people, you can only control yourself and your own actions. Knowing the brutal truth of the fact that you can't make someone fall or stay in love with you, I believe the risk and pain of being burned in love after years of sacrifice and fidelity is a worse prospect than the pain of maintaining emotional self-sufficiency, finding happiness and fulfilment with life by yourself and never having been in love.
