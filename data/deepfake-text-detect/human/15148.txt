Like always I am glad to try out new hotels while taking my every 6 months trip to Vegas. And I was very impressed with this tourist trap hotel. The rooms were much bigger than ones I have stayed at in the same area. With a ton of gaming machines I don't find everywhere. I would definitely stay at this place again if were an option.
