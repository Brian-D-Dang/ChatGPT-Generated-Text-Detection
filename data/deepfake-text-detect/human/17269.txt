This is especially true around elections. They'll bring in the "expert" to report on the latest news surrounding the election, but heshe will report on every single thing one candidate will do wrong, while ignoring the mistakes the other has made. This will make the side the expert is going for seem like the obvious answer, which can skew the poll results. The solution is not to hire someone who claims to be a true independent, but to not have these experts at all, since almost anyone will root for one side or the other. Feel free to change my view.
