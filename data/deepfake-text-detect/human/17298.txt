I have forgotten the math, but essentially a friend and I calculated that the time it takes to physically recognize a penny, bend over, pick it up, and then resume your business is not worth your time if you aren't dedicating your time to solely and infinitely consecutively picking up pennies. What we deemed a proper valuation of worth via time is comparing the derivative (specific rate of pay at the instance of picking up a penny) to the derivative of pennies per same instance of time as a part of a minimum wage. We found is that since you make more pennies per the same instance of time sticking to a minimum wage job, and minimum wage is the price floor for airquotesminimal sustainable financial securityairquotes then it is not worth your time regardless of you working or not at the time of picking the penny. Additionally, pennies in general have very little buying power. You can't use them in most vending machines, toll booths, parking meters, or any non-cashier-related transactions. Through trying to pay with exact change, fiddling with pennies adds even more time to transactions, decreasing their worth on top of their comparably lower "worth-of-your-time" to pennies you accumulate through the pay of a minimum wage job.
