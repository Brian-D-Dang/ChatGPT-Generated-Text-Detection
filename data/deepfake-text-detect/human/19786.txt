When will America really face the hard truth? Turkey is overrated. I don't care how "moist" your gram-gram makes it. Bake it. Fry it. It's a dry ass bird. You work on it forever in your mouth till it forms that familiar turkey paste you have to choke down every year. If we really loved turkey, there would be a successful chain of Turkey based restaurants. We don't. We keep lying to ourselves, while we fill up on everything but turkey. Leftovers? Mostly turkey. A dozen people can't eat a whole bird? I've seen less eat a whole pig! Fuck turkey! Stop the madness!
