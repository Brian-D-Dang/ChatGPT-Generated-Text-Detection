Revan is, in my opinion, the greatest character in the Star Wars universe. At the very least, he is the greatest Jedi character. Revan was, at different points in his life, both the Dark Lord of the Sith and the leader of the Jedi Order. His fall from grace and return to the light side makes Darth Vader look like a child throwing a tantrum over a bad date. He led a successfully defection from the Jedi Order, went to search for the Sith's power, became a Sith himself and defeated the Jedi, was betrayed by his lieutenant, had his memory wiped, returned as a Jedi to defeat Malak, then went in search for the Emperor. There he was joined by the Jedi Exile (another great character), and even as she was killed and he was imprisoned, he was able to influence the Emperor to prevent him from conquering the galaxy for 300 years. There is no other person in the Star Wars universe who can come close to matching the experience or accomplishments of Revan's life. Revan is the only Dark Lord of the Sith to be fully redeemed to the light side and become a Jedi again.
