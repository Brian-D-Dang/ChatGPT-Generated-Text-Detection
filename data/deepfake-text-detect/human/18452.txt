The Double-Decker Couch, as popularized by [The Lego Movie] , is a bad idea. Intended to allow watching TV together and being buddies, the couch is shaped like a bunk bed, but with couches. [See here] for a visual approximation. As noted by Lord Business, a person sitting in the middle on the top couch would need to climb over someone to get off if they wanted something to eat or drink or needed to use the bathroom. Additionally, the people on the bottom row would have feet dangling in front of them, which is not conducive to watching TV or being buddies. The goals of the couch could be accomplished by a simple bunk bed with couch cushions placed along the wall. Because beds are wider than couches, people's legs would not dangle over the edge. There would also be room for people to get out of the top middle spot without needing to climb over someone else. There can also be headboards shaped to hold items like food or drinks. Plus, this has the added bonus of being a bed. Two beds actually. To quote master-builder Vitruvius regarding the Double-Decker Couch, That idea is just the worst. CMV! Hello, users of CMV!
