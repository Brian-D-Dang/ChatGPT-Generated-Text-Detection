Beautiful dining room hidden in Old Town Scottsdale. We made a reservation and scored an outdoor table on a lovely May evening. It was the perfect night to sit outside and enjoy an amazing meal. My husband and I shared the grilled octopus to start - fresh, flavorful and inventive. I tried the duck for my entree and it was perfectly prepared...a little sweet with the cherry demi and a little savory with the mushrooms and kale. This place is a must stop on your culinary tour of the Valley.
