I think a little motivation is great every once in a while. But you shouldn't have to subscribe to it. Getting your daily dose can be attained through yourself; you shouldn't have to find it on some pretty graphic or music video where snowboarders are doing crazy stunts and mountain bikers are taking on downhills. To me, that's just being weak. I think you should find your own motivation.
