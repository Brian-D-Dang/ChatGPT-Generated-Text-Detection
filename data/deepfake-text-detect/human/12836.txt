The Apple What is a God? I've always wondered, Is there one or many more? Is God just something we made up, To make up for our flaws? Does God follow me around, Everywhere I go? Can God provide the answers, To all I need to know? How is God supposed to sound? Does he even have a voice? When I have a hard decision, Can he help me make a choice? Is he always watching me? Does he know now where I am? Can God give me guidance, When I find myself in a jam? I searched for him, high and low, But he was nowhere to be found. And still it tugged away at my soul, There must be a God around! Then the answer dawned upon me, As I started to text a friend. And I slowly stared in horror..... At the iPhone in my hand.
