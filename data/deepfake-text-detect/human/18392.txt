I think it's immoral for a person who is unavailable for whatever reasons to flirt with people and getting their hopes up. By flirting I mean more than just being respectful, mannered and a kind person. I mean suggestive smirks, cute comments, playful touching, prolonged eye contact, lip biting and so on. Signs that will always be interpreted as sexualromantical-flirting by a hopeful person. The reason I think it's immoral is that it makes people who find you attractive inlove with you without having any chance of you reciprocating Think about it. All day everyday you meet people you find attractive, but you rarely ever fall in love with any of these. That usually only occurs after they give you the illusion of having a shot at your fantasy. I used to think that being desired and flirting with people was innocent until I had to tell 2 of my closest friends (opposite sex) that I had no interest in them that way. One of them admitted to having been in love with me for 2 years and was secretly hoping for me to do something about it since I was always flirting. Sure the person could've told me right away that she was having feelings for me and cleared up the mess earlier, but usually by that point the damage has already been done. So in conclusion: by flirting you risk making people fall in love with you which can cause them years of agony which could've been avoided if you had only been clear about your LACK of romanticsexual interest in them.
