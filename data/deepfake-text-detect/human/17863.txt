When I say over, I mean the new roll comes out in front like [this] as opposed to the [under] orientation. It is so much easier to pull down more squares with the roll coming over. Every time I come across an under roll, I usually end up have to do a complete 360 until I can find the start. Not only does this waste time, it just seems unhygienic to have to touch the whole roll, or have to reach around just to grab hold of it. I used to think people were just lazy when loading a new roll and didn't look at the orientation, but the other day I heard someone say they always place the roll the other way. Can someone who prefers their toilet roll in the "under" orientation please explain the appeal and convince me that the "over" way is wrong?
