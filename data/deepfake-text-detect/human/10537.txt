As though speaking to an actual five year old: Imagine that the water hose is a flashlight, or a headlight, or anything that makes light. when I point the water hose right next to you and turn it on, a few drops of water will hit you. Those drops of water are like the little particles of light that you would see if a car was pointing it's headlights near you. If I pointed the hose directly at you and turned it on, the water that hit you would be like the light that you saw looking into a cars headlights. Now imagine that I sprayed a tree that was right next to you. The water that hit you when I sprayed the tree is like the light you would see on a foggysmokey day when a car near you turns on it's headlights. The little particles of light hit the fog and bounce in all directions instead of just going in a straight line. That's why more particles hit you (and so you see them and the lights look brighter) and also why your headlights don't shine as far in the fogsmoke.," "It's not stronger, it's just light reflecting off the smoke particles and into your eyes. The same thing happens to lights and snow or rain.
