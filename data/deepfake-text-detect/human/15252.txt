Odd. I thought this place was pretty well respected for its BBQ fare. Ribs were overcooked. Fall off the bone is nice, but not fall to pieces and get delivered in a pile of mixed bone and meat. Sauce was old. No smoke flavor. At all. Brisket was the same. Moosh. Nasty coagulated fat. No smoke ring, no smoke. Dry. Food service grade meat per the coarse grain with the marble cooked out of it. Fried okra; moosh. Tasteless. Mac and cheese was tasty, but swimming bechamel. Best thing I had was.......the Texas toast. Visited at 7:15 pm on a Thursday. Pretty empty. Maybe the other location (s) are up to speed but this visit reeked of par cooked nasty.
