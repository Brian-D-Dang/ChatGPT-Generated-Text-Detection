I took our VW Passat here on Wednesday to get the oil changed. They squeezed me in, and rotated the tires too. Cool. As I was driving to Minneapolis on Friday, however, the plastic bottom covering the engineoil area (or whatever is down there, I don't really know) began to fall off. Eventually, I had to stop at a random dealership right outside of Eau Claire so that they could remove the rest of the plastic, which had been dragging on the highway. I called Goodyear, and Polly basically said oh yeah, we noticed that the bolts were stripped that hold it on, we shouldn't have put it back on. This is a common problem with VWs, and it's really not a big deal - the plastic isn't necessary for the car, it's just a pain when it actually falls off and drags. What I don't understand is why they put it back on when it was obvious to them that it wasn't going to stay on. So now it's back at Goodyear for the day. They are putting a new cover on, for free of course.
