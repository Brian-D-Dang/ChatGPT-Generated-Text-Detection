Apple announced new developer tools at WWDC this week, including Object Capture, Xcode Cloud, in-app events and custom pages, and updates to Swift. Object Capture allows developers to create 3D objects within minutes from 2D photos. Xcode Cloud is a cloud workflow tool that enables developers to scale across the Apple product line to find and fix issues and for easier testing. In-app events and custom pages let developers better target and connect with users. Swift will get concurrency so that apps can take advantage of multi-core processes. It will also receive low-code tools.
