There seems to be no profession which better exemplifies bravery and heroism than that of the firefighter. I believe this because: - They willingly take great personal risks like entering burning and collapsing buildings - They are highly physically fit and very skilled - They don't have the negative violent connotations of the police or military - Their primary purpose is to save lives and help people in dangerous situations Thus, I believe they deserve more respect for their work than almost anyone else. CMV, try and convince me of why another profession is better or why firefighters aren't all they're cracked up to be.
