They purposly make you wait in long line to make more purchases. I was picking up one chocolate and had to wait 15 minutes in line. They only have one line behine bakery line which each customer will order bakery goods takes several minutes each. They use long line trick to think they are very busy and also you will pick up more stuff while waiting. It is a dirty trick and unethical business behavior. They are also way overpriced for something that is not very special or tasty. Chocolate was not even that good for such a high price.
