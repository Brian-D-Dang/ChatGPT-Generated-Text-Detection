Clause 5 of Section 1 of Article 2 of the US Constitution states that "No Person except a natural born Citizen... ...shall be eligible to the Office of President I believe that this aspect of the clause is unnecessary, a hold-over from an 18th century fear of a foreign, royalist Manchurian candidate winning the presidency. It was nonsense then and it's nonsense now. The citizen and residency requirements, combined with the proliferation of knowledge through various media today and American culture make such a plot so exceedingly unlikely that the possibility of it occurring is practically nil. Furthermore, I believe that this clause perpetuates Nativist, anti-immigrant sentiment in the U.S. that the Chinese, Irish, Italians, Japanese and others have all faced, so that even when a person spends two decades going through the hoops of becoming a U.S. citizen in order to participate in American democracy they are not seen as trustworthy enough to be allowed to run for President. however, someone who was handed that right at birth is somehow seen as more trustworthy. Being a naturalised citizen should be enough to be eligible to run for president. CMV.
