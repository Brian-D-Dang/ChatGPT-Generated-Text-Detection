Because oversight is weak, there is a distinct possibility that the NSA's machinery could be used for anti-democratic purposes, including spying upon protesters, blackmailing politicians, prosecuting whistleblowers and creating a general fear of the authorities. Even if the programs and their uses are legal, a world in which the USA is able to examine all private communications for its own self-benefit seems obviously problematic. It does not matter if this is occurring or not: the possibility that this is occurring is a sufficient threat against democracy, both today and tomorrow, that such powers should be reined in.
