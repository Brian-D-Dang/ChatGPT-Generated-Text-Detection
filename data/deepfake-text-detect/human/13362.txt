It was once a man, no longer. A faceless being stalking our dimension as it goes; It would appear in small towns, hamlets might you call them, and in the next few days multiple disappearances would follow. It may sound like the thing out of a horror movie, but in truth, it was real; The brain of an animal; the body of a man; everybody assumed it had to feed. But the question was, what did it feed on? It had to be humans. It would explain the disappearances. Our governments made a monster. The people knew it. They all did, but there was no way to stop it.
