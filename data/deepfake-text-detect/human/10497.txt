One of the biggest business banks are in is loans. Some business requires loans and banks use their customer's money to fund the business. Okay if you want to know where a bank produce goods, see this scenario: Sally is earning 100 a week from her job. She wants to build a bakery which will earn her 500 a week. But a bakery cost 10,000 to build. sally will have to save up to 100 weeks before she can start her bakery. Unless.... There's banks! The bank evaluate Sally' business as a good business and loan her 10,000 straight up. Sally will have to repay back with interest, say 12,000 in 100 weeks. Sally will earn 50,000 and then repay back the bank, making profit of 38,000. So in scenario A: Sally starts a business with no profit being made in 100 week. In B, Sally is already 38,000 ahead. This is essentially the "economic stimulation" from loaning people are talking about. PS: I'm typing this on my iPad so excuse me.', "Banks give out and produce money. They take a customer's money, loan it to other people with interest, and get the bankeconomy more money.,the government does not keep my liquid currency for me. Nor does the government pool deposits, invest them on my behalf, then give me interest.
