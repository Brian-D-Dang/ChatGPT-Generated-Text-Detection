I am in no way arguing the fact that NASCAR takes skill, and in no way can anyone just pick up NASCAR and win. It takes decision making and racing strategies, the driving ability to take a turn going 170 MPH, and the ability not to throw up when that many G's are exerted on someone. But I can't consider NASCAR to be a sport because it doesn't take an athlete or any type of athletic prowess, besides, perhaps, above average calves to press down on a gas pedal. The competitveness of car racing is there, but not the athletic ability. Defensive linemen in football, no matter how much of an athlete they may not look like, can lift 450 pounds and restrain, at times, two other 250 pound men trying to get by them. But in general, there is nothing that has to be athletic about a NASCAR driver, no matter how skilled they are. Please, CMV. sport - "An athletic activity involving skill and physical prowess, often of a competitive nature." athletic - "physically active and strong; of or pertaining to athletes; involving the use of physical skills or capabilities, as strength, agility, or stamina"
