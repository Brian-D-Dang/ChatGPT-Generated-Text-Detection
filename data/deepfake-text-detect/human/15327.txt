Okay, the Hot and Ready deal is a joke. They never have the 5 pizzas ready, and there is always a wait. To top it off, the last three times I have been there, the clueless counter person has given away our pizza and bread to someone else, making our supposed 10 minute wait closer to 20-25 minutes. While you can't beat the cheap price, the service is seriously lacking.
