I have an extreme distaste for the instrument's timbre. I think this has a lot to do with growing up in the 80's and early 90's, right? Saxophones voice the soundtrack to urban despondency, grainy educational filmstrips, soft focus foreplay on polyester sheets, and Sunday afternoon buffets with grandma at the rotary club. Disparate evocations - all off-putting. And I feel like I have deep personality issues with them too. I get that they're expressive, but whether it's articulate little honks and beeps or dynamic brassy legato or brain-vibrating squawks - the sax is going to cut through other instrumentation with all that arrogant opinion. Kind of an improvisational tool for egomaniacal contrarians. Is a sax really capable of playing a support role in a passage of a composed song? It's always so ... there. I honestly want my view changed here; I feel like my imprinted sax hatred essentially shuts me out of jazz, and that seems like a shame. Is there a path I can take to saxophone tolerance? Here are a couple examples to show you what you're working with: [This] is as close as my ears have gotten to liking saxophone. I completely dig the song and even the way the saxophones are played; I just want to lose the unease that timbre gives me. On the other hand, I came upon [this] a couple years ago. I really really love the clarinet in this song. It just sounds great. Makes all the difference in the world. Edit: Thanks to all for the thoughtful responses and your dedication to fighting saxophobia and ignorance.
