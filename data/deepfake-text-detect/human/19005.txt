Trading card games are completely unfair and shouldn't be considered "competitive" in the slightest. For starters, they heavily rely on luck, and while there is an element of strategy, I would argue that it takes backseat to chance. You have to hope that you draw the card that your strategy pivots around, or you can't use it. Secondly, the richest kid wins. The best cards are more expensive, and you can't possibly expect to win against someone with more of the best cards (unless of course, you get lucky, which goes back to my other point.) Cheap cards can't out-strategy expensive ones. It's impossible. Note that this argument applies to trading card games, but not deck building games, which also rely on luck but not money, because when you buy the set you have the same cards as everyone else. EDIT: I'm also going to add this argument proposed by uNaturalSelectorX I think you could have a stronger case if you said they were unfair because of the constant introduction of new cards that drastically change value or strategic use of other cards. Introducing new cards is a clear money-grab, and I can't think of another game which constantly trashes your investment. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
