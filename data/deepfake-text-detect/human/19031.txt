I have just come off two years of using an iPhone, and just find the touch tracking on my new galaxy just seems sloppy all around. That is the obvious competitor for android phones, this isnt just a phone debate as you'll see. Just overall the android system doesnt seem nearly as user friendly and tidy as the iphone's. There are a lot of really loose ends i feel are such quick fixes. One specifically is the position marker blocking access to words when correcting text. another is the fact that if you type ANYTHING outside of the english language it will save it as a NEW word in the user dictionary. Then when typing (using swipe) those small words, for some reason, get priority over the more logical words. This leads users to having to constantly delete nonsense from the user dictionary just to type real english. Iphone had custom words but i never had those problems with the auto correct, I mean there were obviously issues, but not nearly as annoying as on this galaxy. My thinking is that there is some obvious advantages to super tech savvy people that fly right under my radar, because if that doesn't exist then i think the whole trend towards androidsamsung is a feat of marketing.
