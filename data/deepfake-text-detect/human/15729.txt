This was the first Toys'R' Us ever in Scotland and if that's not something to brag about, I don't know what is. Who doesn't love this place? It's awesome! A huge store filled to the brim with toys of all kinds. My mum and dad used to take me here when I was younger when were through in Edinburgh and I'd more often than not leave with a new toy in toe. Result! My favourite toy I ever got from here was a Cabbage Patch doll called Rosalee Molly, I took that doll everywhere with me even though she was probably the ugliest doll ever made. Nowadays whenever I think of Toys'R' Us I think of the scene in Toy Story 2 where the gang are running around a toy store crusing around with the Barbies, hilarious!
