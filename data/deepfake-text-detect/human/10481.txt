Basically they're dried nasal mucus. You nose produces mucus to catch dirt and pathogens in the air so they don't end up in your lungs. This mucus gets moved by little hairs, called cilia, in your nose to your throat where you swallow it. But by being exposed to the air it can dry out and become harder. The closer to the nostrils the mucus is, the more likely it is to dry out. This harder material can't be moved by the cilia and thus stays in your nose.," "Boogers are the accumulation of the gunk in the air as it builds up on the mucus in your nose. The booger itself doesn't serve a purpose. It's like the lint caught in the lint trap of a dryer.
