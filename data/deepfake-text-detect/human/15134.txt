I will always remember this place as the sight of the worst meal I ever had. I tipped 25 just so I wouldn't feel bad as I'm writing this. Service was unsatisfactory. We were not offered a hello, a place to sit or even acknowledged for that matter. When we finished our meal I was craving mochi but was instead brought the check by the other waitress. The meal was a shitty bowl of seafood udon with overlooked, sparse muscles and inedible mixes of shrimp and octopus (both were overcooked and rubbery as well). I also had the worst spider roll to date. Do not eat here if you are seeking good, fresh and clean eating environment. Eat here if you want to punish yourself.
