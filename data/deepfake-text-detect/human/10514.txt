Newton's law of "universal gravitation" only applies to point masses - ie, theoretical objects whose entire mass is concentrated in a single point. If planets were perfect spheres, this would be a good enough approximation. However, most planets and moons have significant enough mass concentrations (sometimes called "masscons under their surface that make gravity vary with location over the body. Our Moon, for example, has even more variance than the Earth - even though it has a far lower mass and gravity, it is less equally distributed.
