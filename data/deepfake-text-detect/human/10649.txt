There is no definite answer, but it's been suggested that the extra fat women store is priming their bodies for childbearing. Also explains why the extra fat is often stored around women's midsections, breasts, glutes and thighs. Women at some point in their lives may nourish a fetus and then a baby from their own reserves, so women have to stock energy in the form of fat in anticipation of future pregnancies (and must stock even more energy during the last two trimesters of pregnancy).
