Adults should be able to make their own decisions on health and the use of medicine. However, children are at the mercy of their guardians for medical care. I am not judging the merits of prayerpositive thinking as a secondary way of coping with illness, but to do this as your only solution in the face of severe illness is not acceptable. This should be child abuse, and in some cases possibly more. I use the term "pray away" in the title, but this can be extrapolated to any faith based or other new age "cure" for disease. Children under 18 should be made to get proper medical treatment for severe diseases. I understand the term "severe" is vague, but I would consider it any disease that if left untreated could cause permanent damage or death. Hello, users of CMV!
