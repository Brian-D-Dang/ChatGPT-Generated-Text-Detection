Came here to get new tires, because my tread was getting pretty low on the front two. Ended up selling me all four, and I can't honestly tell you if it was absolutely necessary or not... But its ok, because now they are all new. About a week later I left town and parked my car at the airport to come back to my rear tire completely flat. Upset because I had just gotten new ones, but they said it was under warranty so I took it back in. First staff member wasn't the friendliest, and I waited an hour and a half for them to patch a hole or find what was wrong. They came out to say they couldn't find anything wrong with it (after putting it in water to see bubbles and everything. etc..) I was pretty upset, but figured, well If it gets flat again I will just bring it back. Literally, 4 days later the exact same tire... flat. Thankfully I have an air pressure pump at my condo because there is no way I could of even drove to a gas station. I filled it, and as I was putting the cap on the gauge, I see a very thick, and metal something sticking out in the tread. Exactly what had caused the initial flat. VERY upset, that they' couldn't find it' I took it back, circled it in the brightest red lipstick I own and barged in. Store manager was there that day and was very nice and apologetic, and they patched the tire successfully. However, I don't think I will go back next time as it makes me a bit weary to know that tire tecs can't find a piece of metal sticking out of the tire. Also felt a bit like they tried to take me the first round since I was a female and was upfront about knowing nothing about car specs.
