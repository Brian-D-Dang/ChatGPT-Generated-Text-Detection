I recently watched the documentary "The Crisis of Civilization," which stipulates that climate change, global terrorism, food shortages, peak oil, etc. will result in the complete collapse of our modern civilization. The documentary is narrated by international security analyst Dr. Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed of the British Institute for Policy Research and Development . If this were a conspiracy nut-job, it would be a trivial matter to dismiss the claims of this documentary; but it's done by a renowned security analyst. Upon watching it, I came upon the realization that we as a civilization may have only a short time before the crap hits the fan. I have therefore come to see entertainment and recreation as useless pursuits; wanting instead to focus on ways to change the world and direct it from this course of self-destruction. Please, change my view and let me enjoy my life and hope for the future once more.
