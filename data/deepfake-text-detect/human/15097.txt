Just had a very memorable experience her this past weekend. We made a reservation and my boyfriend asked that since it was a date to make is special. When we arrived, they sat us right away at a round banquette that overlooked the entire restaurant from the back of the room. Perfect location. The interior was festive but collected and calm at the same time. Very tastefully done. We went there specifically for the tasting menu, which my boyfriend had had before and loved. It was the most impressive meal I've had, not just because of the food but because we were served by a TEAM. There was the bread guy, the busser guy, the wine guy, and the main server. They could not have been more polite, attentive, or friendly. thinking we were jsut getting tastes of wine parings for each dish, we started out with a bottle of white but we sure didn't need it - each pairing was a full glass of the most perfect wine. The wine guy (our own personal sommolier) gave a description of each after pouring, and the only complaint was that he was soft spoken so we had a hard time hearing him. They were all probably a bunch of adjectives anyway, we're not wine snobs so we didn't care too much. I had to try real hard not to till up with each dish, knowing there was more to come - 8 dishes in all. God, it was SOOOOO good. After that I was so full of wine and stuffed with incredible food I just went back to our hotel and zonked out!;-P For anyone looking for a memorable dining experience, there's lots of celebrity chef restaurants out there but this one was really worth it. The bill came out to about 300 for two with tip, I believe (i just glanced at it as he opened it) Not bad at all.
