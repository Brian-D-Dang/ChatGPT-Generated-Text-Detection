Cis in Latin means "on this side" while trans means "on the other side." The terms are commonly used in describing isomers in organic chemistry to describe the ways two molecules can have the same formula but have different shapes based on the rotation of a bond. When the term transgender came into popular use, it followed that the appropriate term for someone not transgender would be cisgender using the same convention.', "It is the opposite of transgendered. So, if transgendered means someone who feels they are born in the wrong body (so their brains says man, but their body is female), then cisgendered means someone who is born in the right body, so to speak (so the brain says man, and their body is male.) edit: as for where it comes from. Trans is a latin prefix. Cis is the antonym of that in latin. The term was coined in papers to be able to talk about transpeople and their place in society the differences they face compared to people who are not trans without needing to use a long, convoluted way (for example, needing to say'people who identify with their birth sex or using words that can be potentially loaded vague.," "that you're a man born in a mans body or a female born in a females body. so pretty much utter useless since its basically descirbing like what? 99.8 or whatever percent of all human beings... just another definition that no one needed. its basically like redifining the word human.," "If your own idea of what gender you are matches up to what society sees you as, you're cisgendered.,Cis-Gendered "Normal" to the man in the street but that would be a very insulting way to explain it in the presence of the kind of person who might feel the need to use the word since it suggests everyone else is abnormal. I harbour no ill will to those who do not identify as Cis-Gendered but I am very careful about the words I use around them. In the company of exclusively cis people i'd use "normal" or "regular." Around non cis people I use the word cis.
