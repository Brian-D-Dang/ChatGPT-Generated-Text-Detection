I'm a big scotch fan, and if you are too, then this is the place for you. Great selection of single malts as well as blends if that's your taste preference (mine). Had appetizers and Scottish ale beer on my recent visit, and sat at the bar. The menu looked interesting and I'll be back to try more of it.
