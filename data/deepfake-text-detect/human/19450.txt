In my province schools distribute lists of specific items that the children must buy and bring to school in order to fulfill the requirements for the year. This is a list of perfectly reasonable items like pens, paper, glue sticks, etc. So parents all go out and purchase these items from retail stores at very high markups, spending an hour or two of time, and in many cases they overspend on unnecessary items. I believe that school boardsgovernment should purchase and have available these items for the following reasons: governments pay well under 30 of retail for these items, probably even less, so the total cost would be much lower and leave more money in the pockets of families governments already accept it is there responsibility to school our youth, it seems perfectly logical that supplies that are REQUIRED for this should be supplied Hello, users of CMV!
