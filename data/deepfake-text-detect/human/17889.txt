For as long as I can remember I have been completely desensitised to death. I don't cry at funerals and I don't really mourn, not because I didn't love the person but because I think that all human beings are unimportant. I think the reasoning behind this is basically that over 180 billion people have died over time and only a tiny portion of those are remembered and even fewer are cared about. Ultimately we are all going to die and yeah people will mourn but when they also die, no one will care about us anymore. Me feeling like this is why I am for capital punishment and don't get shocked by murders or war. A lot of people think it makes me coldhearted or just a bastard. So CMV
