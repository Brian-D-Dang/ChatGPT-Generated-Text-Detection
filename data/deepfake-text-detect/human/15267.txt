I really like the food at Grimaldi's and the service in the dining area has always been excellent. However, service in the bar area is disappointing at best. It's a regular spot for me and my clients simply due to location. But I'm not sure I will frequent it again. After repeatedly receiving horrible service, I think I will find another spot where my business is appreciated. The past 3 times I was there, the bartender girls ignored me. I was seated at the bar with clients. I had to yell across the bar to order a glass of wine. we had 3 drinks each and each time I had to get her attention this way to get a drink. Not once did she ask- Would you like another drink? Also, I had to fight to get her attention just to get refills on water too. What really bothers me is that this is a service oriented business. We are great tippers. I'm in a business where good service is handsomely rewarded. Do the bartenders there not realize this? I'll never go there again. Either management needs to step up their game and train these girls properly or risk losing regular customers.
