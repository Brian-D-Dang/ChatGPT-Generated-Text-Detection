I was recently in a debate with one of my friends (who frequently pirated games) about how piracy is a serious crime. He said that he could name several crimes that were worse, including public nudity. I then began to argue with him about how piracy is a much worse crime. These were my reasons. My first main reason was that even in the law, piracy (over 500) is considered a felony, while public nudity is considered a misdemeanor. He the said that the law can be wrong. I then said that taking something that someone worked really hard on, without their permission, is far worse than showing another person a part of your body that everyone has already seen. He then brought up the case of young children. I then said that there is nothing inherently wrong with nudity and that nudity is more natural than wearing clothes. He then said that nudity can be traumatizing and can lead to serious issues later in life. I told him to show me a source, but he had none. So, reddit, I'm turning to you. CMV. Hello, users of CMV!
