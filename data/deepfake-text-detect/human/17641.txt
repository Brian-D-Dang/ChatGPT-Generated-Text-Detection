So my point is that Yanukovich was Putin's puppet and he fled country without a fight. Was he really so scared? I doubt it, he could just declare Kharkiv as new capital and split Ukraine on 22.02.14 "separatist conference." Or he could even start a real "civil" war like in Syria, with all his loyal military and police, obviously with strong Putin's support. But (I believe by order of Putin) Yanukovich choose not to fight, give the country on hands of opposition and now Putin can intimidate new gov with war. tl;dr Putin's best time for war was until Yanukovich was president, he could invade all country without organazied resistance. But he didnt and instead gave (almost) all country to his enemies, so they can prepare for war. Also I saw analytics that concludes Russia dont have power to invade Ukraine.
