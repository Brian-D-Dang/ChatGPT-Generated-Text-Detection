I've been emotionally constipated for like a decade now. I've got depression and I'm working with a therapist to face feelings and thoughts, (I want to get my shit straight). Lately I'm digging bad memories out of the mental box I had to put them in so I can take them one at a time. When processing one and facing those emotions head on, I got tears in my eyes, but they won't leave. This habit of not allowing myself to cry developed around the time when my parents divorced. I realized I couldn't be crying every single time I missed one of them, so I got good at choking back the lump in my throat. Once in a great while in the privacy of my home,in my room I could cry (when I knew no one would see or hear me). By the time I was a teen though, I only cried maybe once a year, no matter how depressed I got. I drank and smoked dope through high school to keep my emotions out, but a lot of things (mostly girls I liked and the dudes they got with) pissed me off and I wasn't afraid to show it. I whupped the shit out of at least two guys who got with this girl I liked and was going to do the same to another who my girlfriend (of one week) cheated on me with. I feel like girls can get sad, but guys need to get mad. I'm sober now and realized my emotional constipation is causing most of my problems, and I need to be able to face feelings instead of living in fear of them. So change my view that guys can't cry. EDIT: Thanks for the help everyone!! I haven't cried today, (mainly because I had stuff to do) but I think I'll be less hesitant to face all the feelings I'm supposed to when the time comes. UPDATE: I was able to go back and cry in my therapy session today, when I considered all of the input I received, it really helped. It felt kind of like when you hold in your poop for half a day while you're in school or whatever and then get home and unload. Huge weight lifted and I feel more alive somehow. Thanks again for all the help.
