I believe that if consoles seized to exist, PC gaming as we know it would fail. As we know, performance and graphical visuals are for more superior on PC than current-gen consoles but we never see an all round improvement on either consoles or PC until the next generation of consoles comes along. For example - PS2Xbox era, PC games did look far better than their console counterpart, but the overall mass production of games during that generation didn't "change" until the next generation, and the same goes for PS3360 vs Xbox OnePS4 generation.
