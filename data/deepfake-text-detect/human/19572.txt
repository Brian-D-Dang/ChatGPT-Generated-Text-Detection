I was raised very liberal in New England, and still believe that environment is a stronger influence on a person than race. However, over the past 4 months I've grown in favor of white separatism. Whites are global minority, and it is necessary for them to establish a country where their culture can thrive (this is the model adopted by Israel, Japan and arguably any other cultural homogenous country that exhibits xenophobic immigration policies). The current climate of anti-white views disguised as: affirmative action, open borders (for western democracies only), minority favored government aid (small business loans, etc.), political correctness, and "white privilege" are guilt-driven attacks on white people, creating a prevailing esteem amongst whites that they are guilty for the wrongdoing in the world. Even if white culture has flaws, so does every culture. Many native cultures exhibit patriarchies or other class systems that aren't aligned with neoliberalism. I know many good people that are black, Indian (Asian), or Hispanic - but you must realize all these groups have home countries - where their culture can exist. Whites do not have that - most white dominated countries are bound by the rules of political correctness where they cannot practice their culture at the exclusion of other cultures - where all these other groups can.
