I want to like this place. I have tried extremely hard to like this place. I have gone three times doing lunch, twice with a co-worker and once with my girlfriend. First of all, we all loved the atmosphere. The anime girls serving the food, the little cards, the pictures and anime on the TV are all exceptional. It has all the makings of a very successful ramen house. The problem is the food is simply horrible! I am writing this short review with my stomach in cramps. We have tried between us approximately half a dozen dishes. None of us are really picky eaters either. I had to listen to my girlfriend complain for over a day about how bad the food was and how it upset her stomach. My co-worker swears that he will never go back due either. Some of the seafood in his ramen bad gone bad. I think the place really goes for atmosphere with low quality food to cut costs.
