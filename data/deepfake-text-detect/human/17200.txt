Let me preface this post by stating my hypothetical was inspired by something I read on The Volokh Conspiracy. Operatively, a ban on same-sex marriage does not ban two gay people from marrying, only two people of the same sex. To illustrate, let's take Amber, Bryan, and Cole. If same-sex marriage is not legal, Amber is allowed to marry Cole, but Bryan cannot marry Cole. This is true even if Amber and Bryan are identical in every respect, except their sex. Bryan is not able to marry Cole only because Bryan is a man. It seems sexual orientation has no effect on whether Amber, Bryan, or Cole can marry each other. Amber is still allowed to marry Cole, even if one is gay or lesbian. However, Bryan cannot marry Cole despite his sexual orientation. Thus, a same-sex marriage ban should be treated as sex discrimination, not as discrimination based upon sexual orientation. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
