A tank destroyer is usually a vehicle made with a low profile, and no rotating turret to better serve a stronger, or superior main weapon. It's chassis is usually taken from an already existing vehicle. The T34 is a tank with a 76mm general purpose main weapon. The SU-85 is a tank destroyer, made on the chassis of the T34, with a low profile, and an 85mm armour piercing gun. Many tank destroyers also have poor armour, such as the German Marder series.
