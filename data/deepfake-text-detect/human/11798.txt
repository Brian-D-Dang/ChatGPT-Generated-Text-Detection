Amazon has introduced a new initiative called'less packaging, more smiles' that will see the company reduce the materials used for sending out items as well as provide instructions for reusing boxes in fun ways. The new boxes will feature directions on how to use them to build a cat condo, a rocket ship, a robot costume, and more. Amazon plans to start using the packaging this week. The company aims to be net-zero carbon by 2040.
