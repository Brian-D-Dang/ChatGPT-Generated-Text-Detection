I have 2 cats, and I love this place. I buy them things like Innova Evo (dry and canned) and Nature's Variety frozen raw meat medallions, which are difficult to find. I can get the Evo at the Tempe Feed Tack, but they don't have a freezer for the other food. Sunflower even has the canned duck, which one of my cats inhales. Previously, I was going all the way out to In the Raw in Gilbert for the frozen stuff, ugh! I'm so thrilled this little place opened! It's not too far from my house, and the owner is awesome. Great product selection. Closed on Sunday.
