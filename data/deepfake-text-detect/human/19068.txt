My friends and I occasionally debate politics when we hang out and as much as I enjoy it, I don't believe there is always so much information out there that none of us can know enough to be able to be confident in what we're saying. For the record, I do have a basic idea of what I'm saying. I realize the Daily Show and Colbert Report aren't exactly hard news shows but I do watch both of those consistently, I listen to npr and economics podcasts, I read articles online that I can find to educate myself but I still feel like unless I'm spending hours a day researching, I have no idea what I'm talking about and shouldn't have arguing in favor of anything more complex than gay marriage (which doesn't even get debated). TL;DR - I feel like unless I spend hours a day researching politics and economics, I'm not qualified enough to have a strong political opinion and I have no right to argue for a position. Please CMV so I don't feel like an idiot. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
