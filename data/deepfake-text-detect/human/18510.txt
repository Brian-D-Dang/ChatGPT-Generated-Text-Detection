I was recently looking around online for a job, as my current contract is coming to an end. Many of the jobs I was looking at required a universitycollege degree. The employer didn't care what the degree was in, just the fact the candidate had a post secondary education in whatever field, related to the job or not. No one I know has been able to explain why they want a candidate to have this, so I'm hoping i could get a bit of an explanation on that as well. Now I understand this is all depending on the type of job, and that some in some instances it makes sense that you have a specific degree, but for jobs like doing Administration, or Human Resources, a job that could be taught with simple On Job Training, requiring a person to sit in class for 4 years seems like a waste of time. I think to request a degree instead of looking at real world experience for a job is completely pointless. CMV. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
