I'm continually unimpressed by the Amber Rose. I've not eaten there, and if I do I'll gladly update my review if it proves me wrong. But on the visits I've had, thoroughly unimpressed. Perhaps it's the expensive drinks, the obnoxiously loud music, or the unfortunate fact that I don't have breasts and therefore won't be served at the bar in under 15 minutes. Maybe it's the combination of the above. As I said, perhaps the charm of this place is in the food and if I ever eat there, I'll certainly revisit my review if I'm proved wrong. But as it stands, there's nothing making me want to go back to try.
