I've always joked about the notion that parents should pass a "course" or attend a "parenting 101" seminar before getting their first child because I can't help but to think that so many children are born into this world under horrible circumstances. I'm not really talking about the third world countries (although I'm not excluding them either), but I'm mostly talking about the developed countries. Too often I see parents not disciplining their children because they're afraid society will think it's "abuse" or because they don't want to be "mean" to them not realizing the ramification of their actions (or lack of them). Too often I see parents trying to be their childs "best friend" instead of teaching them how the world works and how to survive in it. Too often I see parents with atrocious personal finances, living paycheck to paycheck and heavily relying on welfare. I can't help but to wonder if they really thought things through... My arguments might not be the strongest but I hope for the sake of argument you can see my pointthought (even though it's quite depressing). I just can't help but to think that a lot of the problems we have as humans can be avoided or at least decreased if just parents world wide just had a little better knowledge of what they're getting into when they decide to bring a young one into the world. I am all for pro-choice (if you want a child then go have one but since it's arguably the biggest decision of your life, at least think it through. I'm not saying there should be a "reinforced ruleset," but just you know some common knowledge available like costs, time, effort etc. TL;DR - I'm very judging of other parents but who am I to judge really... I just feel sorry for some of the kids.
