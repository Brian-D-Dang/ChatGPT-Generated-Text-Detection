I don't think that having lots of sex negatively affects people. If you are safe and smart, there aren't many, maybe not any, negative consequences. I like my body, I like the things my body can do, and I like the way it feels when I have sex. So I have a lot of sex. If a slut is a girl who has a lot of sex, I'm a slut. I don't see why being a slut is something I should avoid. I don't see why people act like having sex causes some deep psychological scars. Sex crimes, like the one I was a victim of, are bad and hurtful and cause permanent damage. But after a lot of therapy and time I was able to recognize that sex is something fun that makes you feel close to other people. I think a relationship is when you find someone who is the only person you want to feel so close to. I'm in a serious relationship, and for some reason (I actually don't know why) he is the only person I want to be with. I love him, I love being with him, and I love when we have sex. So if sex is all good warm soft things, then why would being a girl who has lots of sex, or in my situation used to have lots of sex, be a bad or shameful thing?
