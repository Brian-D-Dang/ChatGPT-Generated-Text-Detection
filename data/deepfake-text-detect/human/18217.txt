The idea of a society of upper most homogeneity and conformity, where every role is valued - there is no shame in being a house wife or a working man - and there are few divisions in terms of things like sexuality (as in attraction, not your sex), race, culture or inheritable mentalphysical deficiencies which gives way for a harmonious society. There is a strong leader leading the people in a common spirit of national solidarity, politics are essentially technocratic and even if things people today often consider essential liberties are sacrificed, it is for the greater happiness and good of the people.
