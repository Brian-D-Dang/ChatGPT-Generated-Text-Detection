I believe this because over the past few weeks I've been surveying this idea, and I've noticed some things. If you ever get on the road, anytime before 6, 7, or 8 p.m., etc. (quitting time), you'll notice that most everyone in their cars are older people. Rarely do you see teenagers in them, and if you do, they have friends in there, so you'd have to assume that they're going out to have fun, and not to work. Whenever I've had a job, I'm always surrounded by people in their 30's, 40's, and sometimes even older than that. So the question I would have after all this, is: Do teens have any business looking for employment at their age? Even after they leave college, you still hear about them having a tough time finding work. So where does the problem lie? How can we fix this? The newer, younger generation is growing up, and soon we'll take over. How soon? Not soon enough...
