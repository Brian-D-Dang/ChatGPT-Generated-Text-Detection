i really dig this place for its uniqueness and the sushi. you'll find several one-of-a-kind sushi recipes here, and so far I've found them all to be delicious. when your sushi is served, you can tell right away that the people preparing it care. it looks beautiful and the taste matches. no fishy smell at this place, either a big plus for a sushi bar, imo. definitely worth a try.
