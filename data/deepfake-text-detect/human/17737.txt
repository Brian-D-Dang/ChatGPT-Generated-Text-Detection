No one starts counting at zero. We don't say that children are "zero years old," nor do we say that I have "zero cars." Yes, in Europe,, et al., it is referred to as the "ground floor" or "rez de chaussee," etc. However, the ground floor is indeed the first floor in a building, non? Every language has multiple ways of referring to the zero floor, so it would make it simpler for travelers to have a universal reference ie, the first floor. Would the average Sri Lankan know what is "rez de chaussee"? Probably not. But she would know what is "Floor 1." Furthermore, if you ask how many floors there are in a 10-storey building, the answer is 10. "Hold on, this elevator only goes up to the 9th floor... What about the 10th floor???" "Well, the first floor is called 'planta baja." "Well, why don't you just call it the 'first floor', then?" Possible counter-argument: when buildings have basements or subterranean parking garages (sorry, "car parks, they are called 1," 2," etc, which pre-supposes that there must also be a "zero" floor. However, labeling these floors as -1 is also illogical because I also cannot have -1 cars, -3 shirts, etc. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
