Allow me to answer in one word: Corruption', "Actually, if you're going to dump a load of money into a place by building hotels, facilities, etc. doesn't it make sense to dump it into a place that needs revitalization?," "It's fairly common knowledge that these organisations are very corrupt, taking bribes and such.," "Most modernized cities don't want the Olympics to be hosted locally. It destabilizes the economy, causes crime and riots, and all the deals end up giving the cities a huge debt. The Olympics usually take whoever they can, because there are some cities that are willing to take those losses (they already have high crime or something), in exchange for a quick chance to get some infrastructure and facilities built.
