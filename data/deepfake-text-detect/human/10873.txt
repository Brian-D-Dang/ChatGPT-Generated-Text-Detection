Neutrons act as a bufferglue between the positive charges in the nucleus. When you group two or more protons in a tight space (like the nucleus) they will repel each other due to the fact that they are both positive. This repulsion, along with the attraction of the protons to the electrons in the outer shell will make atoms unstable. Neutrons group with the protons and hold them in place with a force called Strong nuclear force. This is the strongest natural force in physics. So, when you start losing neutrons, the overall force holding the nucleus together diminishes, making the protons repulsive forces towards each other able to overcome the strong nuclear force of the remaining neutrons, making the nucleus unstable.
