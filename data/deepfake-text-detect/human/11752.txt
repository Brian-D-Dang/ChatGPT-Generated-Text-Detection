Voice is a new social media platform that rewards its users for quality content. It is based on the EOS blockchain. Users on the platform are rewarded with Voice tokens for posting quality content. Voice's launch was delayed as the company changed CEOs and split off from Block.one to become its own company. The platform is now available to the public to browse. Users who want to publish content will have to register.
