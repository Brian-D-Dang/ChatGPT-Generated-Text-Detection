I've been following the NHL and NBA pretty closely this season, and I noticed that there have been a TON of game 7s, and most of them have gotten down to the wire in the end. That got me thinking: it would benefit the networks to try to force a game 7 through either the players (gagged by contract) andor refs (also gagged by contract). There are a ton of viewers for pro sports playoffs, and more people would obviously watch if there were seven games, thus making the networks more money. But wait! It would also benefit the networks to keep the game down to the wire so that fans would continue watching until the end. In a society where money talks more than anything else, it's hard for me to see why the networks wouldn't try to control this. This idea (which I thought of last week) has changed the way I enjoy sports, and kinda lessens the intensity and authenticity. Can someone CMV and get me to take off my tinfoil hat?
