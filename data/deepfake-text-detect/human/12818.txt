Bent down and straightening the row of shoes in front of the mirror, I saw her move a second too soon. I rolled my eyes, finished straightening, and stood back up. Placing my hand on my hips, I stared her down and she glared right back. "Slow the fuck down, will you?" I said not kindly. It's always like this with her. She lacks the patience necessary to make it in this life. She's always rushing and leaving a mess behind for me to clean up, not thinking at all before she acts, even on the smallest of impulses. "But I want to go! Fuck the shoes. Who cares if they're neat? Who cares if they're both pointing inward? Only you that's who." She has the petulance of an unripened tomato plant at the height of summer. I wish I could squash her and leave her to rot, but I'm stuck with her it seems. "It's not about the shoes. It's about doing things right. Keeping order. Nothing you would know about." I suppose it's only fair to admit I share at least a little of her ill-humored attitude. "Keeping order? Are you serious. You're the one talking to yourself," she said snidely. "Oh, shut up. Come on. It's Monday. You know what that means Yes, yes, lets go polish the kitchen floors you boring old cow. I know you wont be able to sleep otherwise," she said with a heavy eye roll. At least there aren't any mirrors in the kitchen, I swore I heard her say as she left the frame.
