When I'd pulled the hatch closed on my backyard fallout shelter, I'd felt a strange combination of relief and superiority. Everyone had thought I was nuts, excavating the ground, putting in the corrugated steel habitats, spending tens of thousands of dollars on water purification and storage systems, hydroponic gardens, and the like. When the sirens started to wail, I was mere steps from my salvation. I had all the time in the world to pick up what I wanted to take with me, head into the back yard, and seal myself in before the bombs fell. I wish I'd picked up the damned plunger.
