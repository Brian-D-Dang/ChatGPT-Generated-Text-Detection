After exhausting all the standard approaches, we'd traveled to Arizona to meet Dr. Christo Milonas, a Memory Loss specialist who had some unorthodox techniques. My mom hadn't reacted well to the doctor's suggestion. "Reading?" Dr. Milonas smiled, probably having had this conversation hundreds of times before. "Yes. Josh needs to learn to read and write." "But he's only nine years old! You want a child to learn to read? That would be absurd even for a child without ML." "Mrs. Smith, you've traveled thousands of miles to come see me. At least listen for a few minutes." My mom said nothing, which Dr. Milonas took as his cue to continue. "I've found that children as young as six can learn to read and write with the same proficiency as a college reading or writing major. In fact, they learn even faster than college students due to the plasticity of their young minds." My mom still wasn't convincend. "Okay, let's pretend for a moment that Josh can learn to read. How could it possibly help? It's not like there are jobs for readers or writers." "Whenever Josh learns something important, he can write it down. And when he wants to remember that thing, he can read what he's written. By doing so he'll be able to remember just as well as anyone else. There are even a number of techniques to do mathematics using a pen and paper." "Pen?" "Oh sorry. It's a type of writing equipment." Now my mom was a bit worried. "I'm not sure we can afford specialized equipment. Will our insurance cover it?"
