We live in a world that is no longer 9-5. Businesses stay open later, friends can reach us with a portable device simply by typing on a mini keyboard. It doesn't make sense that public transportation isn't 247. Here are some reasons why it should be 247: 1. Very few buses run at 2 am for last call, I feel like if nothing else, running buses later let's responsible drunk people take public transit instead of driving home. 2. It would benefit the working poor who may work night shift 3. As mentioned before our world is now 247 Those are my arguments. I encourage you all to change my view Edit: by transit I am including trains, buses, all forms of public transportation, not just buses. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
