Let me be clear. I do not think all cops are corrupt or bent towards hurting people for racial or classist reasons. I do however think that anyone who signs up for the type of work police officers do has to be more than just okay with the possibility of violence. I think somewhere in their hearts they want to hurt the bad guy for the greater good. I simply don't buy the argument that they never want to have to be violent, but (sigh) circumstances being what they are call for it. Violence is a major tool in their trade, but they're not allowed to say that is it one of the many reasons they signed up to be an officer. Let me reiterate that I do not hate cops and am quite happy I live a country with a strong and mostly non corrupt police force. I just think they like the idea of being violent for the state.
