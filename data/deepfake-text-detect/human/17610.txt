(For the sake of argument, I will focus on U.S. Deaf culture, as that is what I am most familiar with) I am a hearing person with some knowledge of Deaf culture, which "tend[s] to view deafness as a difference in human experience rather than a disability." (Wikipedia). However, I have trouble believing that deaf people are not significantly disadvantaged compared to hearing people in a number of aspects. Morally I'm uncomfortable with this view, but logically I find it difficult to accept any other view. I feel Deaf people will experience unique disadvantages in the following (and other) areas: Educational: Being deaf limits a person's education to either: a) attending a Sign Language school, whereif it is an option at allteachers are more likely to be trained with an emphasis on special education rather than the subject material, or b) attending a hearing school with the aid of an interpreter. Professional: For obvious reasons, employers may not want to hire someone who would have a difficult time communicating with other employees or customers when a hearing person would be able to do the same job. I agree that this is unethical, but the fact that it happens is undeniable and supported by the significant increase in unemployment in deaf individuals versus hearing individuals. SocialPersonal: The low number of people who sign fluently or are familiar with Deaf issues would, I imagine, make it more difficult for deaf individuals to find others with whom to socialize with, or even to carry out day-to-day tasks. Please understand that I am not trying to offend Deaf individuals or say that I view them as lesser people; on the contrary, I'm trying to better understand how Deaf people operate in day-to-day life, the struggles they do and do not face, and hopefully in doing so this dialogue will increase awareness of these issues among hearing people as well.
