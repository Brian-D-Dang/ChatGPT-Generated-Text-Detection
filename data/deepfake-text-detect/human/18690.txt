There deals can be pretty good, but ... 1. Their site is constantly slow. When there is a sale, it gets even slower. I can't even get X-COM from the site right now because it's too damn slow. 2. They constantly run out of keys during sales. 3. The people running the site don't seem skilled enough to keep things going smoothly. For example, there was the great Bethesda blunder because some programmer wrote bad code. All-in-all, I think GamersGate is significantly lower quality than other digital games retailers. The website simply sucks. Imagine walking into a shitty market that constantly runs out of certain food items, whose cash register keeps breaking, and is unable to fit too many shoppers. That's what GG is like. Please CMV.
