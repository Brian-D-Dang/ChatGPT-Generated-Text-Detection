Delicious, but expensive. Dined here a few weeks ago and I just remembered right now how awesome the dinner rolls were. They looked sweet from the glaze on top, but there was salt sprinkled on top. Came here during Pacquiao-Cotto fight weekend so excitement was in the air at MGM. The restaurant was packed and everybody looked like they were having a good time. With our party of 6, most of us ordered the surf and turf deal with respective sides. My gf and I got that along with the carrots and risotto. Take note that the sides are HUGE and definitely family style. The filet mignon and shrimp was satisfying. After feasting, we ended the night with chocolate souffle and ridiculous sized serving of coffee. Each person got their own french press! 6 people 750. If you're looking for a lower priced steakhouse with a celebrity chef, I'd highly recommend StripSteak by Michael Mina at Mandalay.
