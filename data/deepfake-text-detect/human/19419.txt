I'm not talking about the merits of the argument for or against intelligent design, and I know why they had to choose something besides "creationism," but "intelligent design" seems like an incredibly bad choice, and has always bothered me. "Intelligent" pretty much means "smart the way humans are smart." Basically something is intelligent if it acts like us, and some of us are more intelligent than others. "Design" is what humans do when we think about how to build something before we actually build it. So, "intelligent design" seems to mean "things that look like they were made by humans." Except that the way we know something has been designed is that it doesn't look natural and "intelligent design" is supposed to apply to everything that's natural. It seems like the name completely contradicts the concept it's supposed to describe. It should be something like "super-intelligent design" or maybe even better "non-human designed" or even "non-intelligent design" would actually make sense.
