Zoom has bought security start-up Keybase, which will allow it to implement end-to-end encryption in its meetings. Users will not be able to call into encrypted meetings via phone, and cloud-based recording will be disabled. The encryption key will not be held on Zoom servers. It will take some time to implement Keybase's technology into Zoom's software. Encrypted Zoom calls will be a paid service.
