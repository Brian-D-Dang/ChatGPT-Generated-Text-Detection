Capt. Gale waited patiently at the entrance to her spacecraft. The passengers were just embarking for the trip to Mars. There were the usually types of people preparing for the flight to Mars. Rich people wanting something out of the ordinary. Powerful people trying to be impressive. Even after all this time, she still felt out of place. But her simple mid-western upbringing also tended to charm the guests. After exchanging pleasantries with the passengers, she left them in the hands of the flight attendants. Sometimes it seemed silly, all the prep work took longer than the actual trip. She entered the cockpit. If you could call it that. The cockpit really didn't look like anything you'd expect. There was no acceleration couches or anything. Just a small dais patterned with a simple red and yellow spiral. Once everyone got into their seats, one of the flight attendants rung her up on the comm panel. "Everything is green. Ready for transport." Dorothy stepped to the center of the dais, clicked the heels of her Ruby slippers and said "There's no place like Mars."
