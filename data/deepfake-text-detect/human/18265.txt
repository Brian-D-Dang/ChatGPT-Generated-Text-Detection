As someone who is diagnosed with ADHD-PI (predominately inattentive), or what most would refer to as ADD, and is currently taking medication for it, I firmly believe in the existence of the disordercondition. I notice a very big difference when I haven't taken the medication that day. And if personal experience weren't enough, research I've previously done indicates that ADHD is a real and legitimate medical disorder, even if the cause is largely unknown.
