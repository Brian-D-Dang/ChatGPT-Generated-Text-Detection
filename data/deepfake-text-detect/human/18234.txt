There has been this unbelievable flood of posts and comments about how the Travyon Martin case should be only between the parties directly involved and that it should be treated just like any other murder of a black person. I disagree with that for three reasons: First, the Travyon Martin case is de facto not "just another case" because it gathered national attention. People argue that this is because of the media (which is partially true) but they forget that the reason it first attracted attention was because Zimmerman was on a neighbourhood watch. It raised questions about whether practices such as the neighbourhood watch and being allowed to carry a firearm led to the death of Travyon Martin. Second, while it is very difficult to argue that Zimmerman should have been ruled guilty for happened that night that does not mean that the fairness of self defence or gun control laws should not be debated. What is legal is not always right and, more importantly, what is legal does not reflect the views of the community about what should be allowed. Also, it is viewer and reader attention (at least in this case) that lead the media to sensationalize the story which should also raise questions about how we, as consumers of media information reacted to the death of Martin.
