Every year we hear complaining about unfair business practices about making working these two days mandatory. People organize strikeswalkouts, demand higher pay, etc etc. I mean sitting in the break room complaining about working a shitty shift I understand, we all complain. I'm talking about organized protests. Plenty of people work those two days. Fast food workers, cops, firefighters, pilots, EMTs, doctors, nurses, the military, waitresses, cooks, snow removal agencies, taxis, bus drivers - I could go on but you get the point. A lot of people work those two days. I've never shopped on black friday at a brick and mortar store, but if people want to go nuts for 50 an item marked up 50, let them. As long as no one is getting hurt, I don't see a problem. And if you take a retail job, working Thanksgiving isn't going to be a surprise to you. It would be like taking a job at McDonalds and then complaining when you have to work the fryer. Yes, it's busy. I imagine it's a lot of work. But it's no different than what millions of people do every year on the same days. Striking because you think it's unfair is retarded. edit: I'll be back in a few hours. The arguments are all the same, essentially: 1) "You haven't worked retail." Yes. I have. 2) "There is no NEED for retailers to be open that day" - That's fine. BF isn't a holiday. Why shouldn't they be open? They make a shit load of money that day. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
