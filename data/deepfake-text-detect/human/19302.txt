So, first off, I am a die hard-liberal on pretty much every issue... except the death penalty. I am largely really anti-conservative, I'm a huge advocate for gay rights, equal pay, etc. However, ever since I was a little kid, I have always thought the death penalty is an acceptable form of punishment for a person who has committed a heinous crime and has been proven guilty beyond any reasonable doubt. I'm a pretty firm believer in an eye for an eye, which I know isn't the way to solve things, but I feel is just. If someone rapes and kills children, IMO, they deserve to die. If they kill many people, I don't care how mentally ill they are, they deserve to die. And I know that people usually say they'd rather a person rot in prison than die and get off easy, but death row inmates spend years in prison before they are killed. I found this website that was the final statement of every death row inmate before they were executed, and I found it only strengthened my view. I can't see a more fitting punishment than death for a crime worthy of the death penalty. Now, to be clear, I only see the death penalty as appropriate for really terrible crimes. As I said already, rape andor murder of kids, serial killings, proven acts of terrorism (through fair trial, I despise Guantanamo) that resulted in multiple deaths, and really violent or twisted premeditated murders. I don't think a guy who snapped and shot his wife deserves to die, I think he deserves life in prison. I think a guy who murdered his entire family in cold blood deserves to die. Anyway, I feel like this can't be a good way to think. I'm liberal on pretty much every other issue and would like to become so on this one too. That said, I'm pretty firmly set in my ways. So, reddit, CMV.
