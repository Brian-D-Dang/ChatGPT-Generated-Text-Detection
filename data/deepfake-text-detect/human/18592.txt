A more extreme version of that view that I believe, but am not as attached to holding, is that I think that people should be desensitized at a young age. Let me provide some backstory on what I mean. When I was around 12, I decided I would watch all the major shock videos on the Internet so that I wouldn't get disturbed by that sort of thing. The main shock videos I refer to include sexual depravity videos (e.g., 2 Girls 1 Cup) and then the violent ones (3 Guys 1 Hammer), or a mix of the two (BME Pain Olympics). As a result, I constantly find myself in situations such as watching movies with friends, and a torture scene will come up and everyone else will shriek what not, and I always stay perfectly calm. I like to think that this means that I have a much more objective view of situations, and don't do things like morally judge people just because theyre into something traditionally considered "disgusting." I think it's also important to be able to keep yourself composed in a situation where your emotional reactions are challenged. EDIT: I should point out that not reacting emotionally to something doesn't mean youre not reacting to it. While yes, I do judge people, I try to basis my judgements on legitimate character flaws (I don't think there's a single way I can possibly word that sentence without sounding self absorbed). Or for another example, if I saw a video of a murder and was asked to sentence the murderer, while I wouldn't react with, "HOW HORRIBLE, HE'S A MURDERER," I can still assess that murder is both unethical and detrimental to society.
