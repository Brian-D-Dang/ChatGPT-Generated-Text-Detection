The man had left the medals on a work surface to clean before leaving his home in Wootton Park, Bristol, only to find on his return that they had vanished. It is thought someone entered the house via a rear door on the afternoon of 22 June. Avon and Somerset Police are appealing for help in tracing the items. Among the collection of medals was a bronze 1939-45 star, a bronze France and Germany star and a police long service medal. The medals were were engraved with the victim's name, the regimental number and 5th Battalion Coldstream Guards. A silver and green French Legion d'Honneur medal - the highest decoration bestowed by the French state - and a black wallet with gold lettering in the bottom right corner were also taken.
