I don't support the death penalty because of the hypocrisy behind it. I also believe that time for rehabilitation is more important than punishement. Humans imo should help each other out and not go out of their way to hurt each other, and if someone does go out of their way to hurt someone else, there is a motive behind it, whether it's external or internal. Considering the fact that everyone is different, with rehabilitation, we can find out what made that individual do what they did, and possibly prevent such behavior from happening in the future, allowing them to become a productive member of society.
