I don't think there is some thing that humans were put on earth to do. All of the theories I've heard had to do with other people, religion, or egotistical 'we have to fix everything because only we can' stuff. I think that there is no reason for life, and that people should do what they want without worrying about whether or not they're doing what they are supposed to in order to fulfill some higher purpose. It just doesn't make sense to me for there to be some reason we're all here, or even a reason why each person is here. We're here because of evolution and a natural urge to procreate, and nothing else.
