I really liked this place! They have several options for pedicures-some organic products even used. But, the REAL reason I was so impressed by this place was the quality of their manicure! How many times have you gotten a manicure and like, literally, that week your nails chipped? (the answer is all the time) So, imagine my surprise when my manicure lasted almost 2 weeks! This is the regular run of the mill manicure that I received and it was awesome. Everything else was pretty standard for a salonthe people were really nice, it was clean, etc. My only tip: the new hot trend is to offer a free beverage;) Just a tip.
