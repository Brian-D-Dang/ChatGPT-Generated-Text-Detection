I might be a black sheep on this, but I actually like Sandai alot. I can see that a lot of the reviews are prior to 2011, so maybe they changed management and improved a lot of things. Ever since I've been going here since February of 2011 I've had great food and OK service (not exceptionally good but not bad at all either). To be honest, I'm shocked to see they have only a one and a half star rating on Yelp! So I'm here to give in my little two cents. First off, the venue is pretty small, but cozy. The maximum capacity of the dining room is probably less than 25, so that may give you a rough idea how small it is. The only thing I ever get from here is either the blood sausage soup (Soon-Dae Guk) or the cold noodles (Chin Naeg Myung). I got the soup mostly on chilly February March days and the cold noodle is excellent on a hot summer day. The blood sausage soup is not spicy, but served extremely hot. I am absolutely a huge fan of cold noodles, and I can say Sandai comes close to having the best cold noodles in Las Vegas (and better than ones I've had in L.A.). I've heard Mother's Grill has great noodles, but I haven't tried theirs yet. Sandai's cold noodles is way better than DJK's in my opinon. I just love the authentic North Korean taste it has (for the record, the owners are South Korean. And, for the record, I'm South Korean as well). North Korean cold noodle style has a more tangy flavor that I'm more fond of, and the noodles are served thin to my liking. I hate how some cold noodles are served with too much MSG, or the noodles are too thick at other venues. I hope I shed some light on this restaurant. The service I get is good, food never fails to disappoint, and they know I'm a common face in the restaurant so they treat me pretty well. I can't speak for any of their other dishes, but if you're a fan of cold noodles you have got to try Sandai.
