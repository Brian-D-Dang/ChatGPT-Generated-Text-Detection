There are a few things presidents, congressional representatives and senators can do to influence the growth or shrinkage of the economy. Some politicians claim that tax cuts stimulate the economy, others claim that increased government spending (while keeping taxation the same) simulates the economy, but there is no consensus on this point, among economists or politicians. Deficit spending stimulates the economy, but we are already deficit spending, and the national debt is already rather large, so we can't do that forever. Low interest rates stimulate the economy, but elected officials have no direct influence over interest rates the Federal Reserve Board does that, and interest rates are already very, very low. New export markets also help, but the U.S. is already committed to several ambitious international trade agreements. Investor confidence helps, a little, maybe, sometimes, but the U.S. stock market is already overpriced. Beyond that, most economic growth comes from increases in productivity, and consumer confidence. Elected officials have no control over these. If you vote for a candidate who promises to "create jobs" or "grow the economy," you're either voting for a liar or a fool. Change my view! Edit: I'm speaking of the U.S. economy, not the global economy, and I'm speaking of political candidates who might run for office in the near future, not the distant future or the past.
