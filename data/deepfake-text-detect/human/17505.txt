I honestly can't see why this isn't done. Marriage is a religious construct, and we do our best (at least in the US) to separate religion and state. Individuals can get married by their church, but they should be entered into a civil union from the perspective of the government. The only argument I've heard that I can sympathize with is that this will lead to further expansion of the definition of a civil union, to eventually allow polyamorous groups to gain the rights of a civil union. I personally don't have an issue with this either, but I suppose I can understand why some people may. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
