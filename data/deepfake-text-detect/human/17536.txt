For years, people would drive after over-consuming alcohol and be pulled over without significant ramifications. Currently, I believe society is now overcompensating. The cost of a DUI for guilty individuals is spiraling out of control. People are forced to endure barbaric public shaming (in some states) and treated as if they were a child molester. Far more people drive over the arbitrary limit than most realize. I did have a family member pass away due to complications with a drunk driver and it was a extremely sad situation. The driver was punished because of the circumstances, and it was a choice that will impact the person's life forever. For me, knowing the person realized they were a factor in killing someone was punishment enough. Other friends and family were much more negative. However, I also know good people who have been pretty much ruined - i.e. career, lifestyle, family, and health - because of one mistake. The issue is complicated and needs to be addressed, but I believe we cannot allow individual emotions and degenerative organizations (MADD) to influence law. Ultimately, this needs to become a serious conversation where we can enact fair consequences depending on circumstances, redirect fines toward health concerns instead of police departments, and figure out community service-based solutions rather than stigmatizing criminal records. It will be hard to change my view on this, but I think it's a conversation that needs to happen soon.
