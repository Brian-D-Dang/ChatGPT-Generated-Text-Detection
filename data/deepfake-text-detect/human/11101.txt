The Euro is a common currency. If the EU decides that the only way the Euro can survive the Greek economic collapse is to have Greece out of the Euro (and back to a national currency, such as the drachma), then other countries confidence in the future of the Euro will not be as strong. It will be those countries which believe their economies are especially strong which will be the first ones to react, and take themselves out of the Euro to defend their own economy. For instance, if Germany decides that being in the Euro is more harmful for its economy in the long run, it may decide it's not worth being in. Then, other countries will follow suit. One problem for English-language press is that much of the press of Great Britain has long been Euro-skeptic, and they tend to cheer on any news which suggests the Euro is doing poorly. This time, however, they may be right.," "Many countries have leant Greece lots of money, especially France and Germany, to keep it afloat. If Greece was to default on its debts, especially if done so disorderly, than Germany in particular would be out of pocket by billions of Euro. This would have a huge knock effect, causing interest rates to soar, and making it very difficult for countries like Portugal, Italy and Ireland to pay back there debts. If they can't, then France and the UK - the other 2 major lenders - will have potentially lost billions as well. Very quickly, there could be a handful of bankrupt countries, and the three biggest economies in the EU with losses of 100s of billions combined to soak up.
