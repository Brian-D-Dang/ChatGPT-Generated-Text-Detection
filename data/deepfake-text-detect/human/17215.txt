I understand that Voter ID laws in the US tend to disenfranchise the poor, urban citizens, and minorities, and thus are, in practice, more of a tool used by the right to keep Democrats away from the poles. But, while I absolutely believe the Republican party pushes Voter ID laws for malicious and selfish reasons, I can't help but feel that it's the right thing to do in and of thing. With voting such an important rite in our society (whether it's treated that way or not), it seems odd to not protect it from abuse and be sure that every person's voice is heard equally.
