Cabotage is the practice of allowing foreign airlines to operate domestic routes. Currently, if your airline is not headquartered in the United States, you can't fly between two US cities. So Air Canada can fly a plane from Toronto to New York, but can't continue that plane on to Miami. I think this rule is dumb and protectionist. [Airline safety and protocols are subject to international treaties already,] and if we wanted, foreign airlines could be subjected to additional FAA safety checks as a condition of being allowed to engage in cabotage. With the current state of the US airline industry being [so close-knit as to promote collusion,] a healthy dose of competition seems like it's in order. Opening up cabotage would allow a lot more competition in US aviation, which would be a big benefit to consumers as far as price. It would also likely allow a lot of airports which aren't presently hubs to get better overseas service. For instance, British Airways might not be able to justify a direct flight from Cleveland or St Louis to London, but it might be able to justify a flight that does St Louis - Cleveland - London.
