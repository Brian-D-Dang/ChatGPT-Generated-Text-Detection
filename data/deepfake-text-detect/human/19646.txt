I think that if a person is likely to experience more pain or discomfort than pleasure and happiness for the rest of his life, then suicide is a logical and justified thing to do. However, I do believe that many people who attempt or consider attempting suicide have bad judgements in the moment because of depression, panic attacks, drugs, etc. I think that we almost always advise people not to kill themselves because (a) we personally don't want them to die, (b) we legitimately believe that they'd be better off alive, and (c) we don't want to be responsible for their deaths. I also believe that suicide can be immoral because it negatively effects victims' friends and families. CMV
