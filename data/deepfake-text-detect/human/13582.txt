Carlos and Ruben walked home from school together every day. They would terrorize the girls in their neighborhood on the way home. Their favorite trick was to hide and then jump out to scare the girls. Sometimes they even threw rocks at the poor girls. Jeff was a boy scout who had his hands full walking scared girls home.
