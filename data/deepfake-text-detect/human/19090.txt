The main reason I hate expression of religion (and mostly organized expression of religion) is because of the prejudices it can cause. I believe religion is the main cause of homofobia and a strong factor in other forms of discrimination. Just because religion tells them so people ostracize the things their religion tells them to or even just anyone who disagrees. Yes this might be very black-and-white viewed, but so much discrimination is andor was brought forth out of religion. So much times has it been abused for it's power of organizing people, crusades, wars, genocides. One can't think about WWII (the strong nationalism back then can easily be considered as a sort of religion in my opinion) without the genocide of the jews, homosexuals and mentally handicapped or anyone who disagreed with them. Or for example the Islamic State. I know religion has also done good things but to me it seems they don't even come close to weighting out the bad. Especially as a gay man I can't talk to a religious person without having a tenfolded fear of how they will respond when they know I'm gay. My view feels very toxic and hateful, but I have difficulty changing it. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
