Posting on my secondary for obvious reasons I grew up in a extremely abusive house. I dreaded coming home and the site of my mom made my heart skip a beat. Just the sound of her voice made all hairs on my body rise like a cat. Everyday, physically and mentally, she'd wale on me. I knew if I wanted, if I truly wanted to, I could easily defend myself. I was defiantly in a situation where if we replaced my mom with literally any other human on Earth I would have broke their jaw. She'd pin me against a wall and call me a fag and hit me and hurt me, and I'd take it. Every. Last. Hit. The only thing that every stopped me was knowing I wasn't allowed to. I never knew why, but I knew I couldn't. Because of some fucked up child memories, to this day I still can't take a photo of myself without breaking down or look myself in the eyes or even say I'm "happy." She would call me a sadist and a pessimist, and as years came on I slowly developed these personas. My entire life revolves around the time I spent with her. I cant even count how many times I've wanted to kill myself. I dont say this to attention-whore my way into your web browser, but to use my story as a example. Child abuse fucks people up, badly. I believe the best way to avoid this is to allow a child to hit his parents back, strictly in self defense alone
