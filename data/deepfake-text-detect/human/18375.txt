I believe love is a choice whether it is in a relationship with a SO or with a friend or between a parent and child or even an object. "Falling in love" is a phrase used quite often but I believe it creates a fantastical idea of the love that is unhealthy. If I were to say I fell in love with someone or something, then in essence I would be saying something beyond my own power caused me to love that person or object whether I wanted to or not. I came to this conclusion studying theology and philosophy. I first learned about the struggle between Calvinism and Arminianism and also between freewill and determinism, and I questioned how a God would just determine a certain amount of people to be in heaven. I realized after struggling for a couple months that love is a choice because those people also must choose to love God and also even that God does not have to love anyone but he chooses to love people. So there is more freewill both on the individual's part and on God's part. It also seems to make more sense to me as I get to know both my girlfriend and parents more. There are some things about my girlfriend that I would not mind changing or that I do not like very much and the same goes for my parents. But despite their faults, I remind myself that I have chosen to love her and am choosing to love them as well. In this way, I think love as a choice is far greater than "falling in love" because I do not have to love my girlfriend or parents, but I choose to love them.
