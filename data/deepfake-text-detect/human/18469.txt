With globalization and trading of ideas between cultures there is a large amount of culture appropriation from outside nations and countries around the world are loosing their musical heirtage. I come from India and the music that is heard now a days in movies (for those that don't know, most Indian music comes from films not typically from individual singers or bands) is awfully westernized to the point where half the lyrics are English. And the meaning or interpretation behind the music is understood by everyone where as before people needed to generally learn or inform themselves on the culture to understand why certain pieces were sung or performed the way are. It has turned into almost stereotypical music, with very little influence going back the other direction. As time goes on more songs have partial or full english lyrics. Instruments such as the guitar (electric or otherwise) have been integrated. So I want to know, how exactly do you think your country or another country whose culture you are familiar with has not lost its roots and still retains those aspects in MODERN music, none of this "oh a teeny tiny population still listens to classical music." Hopefully I didn't ramble too much and made some sense. This is my first one but definitely not my last one!:) Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
