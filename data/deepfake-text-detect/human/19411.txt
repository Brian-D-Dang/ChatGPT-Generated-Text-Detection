Almost by default, a single parent sees less of their children then a dual parent household. They must both work and raise their children all by themselves, while a dual parent household can have 1 working parent and 1 stay at home parent. Also, a single parent may not be the best role model for a child. For instance, a single mother may not be an adequate replacement for a father for a young boy, and vice verse for a single father and his daughter. Also single parent households are generally poorer than dual parent ones, which again makes the children's life more difficult.
