I've only seen the first episode, admittedly, so my criticism comes from there. Sherlock comes off as sociopathic, which I'm fine with, except that the whole tone of the show implies that he's the best person around, with all the cops acting stupidly to make the audience root for Sherlock whenever he acts dickishly. It seems to be lionizing this disgusting person, by putting him up against strawmen and letting him act like Gregory House. But whereas House was treated as unpleasant and really flawed as a human (though worthy of some respect), Sherlock's evils are never really shown as a problem. Elementary (also mediocre in its own way) plays with a similar character, but shows Holmes' unpleasantness as the impediment to happiness that they are. He alienates his friends, he ruins Watson's car, and he achieves nothing when he throws his temper tantrum. The creators want us to be amused by his behavior, but not to regard it as the right thing to do. In contrast, Sherlock's creators really seem to be trying to make Sherlock look cool for what he does. Besides that, the first episode's mystery - strangely, for an adaptation of a series founded on logical, rational detective work - is never actually justified; it's an unnecessary loose end (provoking another one of Sherlock's adolescent outbursts). And Cumberbatch's Holmes is rather forgettable as a character, compared to Jeremy Brett's utterly enthralling performance from the Granada series. Besides all that, the show just seemed to drag on and lacked momentum. Still, I've heard enough praise for the series that I'd like to think that I'm missing something. So, CMV?
