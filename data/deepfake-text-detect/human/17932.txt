The intro and music was ultra cheesy and just plain not good, and I was left wondering who the hell the director was the whole episode, and not in a good way. I truly don't give a shit what happens to the Governor after the events of the last season. He is a psychopath without a chance of redemption. I only just watched it, three days after it aired, and the series specific subreddit is already upvoted full of people that disagree with me so there's no chance of intelligent conversation. I love the show and its premise, so change my view about this episode.
