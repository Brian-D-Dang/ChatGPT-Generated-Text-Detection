Not thinking that much about designer babys and more about things which can be objectively improved, mainly: physical condition and cognitive abilities. I don't know how far away we are from being able to do so, but I think when we are, we should absolutely do it. Evolution is quit a slow process and if we could accelerate that, while sticking to nearly unarguably good stuff like thinking faster, have better memory etc. I don't see why we shouldn't do so. A two-classes community (directly translated from german, hope you get it) might or will probably be a temporary result and I realize it sounds a lot like some of the things people tried to do which had quit a bad influence on our history, but once we know enough about it and use it with responsibility, well why not? People I talked about to this didn't really like it, let's see what reddit has to say.
