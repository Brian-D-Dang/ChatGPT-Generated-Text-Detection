The only way to actually make a brownie is to have it be Fudgie. Anyone who makes a cake-y brownie had no idea what they are doing. If you want chocolate cake, make a cake. Don't try to say that your light and airy frosted dessert is a brownie, when it is actually just a non tall cake. The only true brownies are ones that are gooey and Fudgie. Take your leavened flour monstrosity and call it what it really is, a square too short cake. Edit: Disgusting might be too harsh a word to describe my hatred of cake like brownies. Experiencing ennui is probably a better description of what I feel when eating the cake like brownie. Our maybe severe disappointment. But I will say that Fudgie type brownies are the best kind. Some people might add other things into the brownie, and I will admit that can sometimes add to the experience. It ultimately comes down to the consistency of the brownie whether or not it is enjoyable. The thicker the consistency the better. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
