(US) If you buy a house or other real estate property through a loan from a bank, you're still just a tenant. You don't own it. You're not the owner unless you build it or buy it free and clear. Banks try to brainwash home "buyers" into thinking that they'll be the owners as soon as they have approval and title and start making payments. The security incentive to "buy" a piece of real estate, as opposed to renting, is virtually nil. I've had people try to explain it to me, but I've failed to see how there is any advantage to buying over renting unless you buy the whole thing. It seems to actually be less secure and more complicated. When I tell people it seems it would be better to save up and actually, literally buy a house if that's what you want, they just tell me it's not how the world works. I know I'm being inarticulate and conspicuously ignorant in this post, but I never take "That's (not) how the world works" at face value. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
