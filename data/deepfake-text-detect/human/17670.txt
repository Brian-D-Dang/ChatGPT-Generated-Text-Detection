Based on my understanding of the US constitution, the only real argument against incestuous marriage is that the children might be at risk due to inbreeding. With same-sex marriages that concern does not exist, so it would be unconstitutional to disallow incestuous same-sex marriages for that reason. After same-sex incestuous marriages are allowed, it becomes a violation of equal protection to disallow opposite-sex marriages. There might be some issues relating to family power dynamics, but I'm not sure if that is enough of a justification to deny marriage. Also I could see courts saying that opposite-sex incestuous couples are in a different position from same-sex couples, but I don't see that holding water. CMV Hello, users of CMV!
