In today's society, most adults dont approve of "kids" having sex, whether it be from a religious standpoint, or they argue that they are too young. And it seems like today, it's happening more and more. Hell, they even made a tv show about it. I believe that this rise in sexuality from people generally ages 14 is completely normal and alright. I believe that just like any mamals, we instinctively want to mate, so our sex drives are high. Now, I'm sure we can all agree (or can we?) that time's a'changin'. And as our cultures develop, we start to see more and more activity from younger people. I think this is because as this transitional period between generations is happening, especially with more and more people drifting away from religionbecoming even easier and more accessible for kids to have sex. Naturally, given the ability, of course they're going to have sex. Theyre trying to expand the species. I do however think that the stopping of the spread of STI's and other deseases is vital, also preventing unwanted pregnancies. Change my view.
