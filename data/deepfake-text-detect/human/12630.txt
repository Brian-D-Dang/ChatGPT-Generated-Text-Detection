Yep, they call me the memlar. To be honest, I think the name lacks a lot of creativity. But hey, what can I say. The majority of humanity is stupid anyways, I doubt they could come up with something better if they racked their brains for 24 hours straight. It's one of the reasons I hate humanity, god are they stupid. I'm one of the very few that are capable of functioning normally. Memes, however, memes are perfect. I feel this deep connection with them, especially Pepe. He shows his emotions and he isn't afraid of anything. I think about him sometimes when I'm feeling down, which happens a lot here in prison. God, I shouldn't even be here. The judge didn't listen to my side of the story. Goddamn humans. I kill the stupidest to save the sanity of those like me, and draw memes on their backs to accompany them to heaven, or whatever it is that they believe in. It's very humane, if you ask me. They say I'm in here for life, but Pepe has my back, and I know it. He's gon na get me out of here. I shared my cell with a guy who recently got released, and he called me insane for talking to Pepe every night. He doesn't know shit. He's the stupidest of all, and when I get out, he better watch his back. I'm coming for him, Pepe by my side..
