Ever since 911, I find that both the government and media exaggerate "threats" in order to push a certain agenda. This appears to be the case with the most recent call by the department of Homeland Security for airlines to watch out for "toothpaste tube bombs" ahead of the 2014 Sochi Olympics. As of today, this "threat" is being covered by most media outlets I've crossed. My concerns are as follows. 1) Informing the general public is useless and harmful. Airport security is designed for the explicit purpose of identifying threats prior to boarding an airplane. There's nothing new about it. Furthermore, security should expect potential threats to increasedecrease based on external events (i.e. Olympics, G8UN assemblies, Holidays). Security teams take the appropriate measures to ensure nothing goes wrong so what good does it do to announce these threats to the general public? If there were such threats, wouldn't it be better to keep this information internal and investigate without causing harm or scaring the general public? Even if I saw someone with toothpaste in the airport, I wouldn't think of doing anything based on the likelihood that it would be a bomb. On the flip side, doing something would create an unnecessary scare that would cause delays for travellers. The proper authorities are the only ones that should have this type of power, anything else creates unnecessary chaos. 2) From the media coverage I've seen, there appears to be a lack of proof. How can they make such harmful claims (damaging reputation of Olympics Russia, decrease ticket revenue of the olympics and airlines, etc..) without providing any evidence of the potential threat? I'm no security pro or anything but it's been more than 10 years since 911 and I honestly believe this type of fear mongering is harmful to society. We should all be aware of the potential threats around us but I don't think we need the government and the media taking every opportunity to scare the public. CMV.
