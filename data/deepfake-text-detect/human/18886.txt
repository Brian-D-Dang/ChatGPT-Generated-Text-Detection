When I say non-essential, I mean things that are not providing food, water, shelter, or health-related services to the less fortunate. While I think that the desire to help people in non-essential ways is great and should be encouraged through specific volunteer work, I simply cannot see a justification for charities that provide toys to children in Africa when there are children in the next village over who will die from malnutrition or dehydration. I believe that all the money that goes to such charities should be repurposed for meeting the basic needs of all people before it can enrich the lives of those who are already, by definition, more fortunate. I recognize that this is an unpopular view. I am friends with many who monetarily support charities such as Operation Christmas Child but no charities meeting the basic needs of the impoverished, and I have been met with anger and opposition when trying to express my views and to understand why they ought to be changed.
