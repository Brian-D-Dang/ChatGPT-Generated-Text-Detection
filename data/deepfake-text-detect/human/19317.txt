23, male, non-married. I have several younger family members under the age of 10 and find spending time with them or other children to be boring, counterproductive, or simply aggravating. I understand children are important to us as developing individuals but I can't find value in the time I spend with them, especially given how difficult younger ones can be to simply even talk to. I find infants insufferable and hate being around them, detest baby talk to the point of instant infuration, and have little patience for toddlers. I want to share and interact with them, especially to teach them or mentor them but I can't stomach being unable to level with younger kids. I find that many people stigmatize others that dislike children unfairly - please help change my view.
