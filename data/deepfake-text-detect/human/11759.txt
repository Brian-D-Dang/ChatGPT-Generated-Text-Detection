MIT announced that it is planning a 1 billion college called the MIT Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing, named after Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman who donated 350 million. The new college will create an additional 50 faculty positions. MIT's president L. Rafael Reif says that the goal is to "educate the bilinguals of the future," meaning people in fields like biology, chemistry, politics, history and linguistics who are also knowledgeable about computing. Former Google CEO and visiting innovation fellow Eric Schmidt says "It's a major fund-raising mechanism that gives M.I.T. a huge resource to apply A.I. to other fields."
