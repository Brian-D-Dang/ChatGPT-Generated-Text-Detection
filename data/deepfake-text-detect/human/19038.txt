Most people, most of the time, rather than form an unbiased opinion (if such a thing even exists) about a certain issue, actually form their position due to emotional reasons - a gut feeling, if you will. (Edit: Please disregard my title; it is too general, whereas the last sentence presents my claim more precisely.) This is most evident when, for example, two people with differing views discuss politics. Each person will justify their opinion on ostensibly rational grounds. However, most political discussions end with both parties saying what amounts to "Your arguments are less convincing than mine." There is some "meta" reason causing the person to be more open to certain arguments than others, and that meta reason, which is the actual reason for the person's opinion, is not rational.
