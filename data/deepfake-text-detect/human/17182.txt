I find myself annoyed constantly when people talk badly about people in powerauthority, the obvious example being politicians, moderators, service providers when they can't themselves either do any better or contribute positively. In the instance of a difficult social topic that many people have varying views on, I think that people are far too stuck in their ways of thought that they themselves can't understand how difficult it is to find a solution which everybody is happy with. I find that people, such as my parents are too biased towards or against a particular political party or a sporting team that they are blinded towards any negatives or positives a person may be contributing. I realised I had this view when a redditor was challenging the integrity and motive of a service provided by a person who made a website (in a gaming context) designed to help people understand prices in the game, but made the point that they could be manipulating prices and was terribly designed, etc. and I basically told him that he shouldn't say anything like that if he couldn't make a better website or something along those lines, which he pointed out was an ad hominem fallacy. I still find myself believing this, but would like my view changed. So please, CMV. edit: Thanks for the replies, basically what I've realised is that while it annoys me, there is no way to stop pointless criticism (so that is pointless) and that criticism is usually constructive and has its own separate merit to producing.
