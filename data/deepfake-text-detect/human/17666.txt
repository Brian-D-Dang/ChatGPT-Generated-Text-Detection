I really don't understand why she is so glorified. I understand she is " funny " and hot but really, why does she receive such huge attention. I don't know why she got an Oscar, i've seen her movie and i don't think at all that it was a perfomance merit to an oscar. I can picture her as a really funny ordinary person from my schooljob wich would never receive such a huge attention. Don't get me wrong, i think she is a really nice person
