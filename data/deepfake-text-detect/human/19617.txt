I work for clients in the security industry, and used to work in the security industry myself. As far as I've seen, securitythe police do not increase our safety at all. No matter how far they take it, there will always be a way to hurt people or steal from them. I see all the money spent on police and security as an opportunity cost, and believe that we are actually making ourselves less safe by choosing to give that money to them rather than spend it on education programs, job training programs, mental health programs, etc.
