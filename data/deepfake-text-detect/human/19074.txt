First of all, let's assume Christianity is true, or otherwise the whole thread's going to be "none of it matters, since it's all fake." I believe that all of the different offshoots of Christianity, such as Catholicism and the various types of Protestantism (Lutheran, Baptist, Presbyterian, etc) are all completely interchangeable. If you look at the book of Romans, it says "If you declare with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved," boom, that's it. As long as the denomination believes that, then every other denomination-specific rule (like Baptists not dancing) does not matter in the slightest. There shouldn't be any big to-do over different denominations, since they're all saved as long as they agree on the fundamental aspect of Christianity: Jesus was God in human form, He died to absolve us of sin, He rose from the dead. Change my view.
