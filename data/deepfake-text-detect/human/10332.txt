Improv, as an art form, is a medium almost exclusively to be enjoyed live. SNL, while having improvised elements, does not fall in this category because most skits are rehearsed (regardless of your current feelings on the show, it has worked to some degree of success in the past). Which brings me to Whose Line. The show, while being very clever and featuring undoubtedly skilled performers, just does not translate through television. This is where my argument will get a little murky, because I'm not entirely sure why it doesn't translate. It would seem to follow that something that's funny in person would also be funny through television. I just know that when experienced live, improv has such a bigger effect on its audience than when seen on television. The show, as a result suffered, ratings began to falter, and it was subsequently cancelled. In the aftermath, redditors began praising the show for its genius, claiming how it was unjustly cancelled, etc, etc, Colin Mochrie, etc. Reddit simply pretends to like it because of its unpopularity and cancellation, because that then elevates that redditor above the general public. "Normal people just don't'get it.' But I do," kind of thing. I know this is entirely subjective, and you may think I'm completely off base, but I'd really like to get genuine responses of why you enjoy the show, why you believe it is actually funny, and whether or not there is any truth to my assumption of reddit's reasons for liking it. Change my view.
