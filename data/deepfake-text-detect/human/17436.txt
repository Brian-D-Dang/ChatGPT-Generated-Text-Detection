This little piece of news is blowing up all over the gaming media. [Steam introduced paid Workshop Mods.] People are freaking out all over the gaming subs. [RIP PC gaming (the beginning of the end) ] [STEAM IS NOW SELLING MODS???] [And the rgames thread, with a less hyperbolic title, still has many many people afraid of this change.] I don't see anything really wrong with this concept. It incentivizes more people into doing modding. With the possibility of being paid for your work, there's greater motivation for doing it. Many people burn out from doing free work because of how entitled the people are who use their work. I've seen it a lot in the Android modding community on xda-developers, so I don't imagine that this behavior of entitlement doesn't also exist in many gaming mod communities. You have a much, much larger platform for getting your work out with Valve's support, as compared to third-party modding forums and websites. Players were never entitled to mods being free in the first place, and this new addition doesn't change the fact that modders can still release free mods if they want to. Players were never entitled to updates regardless. What you pay for is the product as is. One person in the rgames thread was worried that if you buy a mod it might not work in the future. Well, you're not paying for continual support, you're paying for the product as you see it. It works the same way with literally every app on iTunes or the Google Play Store. (Of course, people there still complain that they deserve continuous updates.) So, CMV that there's something wrong with the concept of a paid modding platform on Steam. (Not looking to debate whether or not Valve can follow through with all their promises and keep thieves off of the market and so forth, as this has just begun rolling out so we can't compare it to other online marketplaces yet. If there's something problematic they've stated that I've missed, though, feel free to point it out).
