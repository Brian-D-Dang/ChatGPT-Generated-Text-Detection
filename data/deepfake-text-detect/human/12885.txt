I am not a hero. I am a pissed off slender teenager with a big stick. Malkendis stole my magic. I don't know how, and I don't care. All I know is that he's somewhere up north in a place called The Obsidian Vault. Yeah, it's a pretty melodramatic name. Wizards have a penchant for melodrama. I'm not travelling alone. I have my club, of course. I won it from an ogre in a game of riddles. I tried using a sword, but I didn't have the skill to make it cut. I figure that if I carry around a heavy cudgel, I won't need too much practice to leave some nasty bruises on whoever annoys me. I also have Gerris, the talking goat. When Malkendis took my magic, some of it overflowed and changed Gerris' nature. Now, he follows me and criticizes my every decision. He also eats all my supplies. I truly, truly hate him. And last of all I have the spirit in the ring, which says nothing and does nothing. I only know he is there because I feel him comfort me when I am distraught. Malkendis stole my magic because he thought I was weak and foolish, and because he thought I would not seek revenge. But I am no longer the petty mage who cursed his pillow to be warm on both sides. I am a pissed off slender teenager with a big stick.
