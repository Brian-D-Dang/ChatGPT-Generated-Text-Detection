Bill lay panting on the damp earth beside the partially collapsed building. The body of his friend lay still several feet to the side. The can lay directly between them, blood slowly drying on its surface. He had used it as an impromptu weapon, bashing Jake in his head in a fit of defensive rage. It HAD been his can. He had spotted it first. Usually they shared their finds. But Bill had been so hungry. When Jake made a lunge for it he reacted without thinking, the resulting scuffle ended with Bill slamming the can forcefully into Jake's skull. Jake had not moved since. Bill got onto his hands and knees, and slowly crawled his way towards Jake, snagging the dented blood encrusted can on the way. He settled down next to his friend, checking for a pulse. Dead. Bill lowered his head, becoming overwhelmed with the emotions one can expect to feel when confronted with something terrible they had done. But the awful pain in his stomach continued. He was ravenous, he was hungry, starving. He and Jake had not eaten in several days. It was either him or me Bill rationalized through the fog of hunger. Bill held the can in trembling hands, thankful that soon he would get the nourishment his body craved. With unsteady hands Bill wrestled to pull open the tab off the top of the can. Bill jerked his head back as the can's lid flung open, immediately followed by several brightly colored snakes. Bill sighed, setting the can beside his dead friend. He sunk down onto the bare earth, and closed his eyes and waited for death to come.
