The pulse? caused by cycling changes of blood pressure as blood flows in the arteries. Commonly felt on the wrist, neck, upper arm, and sometimes inner thigh.', "Our mind usually ignores sensory information that is somewhat permanent or persistent. The brain is specialized to recognize changes. For example: we don't see our nose when we have both eyes open although it is right there in our visual field, or hear our blood rushing through our veins. The same applies to our heartbeat. At a constant rate, we usually don't recognize it. We start noticing it, when it tends to become unusual highstrongirregular. And since our heart is basically a pump, that pushes blood through our body, we theoretically can feel the heartbeat everywhere in our body.... given that the heart rate changes significantly, so our brain recognizes the change or the part is more sensitive due to an injury (like a burning or sth. like that).,Your heart is beating faster for whatever reason, and your position or physical activity affect blood vessels so the specific body part gets more blood.
