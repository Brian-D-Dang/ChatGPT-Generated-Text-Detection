The hostesses were less than friendly, close to being rude. We waited over 75 minutes for a table, but there were 13 people so we expected to wait. Honestly it wasn't worth it though. The food was overpriced although the steak sandwich 33 was pretty tasty. The Frozen hot chocolate was like drinking chocolate milk with lots of whipped cream for 12!
