Let me start by saying that I typically tend to think of myself as a pretty open minded individual. I believe homosexuals should have equal marriage rights and have had a few friends that have been homosexual. With transgender people I do not believe that they have an equivalent standing with homosexuals. I beleive that they suffer from a mental illness similar to schizophrenia or dissociative identity disorder and should be classified as such and we should attempt to find treatment for them. Body part dissociation under any other circumstance would be classified as a mental or neurological disorder. If a person believes that their hand is not their hand but belongs to someone else we treat them accordingly. We do not allow them to cut off their hand through elective surgery. For some reason when someone believes they are of a different gender we allow them to use elective surgery to mutilate and alter their bodies. Simply put I beleive there is something wrong in the wiring of transgender individuals brains and we would do better trying to find a cure or medications rather than allowing them to mutilate their bodies and placing them into the same sphere as homosexuals and bisexuals Please CMV.
