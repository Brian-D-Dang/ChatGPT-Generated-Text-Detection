John was baking a pie, when his weather alarm started going off. He barely had time to even look at it when the earthquake struck. It lasted for about 30 seconds, and when it was finished, all he heard was a deep, loud roaring seeming to come from within the ground. Running out of his house, John saw people yelling and rushing towards the City Hall. He saw his neighbor, Diane looking around with a panicked expression, so John waved to her. As she walked over, the roaring abruptly stopped and the ground seemed to vibrate for a few seconds. "Did you hear it? The roaring?" Diane said. "Yes, it was the only thing I could hear." John said "Come look at my phone, the government is broadcasting a message!" Diane exclaimed. "The earth is alive? What does this mean?" John questioned. As abruptly as the roaring stopped previously, it started again, even louder. Overhead, what appeared to be around ten military jets flew to where the roar appeared to be emanating from. A few seconds later, John and Diane were knocked back onto the ground from the force of what must have been some sort of nuclear bomb. Then came the tentacles, out of the earth's crust itself, grabbing jets and helicopters out of the air and throwing them onto the ground.
