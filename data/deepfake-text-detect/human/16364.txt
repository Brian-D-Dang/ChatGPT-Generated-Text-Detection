Following a lengthy legal battle with the European Commission, which deemed the exclusivity of the rights to be against the interests of competition and the consumer, BSkyB's monopoly came to an end from the 2007-08 season. In May 2006, the Irish broadcaster Setanta Sports was awarded two of the six Premier League packages that the English FA offered to broadcasters. Sky picked up the remaining four for PS1.3bn. In February 2015, Sky bid PS4.2bn for a package of 120 premier league games across the three seasons from 2016. This represented an increase of 70 on the previous contract and was said to be PS1bn more than the company had expected to pay. The move has been followed by staff cuts, increased subscription prices (including 9 in Sky's family package) and the dropping of the 3D channel.
