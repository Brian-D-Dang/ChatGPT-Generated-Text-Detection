I don't really have a biological understanding of the modern interpretation of gender and have developed this view purely out deductive reasoning. It seems to me that we have developed an understanding of afflictions, such as [alien hand syndrome] , where those who are affected believe that part of themselves are actually alien to their body. We are also developing an idea of how people who are anorexic or bulimic almost certainly view their bodies in such a way that is not representative of reality and often harm themselves in attempts to lose weight. We, as a society, have decided that these are sick individuals who need medical and psychiatric attention. Certainly, an individual with alien hand syndrome could have a procedure to remove their hand in a safe and controlled environment and continue living a suitable life. We don't allow that, though. How is having gender identity issues different from afflictions I have described above? Also, why are these individuals allowed to make unnecessary changes to their body when we don't provide the same liberties to others? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
