Though my personal political views match those of Bernie Sanders much more than Hillary Clinton, I believe nominating Bernie could ultimately be very damaging for the progressive cause. My main concern with nominating Sanders is that he will alienate all voters except for the left and the end result will be a 48-state Reagan v. Mondale style steamrolling. A GOP presidency, possible supermajority in both houses and 1-3 supreme court nominations could be enough to nullify the limited progress we've had under Obama. A Clinton presidency would probably look very similar to Obama's, and come with a lot of disappointments. I do think it's possible that we might see progress towards things like a single-payer healthcare system that progressives have wanted all along. I like Bernie a lot, and would like to vote for him so please CMV. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
