The Trojans stood at the gate, wondering what to do with the lovely offering presented by the Greeks. As they were about to bring it inside the city, a strange man suddenly appeared out of nowhere in a flash. "STOP!" he yelled. "THE HORSE IS A TRAP!" "Who is this man?" the Trojans began to murmur. "He must be a god!" they concluded. With this conclusion, the Trojan general opened the rear compartment of the horse and outpoured the Greek soldiers, killing the general. This was not a wise move, since they were severely outnumbered and then slaughtered. "The general is dead!" yelled a Trojan soldier. "All hail the new general!" he pointed to the man who had appeared, but as strangely as he had appeared, he had now disappeared, as strangely as he had come. When the time traveller arrived back in the future, he noticed many statues that looked exactly like him. To his horror, he realised he was living in the land of Troy.
