"I'm going to live forever or die trying" "It's often an excuse used by most people to persevere and achieve the unachievable, beat the unbeatable or do the impossible. The path to establishing your own legacy is a treacherous one yet one that tastes sweet when overcome. I do believe you have made it through, sir. You are the very definition of a legacy. " , the doctor mumbled, trying so desperately hard to contain his sadness. "I sure hope so. Sir, if I may speak, I wish you to understand the true principles of government. I wish them carried out. I ask nothing more " , he blurted out with what little strength he has remaining "Yes sir. You shall live forever not in this earth but on our hearts and minds. " , the doctor spoke with utmost confidence "I am satisfied. " And with that, William Henry Harrison drew his last breath. He passed, knowing that he lives on until to this day.
