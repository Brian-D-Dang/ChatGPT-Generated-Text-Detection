FRD is pretty much an average bar without much to distunguish it aside from being stumbling distance from home. They have poker a couple times a week as well as karaoke along with a band evey once in a while. They've an ok to fair selection of beer (no Guinness shockingly enough) and liquor. The food is tolerable for bar food, but I have had much better at other bars. Service happens to depend who's on duty. Some of their bartenders have been awesome while others...well, not so much. Overall, if you're looking for a place to toss back a few, play some poker or sing some karaoke in an okay but not necessarily stunning place and you're close by, check it out. Not a place I'd suggest if you've got to cross town for or want a higher end glitzy establishment though.
