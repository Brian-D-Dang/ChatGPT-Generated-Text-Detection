[Here's a link to the said act.] As stated in the [Declaration of Independence] , " Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form" The Smith Act directly goes against such principle. While, AFAIK, the Declaration of Independence is not a legally binding document, I believe that the Smith Act fundamentally undermines the will of the Founding Fathers.
