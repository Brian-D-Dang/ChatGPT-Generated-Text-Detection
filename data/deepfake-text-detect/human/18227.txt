We will never "lift" the world's poor up without lowering our style of living. We can't bring others up to the level of even the "poor" in America. When our poorest (not counting the homeless) are millionaires compared to the poor worldwide how do we end that? Do we lower the worldwide standards of living so that we are all semi-poor? The is no way to provide jobs to help these people to rise above abject poverty. Otherwise we just make half the world welfare cases and there is no way to pay for that kind of endeavor. We will never make everyone equal in regards to racism, sexism or bigotry. There will always be something to be used as a tool of bigotry. Eye color, if we were all of the same skin tone. Hair color. Left or right handiness. Male. Female. Gay. Bi. Hetero. Whatever. There will always be something to divide. Change my view. I'll check back in the AM. I'm not abandoning my own CMV.
