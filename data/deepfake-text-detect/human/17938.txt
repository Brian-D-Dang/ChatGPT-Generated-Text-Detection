IS seems to be an expression of nationalism, which is, historically, a powerful force that can't be contained. Muslims of the Middle East particularly need an inspiring group identity because their civilization has been falling behind for centuries. If we try to stand in the way, the outcome will not be what we want. When has dropping bombs ever made anyone less extreme? Peace makes people nicer, not war. Let's wait until things settle down, at which point the West can influence them in the way that actually works: by peaceful cultural contact. Trade. Student exchange. Entertainment. Tourism. Scientific and military collaboration. Intermarriage. I know how terrifying IS is and I acknowledge that some military action might do more good than harm, but the overall approach should be cultural rather than military. The West had a hand in making the Middle East such a mess. We overthrew democracies and propped up dictators friendly to us. We distorted their economies with our hunger for oil. Now we bomb them because they're trying their own thing? It's not right.
