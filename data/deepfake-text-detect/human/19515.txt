The Unabomber, [Ted Kaczynski] , in his manifesto (which can be found here , criticizes the Industrial Revolution for harming mankind, producing the Left (which he describes as people with inferiority complexes who attempt to assert power when they are powerless), weakening humanity's rapport with nature and producing generations of goalless, powerless people. His manifesto has convinced me that Kaczynski was right about his analysis of society, and that the only solution is to bring about a serious revolution immediately, gradually convince the rest of the world, or wait for a catastrophe so that we are forced to work for our food, whether it be through hunting or farming. Mankind would not be bored, and thus create artificial goals, if we have natural goals that we must achieve. With all this said, CMV please! Hello, users of CMV!
