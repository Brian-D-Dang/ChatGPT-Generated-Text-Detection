I remember seeing an askreddit post about what sex was like for both partners when one of them is a post-op trans person, that eventually devolved into an argument about disclosure. I feel that if you are uncomfortable with dating a trans person, it is your responsibility to ask the other person if they are trans or otherwise make it known that you do not wish to date trans people. After all if you're the one with a preference in a romantic partner, it is your responsibility to make that preference known to the other involved. I feel that if this makes it harder for you to get dates that is just the price that you have to pay for the ability to maintain your preferenceavoid accidentally falling in love with a trans person.
