Google is completely reimagining mobile search. It is adding a newsfeed to its mobile search results, with news cards that look a lot like the Google News App (or Facebook, Reddit, any of these apps that use the square card design on mobile). It's also using computer vision to add more visuals to search, including a new Stories feature, which creates an auto-advancing carousel of videos, showing just the relevant section of each video. Another feature called "collections" is coming this fall, it will allow you to bookmark search results into a special viewer, where Google will also surface content suggestions. Think of it like Pinterest, but for Google search.
