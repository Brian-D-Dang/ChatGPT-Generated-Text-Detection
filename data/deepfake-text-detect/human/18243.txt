The most common reason for tattoos is self-expression, which makes sense. They are intended to stimulate a certain social perception that is in some way emotionally rewarding to person with the tattoo. In my experience, tattoos are usually social signals that the person is youthful andor present minded, belonging to a certain social grouping, andor especially sentimental about the object of the tattoo's symbolism. Self-esteem is usually highly tied to one's own perception of their social importance. Thus, on this basis tattoos increase self-esteem in some manner because social importance should be synonymous with the type of social reward they are trying to get from people. All this seems reasonable because everyone wears clothing, drives nice cars, has nice houses, buys nice things, socializes with certain people, etc... all usually with the purpose of increasing this aspect of self-esteem. But getting a tattoo seems somehow more extreme. If I suddenly decided to commit to wearing one T-shirt with a specific design on it from now until the day I died (assuming I could wash it or buy an exact duplicate), I think that the level of sacrifice in terms of my commitment to a specific thing would seem a bit of a relatively extreme method for acquiring that self esteem. The tattoo should signal that you are willing to risk the fad fading, it looking bad in old age, that you will be signalling lower social status, and thus that you are not overly intelligent for taking these serious ramifications so lightly. Relative to all the other ways we get self-esteem, does getting a tattoo not seem relatively desperate? Since desperation is usually not a socially desirable quality, shouldn't tattoos be less prevalent than they are now? This is all based on a lot of "usuals" I realize.
