Off the beaten path...Sunset Road..but easy to find ad it is on the main drag...This place has home deco and finishing statement pieces which would add glamour and a touch of class for any home. Plan on spending a while - especially of ypu want to see ot all. The jewelry is worth ckecking out. For Costume babbles with good designs in ALL colors. Much better than the run of the mill stores in Vegas malls. And MUCH. BETTER PRICES! This is a fun store with a great variety of items. They always seem to be restocking with new items. Also ocassionally in the front of the parking lot you may find a food vendor selling Indian Fry Bread.
