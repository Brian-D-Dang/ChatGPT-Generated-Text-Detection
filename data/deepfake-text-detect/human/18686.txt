Children who are from broken homes or who are adopted are statistically less likely to succeed. When comparing homosexual couples who adopt to heterosexual couples with their own children, the test is already flawed before it begins. Essentially this is like testing who can swim better: People with blonde hair or people with brown hair. If you put 45 pound weights on the backs of every blonde person, your study will appear to show that brown-haired people can swim better than blonde-haired people. If you want to answer the question: What is the difference in parenting between homosexual couples and heterosexual couples? You have to give a fair study. A more fair and equal study would be to compare two groups of homosexual and heterosexual couples with similar educational backgrounds, economic status, etc, and both groups of whom adopt children. Comparing homosexual couples who adopt children to traditional heterosexual couples who have children of their own is not a fair study because the circumstances are not the same. We are comparing homosexual vs heterosexual parenting but we are putting them in different environments, one of which very definitively shows more negative results, whether it involves homosexual or heterosexual families. Another good study would be to compare homosexual couples who have their own biological children via surrogate, and compare them with heterosexual couples with their own biological children whether through a surrogate or with their partner. With this said, I believe that all "studies" or statistics dealing with homosexual parenting vs heterosexual parenting is flawed at best, and outright misinformation and propaganda at worst. CMV
