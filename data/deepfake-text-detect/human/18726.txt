EDIT: "Devolving" is not a real term, "Regressing" is a better way of saying what I'm trying to say. The process of evolution relies very heavily on natural selection. In order for evolution to take place, even slightly weaker members of a species must die young or not be able to procreate. Ever since the advent of agriculture and organized human civilization, dumber, weaker, and genetically inferior humans have been able to survive to puberty and procreate. Today, the most intelligent and powerful members of society have few children, sometimes none. While the weakest members (like the idiots who end up on the Maury Povich Show) pop out dozens of children. There is scientific evidence to suggest that humans during the time of Ancient Greece had, on average, HIGHER IQs than we do today. Humanity is regressing.
