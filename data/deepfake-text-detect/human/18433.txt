My argument is simple: A lot of what the Bible says is usually taken as analogy or metaphor for a deeper truth and way of life. Most people don't think that Jesus was actually pissed off at a fig tree; they see it as a parable for how people should live their lives. Most people honestly don't even think that God literally created the Earth in 6 days, even though Genesis says that; they believe that the days are representative of a longer time span and "create" can mean put into action through evolution. The Bible is full of verses that most major Christian sects do not take literally. So why is it that almost all Christians take Jesus literally when he says that one must believe in him to ascend to heaven? Couldn't Jesus be speaking in analogies as well? The proof I have always been shown is a passage in John where Jesus says "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." I don't see why that can't be taken as a general analogy instead of literally. Perhaps when he says "through me," he means by doing good deeds and following God's ideal through action instead of simply believing in him. It would then follow that whoever lives a good life will ascend to heaven. Obviously I'm not saying this is absolutely true or anything, honestly I'm not even a Christian. But I'm surprised that almost every Christian sect I know strongly believes that you must literally say "Yes Jesus is my savior" to enter heaven. They refuse to think outside the box at all and consider it may be an analogy - even as they look at other Biblical statements and accept that they may be analogies. I hope this makes sense. I look forward to anyone trying to change my view. TL;DR: The Bible is full of analogies and most Christians accept that. They should also be willing to accept that it may be an analogy when Christ says that one must "believe in him" to come to Heaven. It's possible and likely that he did not mean that literally. CMV
