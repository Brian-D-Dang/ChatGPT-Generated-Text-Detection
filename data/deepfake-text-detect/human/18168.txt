Don't get me wrong, I personally think that net neutrality is a great thing and like the internet how it is. But I don't think that anyone necessarily has a right to enforce corporations to sell a particular service to the public. To me, the argument comes down basically to wether or not Internet is a public utility, like electricity, water and telephone service; or is internet just a widely used private service, like Google, for example. While some would baselessly argue that the internet was a product of public endeavour and government research - Obama and Al Gore, for example, yet in terms of actual facts, the internet was a product of university research and private investment. Sure the government helped, but they weren't responsible. The internet is a private industry that came from private research and private investment. Now, since it's so widespread and massively used by the public, they want to label it a public utility, and let the public control a private industry. To me, this is no different than if people hypothetically decided since everyone uses Google, and it can be nearly impossible to efficiently navigate the web without it, it is a public utility too; does the public have a right to stop Google from letting entities pay more to allow their results to show up higher on the search page? Google developed a superior technology and on top of that allows the public to use their service for free. Shouldn't they decide what service they provide, not the public? Or if a particular restaurant chain became so huge that nearly everyone used the service, should the public be allowed to stop them from making changes to the services they provide? I don't think so, because the public didn't create the service, so they shouldn't control it. I like the open web too, but do I have a right to it? Change my view. TL;DR: Net neutrality is nice, but I don't think the public truly has a right to control private companies. Edit: sorry glitch
