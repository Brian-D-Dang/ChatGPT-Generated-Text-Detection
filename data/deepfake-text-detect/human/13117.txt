I dwell forever among the mortals. Each one knows me, but acknowledge me not. There is one mortal who is a seeker; and this one seeks me out. The mortal has sought me out but could find me not; as I was hidden where the mortal would not dare to look. Now the time is come that I am revealed. A deep sleep was arising over the mortal, and I made my presence known. I breathed and the body shook, my gaze broke through the mind and seared through the heart. The mortal spoke to me: Mortal: Are you the one I seek? Are you God? God: Who is this'I' that seeks? Mortal: It is me. God: Who are you? Mortal: I am a human. God: Who is this'I' that is human? Mortal: I am. God: What is this'I'? Mortal: It is my self. God: From where does the self arise? Mortal: (after a long pause) I suppose that it arises from you. I then shook the mortal awake; and I appeared fully onto him. I said unto him: I am you; and you are I My presence swept the mortal away. I watched him fall before me; and I remained alone.
