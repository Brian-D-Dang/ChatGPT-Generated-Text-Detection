As long as I've been alive, I've always poured milk before cereal. I've done this because I am a textural eater and I hate soggy cereal. I believe that pouring milk first provides more time to eat fresh cereal. It seems though, that most of the world, including 99 of my friends, does it the other way; no one has provided me with an explanation as to why I should do it otherwise. However, they sure do like to judge the way I like to prepare my cereal. Please give me a legitimate reason to consider otherwise (besides just your preference for soggy cereal, which I won't even consider given that I don't like soggy cereal). EDIT: Thanks to all the people that posted replies. To be honest, I don't know if my view has completely changed, but I definitely recognize the validity of cereal first. It seems that it is a more efficient to obtain the "perfect milk to cereal ratio." However, I think that is all due to preference and for those that don't really know how much milk or cereal they want. I guess the best way I can explain my own preference for milk first is similar to soup. I pour the soup in before adding croutons or something. I still welcome further discussion, but I will have to sign off for now since I'm at work. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
