I am not a religious or spiritual individual by any means. That said, I do think there are some things that we will never understand not because science is flawed, but because human beings are and will be physically incapable of ever knowing or understanding certain things, such as what happened before the Big Bang (because it violates our laws of physics and reality) and what triggers life and consciousness. The Ship of Theseus is a classic analogy that has been debated for centuries. Basically, there is a ship which, over many years, has every last piece of wood and metal replaced at one point or another. After a few years, the entire ship consists of materials that were not present originally. Is it the same ship? I say it is, because it holds certain characteristics and is regarded as the same. It's the same case as with the physical human body for the most part (being composed of different cells). In any case, because science cannot explain consciousness and life (not due to divine intervention per se, but because it is simply beyond the realm of our comprehension). So what I'd like to be convinced of is that it isn't the same ship, and for that to be reconciled with the consciousness analogy. Merely stating it is not a valid analogy is not adequate if you intend to do that, disregard the ship and simply focus on human consciousness. Is there something I am missing about how consciousness is in some ways separate from the body? I don't believe that people have "souls" that exist outside the body and that live when your body dies, but still. Of course, there is connection, as brain activity can be measured and physical interaction with the brain can affect what it does (obviously). So what is it? tl;dr: I think there's something in us that is not entirely material. Some people might call it a "soul," and I just call it consciousness. CMV.
