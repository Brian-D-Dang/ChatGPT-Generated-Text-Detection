I think all these protest and rallies have small or no impact on what government officials really do or think. Huge protest like the "occupy movement" really didn't do anything other then put police brutality into light but was there actually anything done about it. Gay rights rallies happen all over the country yet, only a handful of states have legal same-sex marriage. Protest happen almost everyday outside the white house yet we rarely hear about them and they are usually just shrugged off. Protesting is close to pointless in The United States of America.
