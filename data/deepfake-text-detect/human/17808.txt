This is not about Obamacare, specifically- although I'm in favor of socialized medicine, there are issues with how that bill is constructed that give me pause. Also, it would be easy to get mired down in the intricacies of the law, and that's a whole different thread altogether. What I'd like to know is this; can anyone give me a compelling reason why we, as a country, should NOT offer socialized medicine? If it's financial, show me the numbers. If it's science, show me papers. Opinion? Well, that's fine - but compel me. My perspective: Covering all the uninsured in this country would [cost less than 1 of the GDP, raising health care spending about 5] overall. We have all heard the stories about people with insurance still having to go through bankruptcy because of severe health issues and incomplete coverage. We've also heard of folks dying from rotten teeth because they can't afford a dentist. The folks who can't pay have their tab picked up by the taxpayer - so we really are already paying for healthcare.... just not in any kind of a good way. It's financially irresponsible, heartless, and really really weird when you look at it objectively. Why not do this? If nothing else, we already have Medicaid in place.... why not expand that?
