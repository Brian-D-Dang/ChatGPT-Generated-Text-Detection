The game was released in'98 for Nintendo 64. Just think back a few years (circa 5) ssd was a miracle. Now go back to 98. Back then you needed very little resources to run things. If the game was to be remade it would have much nicer graphics and effects, shaders, pixel detail, anti aliasing and what not. Now on to facebook, the actual app has 47-48 mb. The rest is all the pictures, posts and what not that you see on the'front page' of facebook. Have you ever tried checking facebook with no internet connection? You'll be able to scroll down the'front page' and view pictures, posts, whatever that you saw the last time you had Wi-Fi. Some videos might play too. It all gets stored on your phone and you can delete that by going into settings apps select app delete data. This is for Android though.," "In the old days memory use was a significant concern. For example, when pokemon Red, Blue and Green were being finalized they were so short on memory that they had to remove all debug tools to even fit in Mew. The old games had to be optimized to hell and back just to fit the cartridge. Nowadays that is not a concern, unless it's extreme the memory use just isn't relevant. The dev team can freely add features to the app and not care if they're not particularly optimized.
