Signal estimation problems with smoothness and sparsity priors can be naturally modeled as quadratic optimization with l 0 norm" constraints. Since such problems are non-convex and hard-to-solve, the standard approach is, instead, to tackle their convex surrogates based on l 1 -norm relaxations. In this paper, we propose new iterative (convex) conic quadratic relaxations that exploit not only the l 0 norm" terms, but also the fitness and smoothness functions. The iterative convexification approach substantially closes the gap between the l 0 norm" and its l 1 surrogate. These stronger relaxations lead to significantly better estimators than l 1 -norm approaches and also allow one to utilize affine sparsity priors. In addition, the parameters of the model and the resulting estimators are easily interpretable. Experiments with a tailored Lagrangian decomposition method indicate that the proposed iterative convex relaxations yield solutions within 1 of the exact l 0 approach, and can tackle instances with up to 100,000 variables under one minute.
