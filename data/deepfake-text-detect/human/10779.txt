I think the others here are missing what OP is asking... WHY does it go love, 15, 30, 40, instead of just 0, 1, 2, 3. I watched something on ESPN that said originally, way back when in medieval France, scores were kept on a clock, so it was originally 15, 30, 45. Later it was changed to 40 for the sake of giving more room on the clock for deuces (each adv was 10 min). As for love.... it's close to the French word for egg, which resembles a zero. Not sure how true that one is, but that's the only theory that I've heard.
