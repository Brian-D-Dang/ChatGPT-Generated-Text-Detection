A research doctorate in engineering is an expansion of human knowledge. You have to create something or develop a technique that no one has ever done before, that is reproducible, and that is valuable to society. Engineering PhDs are shaping modern society and changing the world. We're making education accessible to everyone, we're improving modern medicine and making that accessible to everyone. We are literally extending human life. I genuinely don't know what a doctorate in medieval literature requires or contributes. I don't know what it's value is. And so I judge it as being less valuable. I could be completely wrong! I'm just saying that I'm ignorant to its value. CMV
