The united states was created more than two hundred years ago, and, in that time, our society has undergone some of the fastest change in history. I do not believe their views are necessarily still relevant today, and that an argument I'm which one uses them is an appeal to authority that does not make sense. Instead, an argument should focus on the merits of a position, instead of a person's possible opinion who died in a different era. Note: I'm not saying the founding fathers did not have any good (or still possibly relevant) ideas, but that an argument based off of the founding fathers' possible disagreement with a current position has no merit on its own.
