In my area salt use has quadrupled in the past 15 years. I think many people don't realize just how much salt is dumped into the environment or recognize that even though it's not highly toxic, it is damaging to the environment. Near me they also use salt preventatively, and dump it before the snow. This results in the salt becoming powderized, allowing it to travel vast distances. And if the predicted snow doesn't come, the salt can remain for weeks. I've also driven on many unplowed and unsalted backroads and parking lots, and have no problem moving in even my RWD vehicle with anything less than about 4," so it all seems a bit unnecessary. CMW.
