The Human Pangenome Project aims to gather, organize, and make accessible a representation of all genetic diversity found in people. The data could help reveal information about genetic risk for different diseases and conditions for individuals in the future. A technique called'long read' sequencing will be used to map full genomes from end to end. Some groups are wary of the effort and have rejected the proposal.
