I think the just-announced batch of Steamboxes will be largely unsuccessful. CMV I have a hard time trying to see why these boxes will find any success beyond some small niches. Vs. a PC you're getting a device that comes out of the box with arguably less functionality than a normal Windows PC (for PC prices). Additionally, you're getting a smaller universe of games (250) even compared to what's only on Steam (2500). I also heard (only a rumor) that there will be limited upgradeability due to form factorsdrivers? Vs. a console, you're not getting the comfort of knowing your device will be capable of playing the newest games for the next 5-7 years, and you additionally won't be getting any console exclusives. Because of hardware fragmentation, you won't be getting the optimization you see in a lot of console games. Anecdotally, I am both PC and console gamer, and have friends that are both PC exclusive and console exclusive gamers. I don't think any of them are interested in buying a Steambox, although they've shown intrigue in the concept. How to CMV: convince me there is functionality that justifies any of the boxes unveiled today.
