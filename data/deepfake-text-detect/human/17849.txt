Personally the idea disgusts me, as in that I'd never do it myself. But I don't see why others should be shamed or in some cases prohibited from doing this. I've never heard any arguments other than "Yeah but why would you wanna do that" or "eewww." Why restrict people from this if it doesn't hurt anyone? To be fair, I haven't had many discussions about this and I'm probably just missing some real obvious fact or something, but I don't know. Also, the slippery slope argument "It can lead to us marrying horsesfucking garden gnomes" is bullshit and won't change my view. Thanks.
