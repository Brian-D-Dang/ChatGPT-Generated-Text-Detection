I love Rosati's, and I've ordered from this store dozens of times. The staff is friendly and the pizza is awesome. We usually get either the thin crust or the Chicago style. So why only 2 stars? A couple of weeks ago we ordered a thin with cheese and a Chicago with pepperoni. I go pick it up, take it home only to find that the Chicago pizza's crust was severly undercooked. It was very obvious just by looking at it. Of course we tried to eat some but it was really bad. I call the store back and tell them, they offer to make another one. Come pick it up in 20 minutes. I drive back to the store and the manager (I think) is sitting out front and asks me why I'm back so soon. I tell her the pizza was not cooked. She makes some comment oh really?!? or something but never gets up from her chair. The kid working the counter brings out my new pizza and we open both the new and the old boxes to compare. It was very obvious that the original pizza was undercooked when comparing the 2. So my take on it is that they KNEW the pizza was bad and figured they could serve it to me and I wouldn't notice or complain OR the person cooking the pizzas is blind andor doesn't care whether the pizza is good or not. Either way, this is uncacceptable! And to make matters worse. All I got was a half-hearted lame apology from the counter kid. Not that I was expecting them to give me the pizza for free but come on! No coupon, no offer of any compensation whatsoever. Lame! Especially when spending almost 30 for 2 pizzas. But whatever, I might go back because I really do like the pizza but I think they need to step up thier game in the service department.
