Michelle always bought a breakfast burrito every morning. Yesterday she was late for work, but stopped for her burrito anyway. A man named Julio flirted with her inside the restaurant. They went on a date, fell in love and got married. After marrying Julio, Michelle stopped buying breakfast burritos.
