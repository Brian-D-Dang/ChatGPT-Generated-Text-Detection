Hello MrMagoo. I am a paralegal for a well respected estate planning attorney in San Francisco. We just launches an online estate planning website, URL0 and the FAQ covers many of these questions. The site is only for CA, but many of the questions apply to every state. Check it out and best of luck with the bar, estate planning is a great field to be in!
