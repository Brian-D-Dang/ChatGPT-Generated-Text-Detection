I am an atheist and a nihilist. Obviously, this has connotations: 1. I believe there is no objective, intrinsic, or otherwise purpose to existence. 2. I do not believe there is a higher power that would be able to instill such purpose. I started feeling this way after watching a lot of debates online, many of them involving the Christian apologist William Lane Craig. I have only begun reading Nietzsche's "The Will to Power," but I find myself agreeing with some of his points. There seems to be no way to come to an objective purpose of existence, as there can be no observation, experiment, or measurement to reveal such a thing. TL;DR: I am a nihilist. Please CMV.
