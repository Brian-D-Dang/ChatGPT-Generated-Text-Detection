Not sure what all the hype is about, but it's definitely not worth the hour wait outside. My group had wristbands and were on some sort of guest list, but that didn't really mean anything being that there weren't really any lines and there's just a mass of people pushing their way to get in. Why?...I really don't know. When we finally did get in, half my group of about 20 were already pissed off, not because of the wait, but because of the rude, power-tripping bouncersecurity guys out front. While waiting to get my handstamped, I saw the bouncer push some girl just because the tip of her 2nd toe had crossed the velvet rope. So not worth it, but if you're gonna bother, have a drink or 2 before so you're immune to the long wait and rude bouncers.
