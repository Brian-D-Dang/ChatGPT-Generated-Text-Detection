He's intelligent and wealthy and adaptable apparently. I think the majority of Gotham's problems could've solved with smart investments in social programs and industry and the police force which Bruce has money for. I swear the guy is anonymous being Batman, which means he can get away with killing, which would solve all his super villian issues immediately. How naive are superheros when same villains keep coming back. Considering his track record, you think he really can't his stance on the not killing rule. And even when it comes to I dunno fighting regular crime, I'm pretty sure a neighborhood watch group and 100 patrolmen would do a much better job than one guy flying around million dollar super planes. I think that just makes you an asshole. I'm done: You guys gave me more reasons to hate Batman more and superheros in general.
