Title is a bit confusing as I know no one can really do any magic, but I feel that camera tricks and excessive stooges are the lowest of the low in magic. (by excessive stooges I mean more than 20 of the people viewing the trick live are in on it and are actors.) It cheapens the trick, anyone could perform any magic trick if camera tricks or 100 actors are allowed. Working out how the magic trick was done is half the fun for me (and I think most people). Knowing it's all faked with no interesting trick is a waste of everyones time. There is suspension of disbelief, not only for that magician but then for all magicians. If I see a good trick now I'm more likely to believe it's just just a camera trick which cheapens the whole event. It even spoils the fun for magicians who do magic without camera tricks as people suspect it might be. It's just not cool. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
