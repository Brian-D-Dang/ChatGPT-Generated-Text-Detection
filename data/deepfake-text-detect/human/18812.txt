I think metal music is terrible as it does not include any of the features of a regular song. An example of heavy metal MESHUGGAH - Bleed (yes this was on the front page) 1) Metal music does not have any melody nor form. From an outsiders perspective it just sounds like noise. 2)Metal music lacks meaningful or understandable lyrics. Unlike most popular music nowadays metal music 3) The singers is screaming, which is again not understandable for most listerners. 4) The volume of the music is too loud. For most people in order to fully enjoy a heavy metal song the volume needs to be way through the roof. I do not think this is healthy. CMV?
