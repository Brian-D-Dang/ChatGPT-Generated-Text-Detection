I was thinking recently about what the future government is going to look like and I settled on a welfare state. Based on the assumption that advances in automation will render the majority of unskilled labor obsolete, I believe that A large percentage of people will be completely unable to find any work. This will be chronic, once that condition is reached it will never go back. The large numbers of unemployed will live on welfare, and that welfare will be able to provide a relatively comfortable lifestyle, they will have access to all of life's necessities and they will have access to some luxuries The small number of unskilled jobs that remain will support a very good standard of living, enough to encourage people who are otherwise comfortable to go to work The wealthy elite will still exists and will primarily be heads of business or government Professionals will fill the gap in between the unskilled and the elite based on the demand for their particular skills So guessing about the future is tricky at best, so I'll give deltas for convincing me my assumption about automation is wrong, or convincing me that any of my claims are wrong given my assumption. The heart of my view is contained in the first two bullet points. Also, I make absolutely no claim about when this will happen. It could be in 50 years or 5000, I just don't know.
