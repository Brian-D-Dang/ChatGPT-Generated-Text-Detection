I believe most religious beliefs are ludicrous, but these two stand out to me. Pagans - I just have an image of witches casting spells. Surely this belongs in the middle ages. Mormons - I don't understand the genuine craziness that comes from their beliefs. How can they possibly think a god dwells on a planet near the star they call "kolob." I'm not asking to have my view on their beliefs changed from thinking they're ludicrous to "I believe them now!," but help me understand why they're no more crazy than any other belief.
