As he spun around I saw the blur of black that extended from his hand. I was confused, but not afraid. I did not have time for fear. I just reacted. The impact of each step resonated through my body and time slowed down. One, Two. I turned on my heels and started to run. Three, Four. A second passes. There is hope. Five. My world exploded. A chasm ripped through my back as I was torn apart. Six. I began to fall forward. As I fell, the light faded away and the world went quiet. It was like the sun was setting very rapidly and everyone had stopped to watch. A black world engulfed me. I imagined my family and my old friends flash past me. Then a point of light appeared, it expanded, engulfed me. I jolted awake in a room I knew. It was my room from my childhood. Outside the door I heard voices. Voices I knew. Voices I had not heard for years. I was confused, but not afraid.
