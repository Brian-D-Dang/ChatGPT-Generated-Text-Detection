I've been pursuing a lot of scholarships and one of the things that irritate me is that there are certain scholarships that are not available to me based on my traits assigned by birth. (Male, Caucasian). I'm not trying to suggest that I am entitled to every single scholarship and this is by no means a vitriolic rant at people who do qualify for said scholarships. But I am specifically against scholarships that rely on people of academic or athletic standing as their criteria but exclude people for not matching into the group they allow applications for. There are people who may deserve a scholarship more, based on achievement, but cannot have the chance to even try. I'm sure that there must be a reason for this (as that's why I'm here today in the first place) but I can't find any reasoning that I can justify for such exclusion. Hello, users of CMV!
