Hi guys! To expand: Although I would happily call someone who went from being a man to a woman for example) a woman to their face and when talking about them, I still don't believe they are truly that gender. Despite having surgery, having that mindset and having hormone treatment, I can't feel fully comfortable referring to them as a woman - just from a technical standpoint. I feel as though I'm lying to myself. Disclaimer: I am not homophobic or anything of the sort. I completely agree with people doing what they want to do and I completely believe people can be'trapped' in the body of the opposite gender.
