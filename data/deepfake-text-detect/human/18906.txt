I have the ability to pull the plug on an entire cheating operation at my college. To be very frank, I feel very guilty about cheating. Throughout the years, I've been living at home, working jobs, trying to get done with this degree so that I could leave already. Well, needless to say, most of my classmates are in the same boat as me. And for several years, I thought I was the only kid struggling...until I discovered that half the class was in on a cheating ring. The professors are apparently very aware that cheating is quite rampant in our program. With a certain peice of information, I could expose us all and have us reap our just desserts. This would kill my shot at grad school and sink everyone else; but it would assuage my guilt and finally let me breathe easier. You might argue that what I'm contemplating is selfish, but what about this isn't? Literally 2025 are cheating in my course. When I say it's rampant, it's very rampant, and when I say it's hush-hush, it's very hush-hush. To be honest, I shouldn't ever have joined this program at seventeen. I didn't know what I wanted then. Now I do. And to be more honest, half the people in this program don't belong here. More than half. CMV Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
