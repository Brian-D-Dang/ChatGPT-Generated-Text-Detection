Definition of punishment: "The infliction or imposition of a penalty as retribution for an offense" Definition of rehabilitation: "The restoration of someone to a useful place in society" I see no moral justification in punishing anyone for any action. Those who demand punishment only obtain satisfaction. Those who are punished will cause more harm to society than if they were rehabilitated. If one society punishes and another society rehabilitating, the society which rehabilitates is better off than the one that does not. Being Norwegian, I can say that the perspective where one rehabilitates is way more normal here than in North-America, and (surprise) our society is better off in terms of criminal problems. Though there are many different reasons for that, I believe that our view on punishment is one of the essential reasons. We have murderers and child molesters working normal 9-5 jobs in our society, teaching them how to be good citizen, and it's rare that any criminals that are caught go back to doing crime. Rehabilitation can be perceived as punishment by some, and that is fine. For example, grounding your child might be perceived as punishment, but might in fact be rehabilitation. And yes, to get this over with right away, I believe the same goes for Hitler, Stalin, Fritzl or Anders Behring Breivik. Despite it would probably be impossible in the real world to do so now, it is still the correct way to approach it. I have a few more arguments, but lets start with this.
