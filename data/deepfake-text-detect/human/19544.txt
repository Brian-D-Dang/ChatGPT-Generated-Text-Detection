Physically, intellectually, and any other category of life I believe in general men are superior. I do recognize that there are very talented women in the world, some far better than men, but if you put the best man in a field against the best female in the same field I believe the male will dominate every time, no matter what the subject is. This seems to be true in academics, sports, and any other area in life. Even on a personal level I have found that girls are petty and silly, while men I have interacted with are far more interesting to have conversations with. I admit, I am very biased based on the fact that I have a male's perspective, but I have tried to be very open minded in talking to females but I find the majority of them dull and uninteresting. I think that the only successful girls in society are the ones that have natural ability (even then they don't get paid as much as men) or they use their looks to slide through life. Yes, I expect hordes of angry feminists to down vote me into oblivion (my sexism showing) and I could avoid this if I reworded my statements, but instead I'm choosing to pull on the oh so fragile female emotional strings. Instead of down voting me, prove me wrong. EDIT: You have all made excellent points. The error was not with the people around me, but myself and I appreciate all of your inputs, they honestly helped.
