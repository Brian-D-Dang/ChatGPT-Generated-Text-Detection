Salt pools in my mouth as the tears make their descent down my face, I'm gasping for air as my body attempts to sob one last time. I don't let it. I dare myself to look up and there they are, derision plain on their faces as they look down at me. One of them plays with her hair as a smile slowly spreads across her face. " Oh, I think he's done. Are you done? Or should we call your Mommy? " I wipe the snot off of my face and stare defiantly back into her blue eyes, but she doesn't flinch, even at ten years old her eyes hold more power than any teacher. I know now that this is my only opportunity. A growl escapes my mouth, surprising even me, and I shoot up from the ground. My hands meet her shoulders with a satisfying thud and she pinwheels her arms, trying to prevent the inevitable. When her butt hits the dirt I start to run, the expanse of the playground stretching out before me as I flee. She might be crying now, but I know that I will never cry again.
