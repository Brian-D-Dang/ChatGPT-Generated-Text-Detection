I apologize for my poor phrasing of the title. I can imagine that this topic pops up a lot in this subreddit but i'm new to rchangemyview and i'm still yet to be convinced. Coming from a strict country (Singapore) and now living in Australia, I don't see why people should be able to have such easy access to such a dangerous weapon. Admittedly one could argue that cars are just as deadly but they are a means of transportation. I hear that it's your right to defend yourself and i'm sure there are cases where someone with concealed carry has defended their lives from someone mugging them. But really is this completely necessary? Where I live now, guns control laws are in effect and people still get mugged and people still defend themselves this time without such a lethal weapon at their disposal. So is a gun really necessary? When somewhere gets shot up by a gunman I hear that it is a gun control problem, I don't believe this to be the case, instead I believe it to be a mental health problem and a problem with your society in general however if they didn't have such easy access to a weapon, would that have still occurred? I mean I can understand that someone could still get access to a weapon but having such easy access for what I see to be an unnecessary item seems like its making it a lot easier for people to make rash, impulsive decisions, or to make people carry out plans because they don't need to think through the part of the plan where they get a gun. Please change my view because I feel i'm rather close minded on this topic.
