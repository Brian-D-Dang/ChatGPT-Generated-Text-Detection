I have been hearing many people recently exclaiming about how our society is flawed, and use the fact that athletes make more than a job like teachers as reasoning to back up their view. My reasoning is pretty straightforward. Pro athletes bring in money to their leagues, and they deserve a fair cut of that money. While other occupations such as doctors and teachers do not generate as much money. I do believe that teachers deserve more money than they receive presently. However I do not believe that teachers deserve as much money as pro athletes.
