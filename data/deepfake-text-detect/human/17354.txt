I used to really like Bacon, but after I realized that Bacon has so much fat and calories, I decided to try Canadian Bacon. Canadian Bacon is basically just ham, but it has more flavor. When I tried it, I immediately fell for it. I loved that Canadian Bacon has more protein, less fat, and I think it tastes just like Bacon! Why is everyone else so obsessed with regular Bacon when Canadian Bacon is better in every way? I know most Americans love Bacon to death and are willing to do anything to eat it. I need all you Americans to change my mind. I just cant see anything good in Bacon! Change my view!
