To start off, I am of mixed race. My mother is Mexican, my father is white. While I have not experienced racism that can be comparable to someone of darker skin, I have experienced it. From both sides, both as a white and a Mexican. I basically am 'othered' by both sides. But that's not what this is about. A lot of people, when pointing out the racism people of color go through, mention 'reverse racism' (or racism aimed towards whites by people of color instead of racism aimed towards people of color by whites or other people of color). However, I think that's kind of a stupid point to make in the face of the systematic oppression POC face, and that, having experienced it myself, pales in comparison. I am in no way saying that white people don't experience prejudice nor is this prejudice that white people experience a good thing. For me, when a white person (and I have been discriminated against for being half white in a Mexican community) gets called a honkey, or a cracker, or whatever or is even bullied or picked on for being white, its not because people of color genuinely think that because that person is white, that person is below them. I think it's just bullying because that person is different from them, that person is not one of us. It is also in response to the racism that they face everyday- in order to escape racism from whites, they take preventative measures even if they don't realize it. On the other hand, being called something like beaner, spic, or wetback is much more hurtful (I've been called this when in predominantly white communities). When people say these things, when people make jokes about being Mexican (and jokes about race are fine at times, but some cross the line), when I am seen as just a piece of Latina ass, it is because people see me as below them because of my skin color and where my family came from. It carries more weight than calling me a cracker does. And it will always hurt more.
