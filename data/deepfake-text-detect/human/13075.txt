There are three commonly recognized stages of Empire. Maybe you know them. In case you don't, they're conquest, bureaucracy, and stagnation. Conquest is pretty self explanatory. Take over X, where X equals the landmass or society desired. Bureaucracy is pretty simple, too. The people who manage the empire directly after the conquest are usually pretty disciplined, and have a source of pride to maintain. Then comes stagnation. For whatever reason, people think that what they have isn't all that good, or that it runs itself, and they get lazy. This is typically where another conquest comes into play, but sometimes the stagnation gets so bad that there isn't even an empire to speak of anymore. I managed to conquer the world. There's now a friendly policeman on every street corner with nothing to do but to help the neighborhood, an efficient food distribution network, everything anyone really wanted out of a utopia. Scientific research is going along swimmingly. Research on what is anyone's guess, but things are most certainly being researched. And I'm bored. Bored out of my skull. I think I've started to realize why world peace never happened before now: it's so amazingly tedious. Even more so when the men you have govern various provinces are perfectly capable, reasonable, and loyal to the cause. There's no infighting, no drama, nothing besides the occasional terrorist attack. We've managed to prevent most of them, actually, and those we can't prevent we mock, very publicly. Nothing discourages terrorism more than no one taking them seriously. Maybe I'll try to play the bad guy. Maybe then I can start another revolution.
