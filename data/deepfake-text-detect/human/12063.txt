Conservative-run Bath and North East Somerset Council is holding a presentation of initial concept pictures of the redevelopment. Banes recently agreed it had to save PS2.6m from its PS351m budget in 2010-11. It also approved plans to spend PS200m over five years in projects, including PS33m in Keynsham town centre. The presentation is being held on 22 February at the Key Centre in Keynsham. A council spokesman asked that people who want to attend give the authority notice in advance.
