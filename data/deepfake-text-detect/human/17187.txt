I have spent a lot of money of digital downloads, music, film, tv etc. If someone buys a digital copy of something that should be considered property in the same way owning a physical copy is. The terms and conditions tend to state that by purchasing a film or track you are purchasing a licence to use it rather than owning the file itself, but this does not apply to any other form of media (as far as I know). If someone spends a long time and a lot of money building up a good itunes library, they should be allowed to bequeath that to their kids as they would their CD collection. Hello, users of CMV!
