..... I open my eyes. All I see is a ceiling. Rubbing my throbbing head I try to take stock of what has happened. I check my pockets. Empty. Sitting up I find myself in an all too familiar setting. Pool tables, jukeboxes, the smell of cheap whiskey and cigarette smoke. How did I end up here? I haven't had so much as a drop of alcohol in three years. A soft voice pierces the silence. "You have one more wish." Turning to my left I see an elderly man sitting on a bar stool; nursing a small glass of brown liquid. His unassuming grey suit appeared to be crinkled all along one side, whilst still retaining a level of elegance. The fluorescent lighting reflects off thin wisps of hair along his crown, and his face is framed by a pronounced jaw covered in a thick five o'clock shadow. The rest of the bar appears to be empty. With a brief cough I manage to find my voice. "What do you mean I have one more wish?" "Well for your second wish you begged me to undo your first wish. And by that vacant dumb look in your eyes it's seemed to have worked." The man smiled to himself. He drained the glass in his hand, placed it in the bar and walked over to me. "What now? I have places to be." I was in a daze. I wasn't sure what to make of any of this. In a panic I spluttered out the only words that were forming any coherent thought. "For my third wish I want to know who I am." "Funny..." the old man said, and then smirked as he clicked his fingers. "That was your first wish too." ..... I open my eyes. All I see is a cold, dark ceiling. The idea isn't an original idea, I remember hearing it somewhere long ago (off a friend perhaps?) but I can't find it anywhere with a google search. If anyone knows where the original idea came from I'd love to know:).
