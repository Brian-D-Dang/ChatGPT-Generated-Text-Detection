Charitable acts such as adoption, donating to charity and willingly saving someone's life but in doing so losing yours. I am not saying these opinions are wrong, to think that, logically it would appear this way, but it does take a "way of thinking" to consider this. I am talking about the sociopathic characteristics, 1. lack of guilt 2. a lack of moral sense. Lack of guilt is recognised as, if you believe every choice is selfish you therefore logically can not do any good without believing yourself that you've only done it for yourself and therefore any bad you do, you can only reasonably argue that you've done it for yourself so cant feel guilty because of it. A lack of moral sense because you cant feel right or wrong about something if you truly believe your motivation doing it is purely selfish I'll break this down into a thought process. possible actionmy choiceactionself gainmy choiceself approval Where people who do not think like this would think Possible actionis it right or wrong?choice TL;DR Its true everyone's choices are selfish, but if you chose to consider that in every choice you make, you cant have a moral sense or ever feel guilty. I apologise if my point is unclear badly written I am dyslexic but I try my best, if any of my points have been badly made i will try and expand on them and give in context examples.
