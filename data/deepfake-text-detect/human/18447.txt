Needle exchange programs send a bad message to schoolchildren. Providing needles to addicts will encourage drug use. We can not discourage drug use by taking a half done approach. If reducing drug use is a goal we need to have consistent message to both children and the world. I do not think these programs provide a major benefit to society. The majority of new HIV infections is the result of unsafe sex. Needle Programs only divert attention from that issue. It is really unlikely that a nation wide clean needle program would have any effect on the national HIV infection rates. Change my view
