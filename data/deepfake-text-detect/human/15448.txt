One word that describes Thai Spices is meh. Located in MeKong Plaza, it took over the old BoCa 7 space. When walking in the place, you'll notice its nice decor. alas, it was left behind by the previous tenant (yes that is real gold wall paper fyi). The place was quiet for a Friday night and we came there for my bday. Apparently happy hour is extended till 7:30pm but its not stated or noted anywhere. Since we had a big party, we ordered a multiple of their appetizers. The most notable ones are surprisingly not thai related. The crab puffs were very unique and good as well as the calamari rings. Who would of thought the secret sause (thousand island) would make a diffrence. After that, everything pretty much went down hill from there. The thai dishes were not very good. We had the pad thai, a little on the sweet side, plus the portions are a little small. Also the green curry was salty, I have a very salty palate, but even this was more than my liking. But it was good though, good with rice that is. Also even though we got it mild it still had a healthy kick of spices. The Thai fried rice was also mediocre and a lil on the oily side. The Tom Yum soup was good. Again nothing special but atleast it didnt taste off. Again this was a lil on the salty side too. The only notable dish that we had was the Papaiya salad with salted crab. That has a unique after taste. So in review, if you were at MeKong Plaza and had a craving for Thai food, then lucky you. But its not a place you'd actually actively seek out if you werent literally already there. Pros: -happy hour specials daily 4 to 7:30Pm (supposedly) -great happy hour specials that are actually delish! - great decor hahahha Cons: - food is sub par - thai specialties are sub par - thai tea wasnt a home run. - prices are not reflective of the quality and quantity.
