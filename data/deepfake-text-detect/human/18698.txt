I see in a lot of conversations around reddit and other places where people seem to take it for granted that Google just hands over user data to the government. I do not believe this happens, at least not in general. I'm aware that there are cases where Google is compelled to hand over data through warrants and what not, but I've never seen any evidence that there is some kind of relationship between the government and Google where the government can get at Google user data at will. I've also heard that Google employs ex-government employees, but that's not evidence of anything. Google employs tens of thousands of people with all kinds of work histories. Statistically speaking, a few are going to have backgrounds in the government. That doesn't mean there's secret projects to funnel Google data to government agencies. Hello, users of CMV!
