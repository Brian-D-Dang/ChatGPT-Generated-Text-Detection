I think that the stock exchange influences our congress to much in their decisions for themselves rather than the people. Private interests are a cancer in our government today and mostly revolve around money. This ban would have to extend to family as well due to prevent a loop hole and once again to keep money completely out of the equation when our politician are making decisions. This may be a bad comparison but lottery employees are not aloud to play the lottery, I believe theirs other bans the lottery has on others (please let me know if you know). This ban is because the workers have inside information or know how the system works (Statistical people). If our Congress and House have family and friends who own multiple large company converse they are sure to give insider trading information regardless if its legal or not. EDIT- Id like to clarify my statement of someall employees. Local officials, and lower level uninfluenced government employees should still have the option to dabble in the stock exchange. Sorry if this has already been discussed please link me to the thread if so.
